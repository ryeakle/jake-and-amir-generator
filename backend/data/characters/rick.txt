Right, exactly.

Epic.
No, no, wait, wait. Finish what you were saying.
No no, he's right. Sometimes it comes to fruition, and sometimes it doesn't.
Good one. Thanks for the advice, one.
Jake, you're going to let Amir talk to your girlfriend like that?
That seven twenty-two thing was weird though. Right?
Jake, you're going to let Amir talk to your girlfriend like that?
Amir, remember when you made Jake punch me?
Have you ever heard like a piece of your orbital bone or something like break off and maybe float towards your cornea-
It's just that I don't have health insurance and it's still kind of blurry-
I'm not sure, because there's a ringing in my ear. Remember the punch?
Yes, I heard that.

Ok, look man.  I need you guys to do me an omelette-sized favor.
Look, in about thirty minutes, a slew of farmers and cops are gonna come in here, looking for me.
Well, they're gonna be talking all sorts of insane BS, about how I've stolen thousands of--
No. What?
Tractors!
You seriously have a sick obsession.
Was your mom a.. a chicken or something?
Anyway, look. I need you guys.. to say that I was never here.
I'm fine! Be quiet!
And also you are screaming.
Yeah, you're not going anywhere.
I head you're the, uh, chicken whisperer.
Everyone.
Yeah, I need your help.
My chicken's more than sick.  It's dead.
...Oh my God!
Actually, dick, I'm here to tell Amir that I'm out of the bookie business.
My beautiful wife,  who is not a chicken...
She convinced me I need a more honest trade.
So I'm just here to collect Amir's eight-thousand-dollar quitting fee.
Mm. Cash.
I've spent all my life obsessing about...
Why are you always talking about eggs?
You are the only one talking about eggs.
Omelettes!
What did you say?
Say it again. Say it one more time.
You hear that, baby? I'm scary!
Mine!
His!
Next you're gonna tell us chicken nuggets  are made from real chickens instead of just being named after them!
I'm a cannibal!
Baby... I want you to kill me.
