Guess who?
What's up, brother? Oh, my god.  You must be Amir. I've heard a lot about you!
You were right, he can't even do basic math.
Yeah we do!
Shut the fuck up and help me find his pay stubs!
Really? Darn. Because I found a bunch of them right here.
Now I know you're a liar.
This is not good for you.
Give me that.
Yeah, sure thing! This dude just threw his cell phone against the wall.
Really? The very last person on earth?
Zing!
Later, dude.
You know, Jake said he worked with a bunch of 5's and 6's but you are a legit 7.
I probably see myself doing you if you know what I mean?
Lunch time?
Wherever. You're paying.  Come on.
Yeah, how many stitches did you get for that?
Stop them?! I told them where you were!
Hey, can I borrow 50 bucks?
Oh, so curious. That's why we called you the 'Curious C**k'.
Make it 60.
Geez, he doesn't save any of his Bank of America passwords.
Oh, my business plan of stealing money from Jake? It's going really well, thanks for asking.
Yeah. I know. That's why he's giving me all his money.  Geez, you are dumb.
It's called flying in your Russian girlfriend to Miami so that you can start a new life with her. Geez, what don't you get about this scheme?
You know what? I'm leaving tonight, so keep your trap shut until then and we'll be all good.
Thanks.
All right, Jake buddy, I am out. Remember our plan, OK?
Guess who?
