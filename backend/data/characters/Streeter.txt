Hi.
How are you doing?
Yeah
Velcro
I know.
Dude, dude, no.
Yes, shut up! Shut up!
No one can hear the song!
No one can hear the song when you're yelling!
Dude, stop!
They failed! Are you happy they failed the song?
Great, great! Now the girl's gone. Thanks, dude.
Shut up, SHUT UP!
.........nah, it's a different Amir.
Oy, Jacob!  No, just kidding.  Um...I have all the interns in the conference room.  Can you get in there and work on some Spring Break articles?
Good ones, please, this year.
You know what? It's not just Amir. Jake is totally insane. I lived with that guy. Certifiable, for sure.
No. No. No. Not all the time 'cause sometimes Amir goes in before him.
Have you ever had white cheddar ones, dude?
Shut up, dude. No one cares!
Guys, check it out.  I'm Pat, I love Yoda.  Get laid, I don't.
Uh, yeah.
Dont wake the f**king bear!
Dont wake the bear!
You. Dont. Wake. Me.
You dont wake the bear!
Sup, man?
Hey, uh, can you check with the illustrator, make sure the artwork's done for the weekend?
Awesome, thanks.
Have I ever said yes to that? It's almost impressive, and not in a good way, how persistent you are.
Not a compliment.
I don't even know what this is.
I can hear you.
AMIR what the hell are you doing?
That's a knife! Jesus!
Alright everyone, it's time for a push-up contest! Now you guys know the rules, alright? Everybody's got a counter, you gotta go all the way down, and no girl push-ups. Alright, ready?
Ready, set, GO!
Jake, can you just let him play, please?
Can you let him play?
You can share!
Hey Jake, man, we're gonna go try out that new sandwich place dude, you in?
Also Amir, that pizza you ordered is here.
Hey. H-hey.
What uh... What's going on?
Can you just let Kevin do his job?
Yea, right,  well that's part of his job.
Right at the desk?
I doubt that.
You do not have the right to talk down to anybody at this company.
You barely have a job here as it is.
I'm talking to you-
Amir
Kevin runs the videos on the site, he's not an intern. He's worked here longer than you.
Woah, woah.
Hey, hey, hey.. shhh, shhh. I do it too. I do it too. Hey, hey. I do it too, okay? I do it too, I do it too. It's alright.
Good night.
Ooh, guys, what's uh, what's going on?
Oh yeah! The Oscar pool!  You never sent that email, man. How'd I do?
Yeah.
Oh. okay. Well, how'd you do, then?
K, I want my money back, Jake.
Okay, you bought those boots ten days ago, man.  The day AFTER you collected my money for the Oscar picks.
Nobody likes you guys.
Shut up man, shut up.
Dude, I really really liked that. What is-
Well, not mumble not really.
Jake! Come on, let him play.
Oh, oh, oh! Who's talking about my niece like that?!
I'LL BREAK YOUR F**KING NECK!
Already broken.
Great new, guys: Q3 in the books -- hit our numbers, thanks in no small part to Chelsea, who gave that fiery passionate speech at the investors meeting -- really lit a fire under everybody's butt, so a round of applause for Chelsea. Thank you.
...Uh, Q4, though, is, um, who-- why-- what is he doing?
Why is that written backwards? Why is it backwards?
Can you clean the door please?
Fine.
Hey, no problem, buddy man. Hope it goes to something good.
Ohhh! Look at this, man. Whoa, look at all that meat!
Oh man, I'm gonna think twice about eatin' this thing.
Ohhh! Purple nurple!
Hey everyone, I'm Streeter Seidell--
Yeah right, exactly. Uh, I'm the editor in chief here--
Alright, c'mon.  And uh, my favorite food--
Alright I walked right into that one.
Okay, what?
Hey! Hands off the beef!
Amir is standing right behind you.
Sure, I'll take one.
You're the king!
I have a gay cousin.
Hey, Jake and Amir. You guys didn't come to the all-hands meeting and now Paul wants to see you.
Yeah. Are you making him cry?
Rod, dude, Rod! I came up with that shit.
Doub-- how're you gonna double-crank a small dick--
Y-- the little hairless-- little,  the little--
--but see, I want... I want the other way-- I want a big, like, bear of a man, you know what I mean? Like a giant--
--No, I don't want myself! Dude, a bit--
I know they would! But I'm talking even bigger! Like, I'm talking, like, a linebacker, you know?
Yeah.

Alright, next up, we have... Amir!
Nice! Nice.
Come on.
Ok-- Alright.  Okay! Well, that was awkward. So, if there's, uh, no other talents, then I think we can declare a winn-
