All right, so I kick her in the mouth, and go 'here's the three dollars I owe you, the tooth fairy will give you fifteen, keep the change'.
There is blood everywhere, her teeth were all over the desk.
Bro, the worst! Come here!
Hey, call me Dave. My friends call me Dave.
So I've got a question, guy to guy.
What's the- What's the deal with Amir?
No, I like him. I think he's really funny.
Classic. So good.
So funny. All right guys, got a question, guy to guy to guy.
What's the deal with Sarah?
As well as being in love with her?
Yeah, I'm probably still going to go for her.
Yeah, I mean if you haven't tapped it by now, it's probably never going to happen so, you know, I'm going to dive right in there.
Eat that right up.
Yeah.
I'll probably show her my motorcycle, let her ride that thing. Girls get wet for that stuff!
Slip 'n slide. That good! How do you not love him?
Nope.
Uh, let me think about it. F**k yeah.  Come here.
Hey, Sarah. Got a question for you, guy to girl.
What do you think about motorcycles?
Hey, you.
I like your bangs.
Didn't see you there, Jake.
You know it!
It's cocaine, dad. Relax.
How do you not love this guy?
All right, he's a grown man, man. He can make his own decisions.
Jake, I thought we were getting along.
Hey. Call me Dave, my friends call me Dave.
Fine!
Yeah, I do.
Yeah, Harley.
Yo did you show your dick to my girlfriend bro?
Oh my God, Jake. Someone call 911!
.) How could you have possibly fallen asleep during all of this?
You taught it?
Jake, Pat was in a serious car accident, so...
His brothers are at the hospital right now but uhm...
What?
Okay, calm down.
He's not gonna be fine, but he's not dead.
He may not walk again.
Okay, I think you should go home. Both of you should go home.
Jake's choking!
