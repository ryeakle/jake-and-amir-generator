Sup? I'm hurting my own ears.
Ey Jake H., I got Amir B. for ya. Should I patch him through?
This is Sam.
I lost a bet, I have to be Amir's secretary for a week.
I bet him that he couldn't eat McDonalds for twelve days.
Yeah, it turns out he had already been eating it for 42 dayshe showed me receipts.
That's even grosser.
Uh, should I put this motha through, brotha?
Ok, putting him through.
Well....
I'm just going to putjust dump this on the old Googy Cal...
It's going to be dinner with an H number 2 and night with an E.
K.
Do you know their... What special?
The skin of what.
Wait, wait, wait. You know the name of somebody who works at McDonalds?
You're gonna need to step out of Jake's office.... Get the fuck...
That's not true. Jake goes to the bathroom. Amir follows him to the bathroom.
Who am I, who am I right now?
Yes, I'm Amir.
Jake!
Sup!? It's Amir.
You said I couldn't talk to you for the rest of the day, and that's fine because Sam is going to speak for me, so...
Dinnah tonight? I'm thinking--What is she doing here?
Ha-ha. Yeah right.
LOL  What'd you think you're doing?  What'd you think you're doing?  Jake, what do you think--
Jake. Jake. Jake. Jake. Jake. Jake--
I just do nay think this ugly b-i-t-c-h should be talking for you, you are way too good looking. Straight up.
Wow, you're just saying that because you have a crush on her.
So why did you specifically ask to be her Secret Santa this year?  Really?
And why did you spend all day Sunday finding her a first edition copy of her favorite childhood book: Where ze Wild ziings Aren't?
Is it?
Hey, Jake, don't talk to me for the rest of the week.  Make that ever! You can give that gay-ass book to somebody else!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Through me.
Wow, that was EPIC!
Oh man, oh man! Amir, get the hell out of here!
Amir gave me like, promised three thousand dollars.
I'm already in his computer.
Jake is sick today so he wanted me to email him some stuff at home.
It's trash and this chat is with you.
He called you impossibly dumb and extremely lonely.
Searching dirt isn't going to get us- It's jake talking dirty to his girlfriend. I can't believe that worked.
That's nowhere in this chat.
We shouldn't be using Jakes computer in the first place. I feel ba- He left his facebook open too?!
You already said that.
Smooth.
Look at this; Jake isn't sick today, he's going on a job interview. that's shocking. You okay?
Move the sign.
Its too high.
We have one week left of shooting.
Theres no rap battle scene.
Theres no rap battle scene.
I know!
Id like to, what Ive was saying was--
Shut the f**k up--

I mean, its funny, but were losing daylight and were trying to make an actual show.
This is in actual show that needs to go on actual television.
Look at this; Jake isn't sick today, he's going on a job interview. that's shocking. You okay?
Jake isn't sick today.  He's going on a job interview.
hey if a future you communicated to you through the head set and said you were going to die, would you be scared?
me neither.
wasn't he wearing a cardigan?
I don't know what a cardigan is either...
I was making an educated guess.
Dinner tonight?
Super.
you know what we should do? We should go to the movies and see if they're good enough for you and Jake.
My parents are not how you say, alive.
They died in a plane crash.
they died in a plane crash.
Yeah, when I was four.
I think about my parents all the time.
Yeah, like I have you but who do you have?

It's july 22nd!
And when's mine?
I'm going to get some water.  do you want anything?
I am talking to you through the head set.

Miami?! I told my dad we'd have the car back in 20 minutes!
Good point. Ohh, 20 minutes from when we took the car.
He was very explicit about that.
So what's the plan? We get to Maimi? We find Jake, you and he become best friends, we all get matching tattoos?
Alright! For the tattoos I'm thinking Jake and Amir Foreva.
No Sam.
It would be an honor.
Yeah, E stands for not enough gas, idiot!
Fine, for now, gaswise. The tank is fine.
I guess we could hitchhike.
No no no, it's the hitchhikers that do the murdering.
I don't get why nobody's pulling over, I've been doing this for an hour.
Hey! Hey!

Yeah, we're going to see Jake Hurwitz.
Awesome.
That's great.
You guys got wall-to-wall carpet in your van!
Hey Sophia, how's it going?
Oh my god. I like you too.
I don't care.
Hey Amir, can I talk to you on the other side of the van for a second?
Hey man, I think I really have a chance with this girl, and I'd appreciate it if you'd back the fuck off.
It's just so rare that I have so much in common with somebody right away.
We both think I'm cute!
What do you mean I'm not her type?!
Yeah.
Okay he does not. He looks much more like moi than yoi.
I am looking at his dick!
That looks nothing like Jake's dick, Jake's dick doesn't have nearly that
Oh my god that's Jake!
Jake! Pull over!
Yeah psycho.
I wanna be a psycho.
No, there are no pornstars here. Just an awesome girl competing over mine and Amir's affection.
You know there's such a thing as overpreparing!
I can't believe we're on the Bangbus.
we didn't wreck it.
We totaled it!
It's totally fine.
YES Amir, this is what we have to do.
I feel I'm in Willy Wonka's porno factory.
We had a goldfish in North Carolina.
We also murdered a whole bunch of....... Hey look at this!

I'v done some community theater, and some background work on law and order.
It was implied.  Ice Tea was a total sweat heard, we used to call him sweat tea haha.   Can I unhook your bra?
no.

jake: exactly, do that.  Me and Amir will sneak out the back and met you in the hospital and we'll bust you out from there.

Yes .
Wait, wait, wait!
I don't like this. Go home, Jake.
