There he is.
Let me see those hands.
So I can shake them.
Permission to congratulate the hero that saved my son's life.
Understood.
I was walking my child to daycare when I heard gunfire. A lot of people were dying, and I froze. But this brave, brave man stepped forward and took my son off my hands so I could apprehend a murderer.
WOW. Permission to kick this man's ass, sir.
Let me see that.
Now it doesn't say anything.
Permission to hug my son again, sir. Permission to squeeze his rosy cheeks.
Yes, very much so.
You are the boss of me.
Permission to break this perp's arm, sir!
NYAHHH!!!
