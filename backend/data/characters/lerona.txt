Hi.
Hi.
Yeah, but it's Leron-uh. Like you're confused.
Hi!
I missed you.
Sup!
Why would you yell at Amir?
Nothing, I just came to surprise Amir. Take him out to lunch.
I love McDonald's. Don't you?
Oh my god, is that an Aragorn action figure?
No, I love Lord of the Rings!
What's your favorite one?
Ugh, I know what you're gonna ask me.
And, I mean, I know Amir's not the smartest guy, but he's really genuine. That's what I like about him, he's just not about
Oh. Can I ask you a question?
Will you promise not to tell Amir I said he wasn't the smartest guy?
Thanks.
Jake and I were just talking about Lord of the Rings.
I was talking about the movies.
No...
He meant madam.
Do you call him out like that all the time?
Sorry, forgot my sunglasses.
Don't be embarrassed. That was cute.
It's Sunday.
You make me happy.
Hey... where are you the most ticklish?
Maybe here...?
Sorry.
Ugh, your phone has been ringing all morning, go answer it.
Hello?
He's at my place.
Oh, um, it was fun, Amir and I went to the park and we flew kites.
Sorry, Amir was tickling me. What did you say?
He wants you.
I'm sorry, I have something that I really need to ask you, and-   You can say no, but, I just- Amir and I got in a fight, and-
You're his best friend.
And I wanna make it up to him, what should I do?
Never mind, this is stupid.  Amir would be pissed I came here anyways, I should go.
It's what our whole fight was about.  I said that you were cute, or something.  It was really stupid.
Really?
Yeah.
Why wine?
Oh, sheesh y'all.
Sorry.
Maybe...I should just suck his dick.
All this effort?  Wouldn't it just be easier for me to just throw myself on him?
Hear me out.
If you and I were together, and we got in a fight, and I came over, and I was totally naked, and I was like Do whatever you want to me.  Be as dirty as you want, you wouldn't like that?  If I was totally naked.
Ohmygod, it's so good.
Yeah.
Ohmy- you can't tell him that I'm here.
They are.
I came here to make you these cookies.
Ye-yeah.
Yeah.
You're awesome.
You're awesomer.
What say we go back to your place and eat these in private?
Hello?
Huh?
I can't hear you come upstairs. I'll buzz you in.
It's open
What?
I am calm!
K, coming.
Hey!
What?
I have a boyfriend
I don't know I'm really confused now
I think I'm gonna go by myself. I have a decision to make
Hey.
So, I made my decision.
It was really tough. Jake, you're so thoughtful and smart and really cute... so I choose you!
No.
Yeah.
I chose Jake!
No. No. Listen, I'm... I'm really sorry.
So...
I feel like such a bitch.
Guys! Guys! Stop it, stop it!
I'mI'm not a ghost?  OH!
I'm Lerona's twin sister.
I'm Jessica.
Okay, well
What, uh
No
Anyway!
What?
Yeah, well, so are you two!  I mean, youyou act like a four-year-old in a twenty-eight-year-old's body.
And youJake, you stole your best friend's girlfriend, and then you killed her.
Oh, and by the way, fedoras are not stylin'.
Because I'm not Lerona's twin, okay? I am a ghost. I came back here to see what nice things you guys would be saying about me, and instead, you're flirting with my fake sibling and talking shit about me.
You know what? Whatevers. Bye.
We're not transparent, you know! It really hurt.
It did.
It did.
