Eeeh, Jake, the pizza's here. Oh...
You puked on it.
Oh hail to the milk man, the milk man, the milk man, okay, hail to the milk man, the milk man is me. I take milk from cows and I give it to men
I'm sorry son, are you afraid of milk, should I hide the milk?
Listen up everybody, someone's got to slow their roll, okay, I don't know what you're talking about!
Sure.
Ooh, sounds fun, but it wasn't me.
How dare you? Remember the milk man, the paper boy, the evening TV?
What song? I haven't heard a song in my life. Did the man that sucked your penis have a beard?
Ah Jake, friend...
I have a beard! Is that your name? Was he a milk man?
Ah, sorry sir, I have been a milk man my entire life. I bring milk to man, much like how a mail man brings mail to milk to man!
We're totally different people.
My name is Ca... Charles.  You hear that??
And my last name is Croooshtoost.
Do you want some milk? It's very heavy!
Do you want some cottage cheese?
Okay.
Absolutely, I have July 13th.

My friend, I've got to go, I'm so sorry. If you find the man that sucked your penis, tell him nice milk man outfit. I've said too much!  Good, good, good, good, here I come, Milk Man to the rescue. We got that August 13th, open wide, here we go  open wide, good man! We're good to go! We're good to go! Milk man, milk man, milk man! And that'll do it, Amir that's the whole bottle. Do you want another?
You got it friend!  Everybody wants to be okay at the milk man!
I'm a doctor.
Jake, there's only one thing that could save this man's life: Do you have any milk?
God... Damn it. Where's the milk man when you need him. We're gonna have to do this the old fashioned way.
