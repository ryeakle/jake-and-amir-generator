Guys, welcome to the studio. Thank you so much for coming. We're going to learn some carpentry today.
Awesome, well welcome Amir. Thanks for coming.
You don't have to leave at all.
Oh... I don't want to make you leave.
Too strong? Well... I have a drill!
Alright Jake, what you want to do is measure this to exactly 12 inches, ok.
No, carpentry.
No I, I wouldn't.
Just, right in the center of the X like, right in the middle of the palm.
Jake, that turned out really well, man-
Wait, where's Amir?
Oh my god.
