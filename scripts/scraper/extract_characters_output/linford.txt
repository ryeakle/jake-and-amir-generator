first cousins.
i'm your only first cousin.
anyway, your mother is worried, you haven't picked up any of her calls...
...for close to six months.
she even sent the police to your apartment yesterday.
here, use my phone, call her now.
well your mother lost you once, she wouldn't want to do it again.
yes, when amir was six he was abducted from a shopping mall, and returned at the age of 11. he had forgotten how to speak.
he survived on a diet of chicken nuggets.
uh, next to that guy? no thank you. he smells like fishsticks.
so, at least we have a reason. ohh! do you mind if i check my email?
yes you mind, but i can still do it?
uh, amir practically begged us to come here.
so, wow.
