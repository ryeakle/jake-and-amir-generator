my brother-in-law and i have devised a way to steal large animals from circuses and zoos. if you're really certain about this, i can get you an elephant.

i don't want to say how or why, but i have recently come into a surplus of elephant meat.

alright. can we go?
 i didn't touch a single tusk!  not one tusk!
