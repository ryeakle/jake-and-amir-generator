i'm sorry is this a bad time?
it's mr. greenberg right? 
ok. i'm meryl. and i'm an intern here, and i really need to go home early today.
it's kind of private.
i just found out i'm six months pregnant.
that's too late to terminate. my parents hate my boyfriend and they think i'm still a virgin. they're gonna disown me. i dunno what to do.
 i know.
randy doesn't know yet.
i'm an intern. i was in here trying to cut out of work early to go to this fucking rave but this jackass has been grilling me so hard that i have to come clean. he has a keen sense of right and wrong and a true gravitas about him. in fact... permission to sit on your face?
