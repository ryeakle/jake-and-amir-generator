hold back, hold back, hold back.
moo moo.
oh! you're not a cow.
ugh, the way you were using your cow-y fingers i was almost certain of it that time.
 cows has hooves!  you hear that, tree? cows has hooves.  next thing you're going to tell me is that top hats don't have tops. 
i can't draw a cow. there's not enough time.
okay, stop. you could give me 2 months straight and all i have to do is draw a cow, and even then, i couldn't draw a fucking cow.
we can talk about cows until they come home, but the fact of the matter remains your friend is missing and we must find him
the hunt is on. do you have your safari hat?
good.  you're gonna need it.
