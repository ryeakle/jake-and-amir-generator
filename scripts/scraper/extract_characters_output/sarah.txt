i don't know. i mean jake still gets really annoyed. 
well, that's true. and, i mean, amir like sleeps over jake's house constantly.
that's so true. you know, if you didn't know them and you're explaining them to someone, you could almost make an argument that they're like . . .  
i mean they're probably not, but it kind of seems like . . . 
. . . like they're gay lovers. 
i mean, i'm just saying. i mean, the family visits, the sleepovers, they're always getting into these like lover's quarrels. 
yeah, i mean . . . maybe. it's stupid, it's probably wrong, but...
yeah. 
no, it's ok. it's--
it's fine. i mean, i just thought we weren't going to, uh...

oh, i didn't know you took french! that's good!
jake, c'mon, just explain it to him.
yeah but who's julian assange?
yeah--
anyway, amir, julian assange is the founder of wikileaks, this website, and he recently got arrested for sexual assault on a swedish warrant, so. it's kinda like an international--
ipad.
