you know it's actually really cool.
rosy wasn't that good?
yeah. that would be cool.
nah, no it would just be so cool and funny if you just took the escalator back up.
is it?
you didn't bring a pie.
you weren't holding that in your hand when you came up 
you should take the stairs back down. 
hell yeah, two at a time that would be really ace.
hey take the trampoline back up, just jump as high as you can. then we'll go to my apartment and do the "elevator, escalator" and the "stairs" all night man we could hang out.
as long as you can as long as you'd handle that.
