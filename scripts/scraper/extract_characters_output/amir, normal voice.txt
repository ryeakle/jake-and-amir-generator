ok, obviously i wouldn't say anything unless it really really hurt, alright. you know me man, you know i keep silent unless it kills, but it really hurts.
ok, you know what? how about you smile and i'll throw one of these pebbles in your mouth, we'll see how you like it, ok?
ooh see! oh wait no, you can't because i threw one of the pebbles in your eyes and now you can't and you won't shut up about it. but when i do it i'm a huge dill-weed, so how's that fair? huh?
