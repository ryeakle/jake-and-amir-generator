uh, you didn't call this meeting.
hey guys, thanks for coming. let's start the table read
i meant the table read. it's when we read the scripts that were written this week, at this table, and then i get a sense of how to direct them. 
amir, let's start with your script because it is by far
the longest is what i was going to say
it doesn't. you wanna pick your cast?
 alright, let's just get started.
okay, um...  interior: doesn't matter. day. a shot of an empty room for three hours.  we can't do that.
 in stumbles our hero, darrel mcmexican. he looks just like jake, a buff and a cool. 
  as darrel grabs his heart, not just his chest but literally he grabs his heart, his girlfriend enters. 81 years young, jet black hair, like a jet, has pussy sandwich for a name.
 pussy sandwich let's out a high pitched queef. we can't hear it, but everyone knows it's there for sure. dogs from around the city start sprinting to mcmexican's apartment. we hear thuds, barking, pounding. these dog's wanna get in and see what's what. they know it's coming from pussy.  what they don't know is how or why. 
help! a fucking pirate did this to me!
more like rebecca hobo!
 you killed me!
you know, the swelling on my larynx is actually subsiding--
not again!
 poor form, jake.
it was well within the confines of the game!
yeah. go home, jake.
