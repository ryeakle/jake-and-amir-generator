i said, i'm gary-
wait wait wait, okay.  are you guys on facebook?

ustream?
friendster?
are you guys active at all?
actually, i am.  you know, a healthy lovelife really impacts the workplace.
woahhhh
alright guys, here's what we need to do to make collegehumor go huge:  you need to hustle, crush it, and go big.
they're not.  hustle is to crush it.
no, that was go big
crush it
thank you, comprende.
jake, the number one thing is to respect your co-worker.  it's family. 
you guys are friends, right?
take amir to a water park, an arcade, a picnic.
i-i-i think amir's cousin, leron, runs a laser tag in queens.  why don't you guys go up there and laser it up?
jake, amir's right.  don't worry about the traffic.  become best friends.  family.  and it will all work itself out...or not.
dude, now you're getting it.
