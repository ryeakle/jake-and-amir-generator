alright, i thought of a good idea for a-vimeo and that's, it's called quick characters, where i create a character and then i ssh put the camera on jake or he creates a character and he puts the camera on me.
a guy who didn't, who just didn't get a raise but bet somebody the amount of the raise that he wouldn't get it. so he's a little disappointed from a career standpoint but he's still gonna get the money from a friend.
what happened?
 why is that?
nah, i was just kdding about that.
oh, no. i was sort of kidding about that.
i'm not gonna write you a check.
okay.
why gotta go make things so difficult for me. you don't act to three. one two.  sbray nga-i don't want it too. one, i'll be in the car.
a guy who takes a drink out of his water and it taste like his own urine, and he wants to tell people that it taste like his own urine but he can't because then he would have to explain the fact that he's one drinks, that he's once drink his own pee and he doesn't wanna do that.
like what?
yes, every single issue... . you can come by and get... . i need to tie my shoe . i have to go.
a guy who is just planning on go to, on going to dinner with his five friends but then one of them just told him that de, it's sort of a reservation and they only have five. so he's just gonna have to stay back.


 i mean, don't just say you're not gonna do it. 'coz if you're not gonna do it, baah then you shouldn't be holding a camera right now. i'm being serious. like, honestly, don't even film this. i'm being completely serious right now. if you're not gonna take it seriously, i don't even wanna be part of this thing. like i just hanged out to this project because i thought you were gonna help produce it, but you're not gonna help produce it . ha ha!
all right, this is a 30 second debate between myself and jake. uh, jake. what do you think about global warming? do you think humans can slow it down or is it just an unstoppable force? should we not even bother? should we be like, you know what? i'm gonna drive my car and i'm gonna eat my gasoline and i'm gonna do whatever i want because i'm an american?
i can't. i can't...let's do that again. i can't hear you when you do like fast forward talking. so just talk normal.

it is gonna work, just stop--
jason, you weren't supposed to see this. get out! 
or--or anything. i'll send you an email or a fax. let's do that again.  
jake, can i trust you?

okay. you scared me!
 ughhhhh...
i don't know how people do it.
no, you don't know what i meant. i meant, i don't know how people get tattoos.
just, forget about the meeting, how-- when you got your tattoo, did it hurt you? who else has a tattoo in the office? now that i'm inked up.
now that i have ink.
you're treating me so different now that you know that i have a tattoo.
it's embarrassing telling you this shit because i don't-- i don't want--
i dunno, it's a tattoo.
okay, what is this?  what is that of? that's not of anything, but it's still a tattoo.
mine's a bear. okay?
i dunno, in the woods or something.
let's get-- let's go to a fucking bar.
i haven't felt this interrogated--  get-
it's not on my shoulder or anything, it's just like on my.. area. what does it matter?

i'm trying to play a joke and fuck you, man, that's all i get back? i'm sorry, wow. i'm a dick for playing a joke. on my friend.
someone i thought was my friend, at least.
why are you untying your shoes? that means the joke's over, that means our relationship's over. when you fell over, i laughed, because i respected you. how wrong i was. shame on me.
 i don't even wanna talk about it.
funny, right?
so act, act like it's funny.
and there's that effort again! you didn't... forget it. 
so drunk...
last night i got so drunk...
i had like, so many beers.
i was like retarded...

 i know... how many is believable?
i know, twelve... i had twelve.
i had twelve beers, yeah. ssstupid afterwards.
sweet. so sweet. like sug-- what?
just like you're drinking... like you're drinking a sourdough baguette.

you are?
why, what are you, what're you doing tonight? how many beers are you gonna have? i'll double it, easy.
take a drink before or after, whatever you drink--
...so sick.
oh, i'm writing an email, cause a friend of mine emailed me.
yeah, he was like writing me an email, so i'm emailing him back
not the exact same pair. yours are yellow, right? i can'tyeah, they're yellow.
oh the idea. i didn'tyeah i didn't know you invented sunglasses. that'si guess that's why i messed up because i didn't know you invented sunglasses. why are you even still working here? can't you live off the royalties of wearing
why are you wearing a blue shirt today? i'm wearing a blue shirt, and your new rule is that nobody can wear the same thing, right? so, i can't wear a blue shirt if you are?
yesterday they were gay. but then people said that they liked it, so i got a pair of my own. i mean, i'm allowed to change my mind.
i'm getting a call.
it's on vibrate mode.
yeah, it's like call-forwarding, so iti don't really know how it wor hello? hello? ah, shh, i lost her.
oh, i forgot to tell you. i thought of the chillest screen name last night. it was so chill. it's like the chillest thing i've 
it's chilldude22. two-two. chill dude two-two.
i know. it's so good.
it's fly as hell. that's why i love it so much.
i know, but it's not a big deal if i'm just, like, putting uplike, throw up an away mess, and i'm just like, hey i changed my 
jesus, actually no, it's not.
damn, that's like the chillest one i've ever thought of!
it's more than tough.
you know, i'm gonna add the name chilldude22 to my bumy bl, and i'm gonna check out if this chill guy wants to swap.
whoa, he's actually online.
maybe i should im him and ask him if he wants to switch. hey.  wanna swap names?  what's going on? hello? hi. it's you, man!
did you steal my chill screen name?!
i mean, i'm gonna tell you what it is because it's such a chill quote that it belongs with that screen name, but: she says we 
i'm supposed to be the chill dude.
we did it!
torn. just this, it's like about a guy who just walks around beating people up. and he like, stabs people in the neck and then just plays with blood. and beats the shit outta people for fun. hwoh, hwoh.  i figure for high five, we just come down, and it's like nothing's right. we're torn.
i put it on my workout mix cause it's like so, it's just core. just... 
no, but... come, on let's do just one more high five, we'll choose like the manliest song,  it'll be about like the terminator or something, just like, killing people, one more time! up high! super sick! let's do this!
come on, man!
: 180... 180.  get off the phone, man. we're at work.
we're not supposed to use the phone at work.
what's the best you can get on an iq test?
180 is pretty good though, right? highly gifted it says...
i took an online iq test, i got a 180. pretty...
psht, no. it didn't say that. it didn't say to.
10. so hard.
wrong.
ok yeah, that's the one i got wrong. so 9 out of 10. that's... still pretty sick...
i mean, look...  they're so... you wouldn't be able to get any of these...
yeah, first 3 were on a banner ad. so...
we'll see what the scam is when i get my diploma.
49 bucks, but it comes in a sick frame.
psh, it doesn't mean anything... i'd like to see... i'd, i'd onestly like to see how you do.
only people who get 180 or more even get the opportunity to buy the diploma, so i don't see why i shouldn't.
it's not... seems easy, but it's not...
figure it out. if you're so smart... you think you can get a better than a 180, you could figure who turned off your monitor.
not saying it was, not saying it wasn't.
let's make a deal.
if i plu-
huh?
i dunno. was it me?
yeah, i mean, sometimes it says 'restricted'.
maybe.
 ...so smart.
hey. dinner. tonight. 8 o'clock.
ice cream? you want ice cream?
probably can't... probably can't get ice cream unless you finish your dinner.
come on, man. don't be some loser who stays at home.
i'm sorry, listen. i shouldn't have called you a loser. let me come over, make dinner, we'll eat it together, i feel like a huge... i feel like a dick ever since i made fun of you.

yeah. that's how i do a bull, it's so weird. it's like 'ruff'.
...... ruff!
let me just finish editing the whole thing, and then we'll watch it all. instead of watching individual part by part, we'll just watch it all at the end. 
those have been done. i mean, we're not gonna make a mentos ad anytime soon.
the thing is, you can't put a price on faces, so every face, like that face, is priceless. 
that face is, like they're all, they're all priceless regardless.
i'm not gonna look.
you know how yesterday, when i was like 'you probably don't get it', like, when you make stuff, like when you make suggestions like that, i'm pretty sure you don't get any of these jokes. like, what's funny about this one?
no. it's not it.
why is the high-five one funny?
no, it's not... the joke is never
the joke is never because blank is gay. that's never the joke. it's not because kite is... 
it doesn't even... it's not even part of the joke.
stop! listen, i come up with the ideas, i edit it, and then you do the other parts.
hey jake.
what's that?
ok. i didn't get why you did the gun thing, then. 
i'll do it.

i'm not!
that's funny.
 a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.
just a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. it's one of those days.
i'm not referring to anything, it's just like a.. it's like a proverb. you just say it when there's silence in the room just to say something.
they don't--none of them mean anything, you just say them, like don't count your chickens before they hatch! or something.
yeah, that one means--that one probably means something but like all these other ones don't like mean anything, like keep your nose to the grindstone! or whatever.
well you come up with one that doesn't mean anything then!
not all of them. not all of them.
let me explain it to you. i don't think i'm explaining it right. if i'm sitting here in silence and you're also sitting there, i'll just be like don't get up on the wrong side of the bed this morning! and then you'll be like  whatever you tip your cap or whatever.
pssshhh.
don't make a mountain out of a molehill.

yeah, mine...specifically.
my job is in danger i just wanted to make this like a team thing..i know that if i got fired you'd come with me.
so i wrote down some ideas because i know..yeah we can work here at college humor til we're like sixty-five but we should always be thinking about the next......
the next......
alright, first idea. you know how barry bonds is in the home run thing? like he's about to break the record?
so, this website would text you when he hits the big one, when he hits number seven-fifty-five.
okay. second idea is if you loved the barry bonds idea--
okay.
okay. okay. it would text you whenever anybody hits a homerun.  
facebook for college students. so it's like a facebook site but just for college students.
okay, just say..if you don't like something just say next 'cause it's a long list and i don't wanna waste your time.
and you don't wanna waste mine.  
global internet. portal site.
discount electronics.
okay, so let's discuss. i'll put a star by it and then let's talk. i was thinking five dollar digital cameras at first.
two dollar dvd players.
this one's actually kind of cool it's--you step on your laptop and it weighs you. it tells you how much you weigh like a scale.
scale.com
okay next one is...nicknames everybody loves them, nobody has them. i don't know what that meant. any idea?
funny chinese names.
uh, an alphabetical database.
anything.
okay.  
uh, imdb but no actors. just the movies.
yes.
alright, a website that says god bless you or gesundheit for when people sn--
...sneeze around the office. no good or good?
okay, say that don't mumble.  can you hear what i'm saying now or not 'cause i'm mumbling?
okay.  
okay this one's actually kind of neat. it's a telephone for deaf people. so when--
so when deaf people cannot use the phone--let me finish! it's so frustrating! i know you're not doing it on purpose but--  
i just have a couple..a couple more.
um, okay i have like--
i have--
yeah, okay. yeah.

jake i said i was sorry. what else do you want me to do, i  don't deserve this silent treatment.
can i least show you what the wrestling move would have looked like, if you didn't ruin it.
the thing is you were scared last time, if you could just conquer that fear, i think, it will look, really, really boss.
uh, your head goes in between my thighs and i suplex you off the table, and, listen my knees will hit the floor before your face, so don't brace your fall.
i mean that splint is just as much your fault as it is mine, if not more yours because you're the one that actually put his wrist down

we soared in the air as two people but we landed as one.
 i'm the one who wants to be with you. be with you.
what?
really?
i mean, i did choir in, like, fifth grade.
but not 'cuz i wanted to, because my mom said i had to do something after school, and i didn't want to do basketball 'cuz i was too good, not because i like singing.
who would walk around singing?
hey. did i get, uh, a fax? 
amanda, i had a question for you. 
so weird that that happens.
you want me to sing during it?
thank you! it sounds good, man. right?

no duh. like i want to be good at singing. that's a gay sport.
mom, you are not coming up here. you do not come up here. that is so un-ace of you.
of course you wouldn't get what that means. it's an inside joke between me and my bestest friend in the world. 
listen, if you come up here, you're going to embarrass me, you're gonna embarrass me more than you've ever embarrassed me before. 
just leave the cake with the security guard downstairs and i'll get it on my way home. bye.

you don't get it, man. she's embarrassing as hell. 
first of all, she came here. she came here with a cake. she wants to come upstairs, meet everybody, give cake to everyone like it's a frickin' kindergarten class.
you don't get it. that's...
honestly, and i wasn't going to say anything, just-
ok. you just, you look like a gaylord.
ok. classic example. freshman year, she sends me cookies in the mail because it's was my birthday, right? i couldn't throw them away, i had to flush them down the toilet because i was afraid everybody would see them.
ugh, hold on a second. what? oh my god, i don't need a laptop, i already told you. just give it to the maid, i honestly... goodbye.
it's like... do you have anyone in your life that just pisses you off, annoys you so much you wish you could just tell them off?
but you secretly love them?

no, that's the worst part. i had to like, follow squirrels and try to club them over the head with a fishing rod.?
 my leg! 
i took a cab.?
i thought of halloween costumes for us.
blood brothers.
uh, this is just a key, but i'm ready to do it with a pin if you are.
ok.
you're just saying that to impress your friends.
any friend. anything.
why do i feel like i'm the only one working on this?
maybe you should.
definitely. 
i guess i'm acting weird because i lost a brother today.
yeah.
no. it really hurt last time.
look at your desktop.
 oh, man.
it's an old fashioned prank, son. it's my parents having sex, and it's on your desktop.
i put a picture of my parents having sex, and now it's on your desktop.
what?
what are you doing?
come on! stop! this is a prank for you, not for her!
stookay, no.
i don't want you to be embarrassed.
come on.
don'tcome on! stop it.
no, don't come here! please! i'm bejake, i'm begging you, please do not comeit's not! it's a joke, it's a prank! please! what 
come on, stop. it's just a prank for you!
there's nothing to look at!
prank over. okay? everyone had their fun, right?
i wanna prank you, but you made me feel bad about it.
you think so?
don't open it!
why don't you pass the axe, bro? i'll show you how to really shred. shred so hard.
give me the triangle plastic disc.
the disc, yeah, the dick. pick.
did you even, like, tune this axe? i taught myself how to play guitar.
so. pretty fly for a white guy.
nah.
easy. 
it's a pick.
when i taught myself how to play guitar, uh, i knew two chords.
hold on a second.
stop, stop. this... you messed it up. 
yeah. and now...
honestly, when i came in here and you were playing guitar, i thought you were playing the electric guitar. this is the only guitar i know how to play.
i'm sorry for confusing you, how many times to i have to apologize to you?
i just, i'm starting to feel like crap around you, man. it's just, i don't know what i'm doing wrong. 
like, i got 15% on free bird the other day, i activated super power and just didn't mean it.
i can't even talk around you anymore. 
ever since, i don't know, ever since she came i just feel like crap.
my playstation 3.
i don't shred by taking things, like, easily, you know? look at this.
woah. wow. hello.
uh, yeah. actually, no. i was... i'm in the bathroom now.
sorry, lavatory. i mean, what's the difference, anyway? there's nothing a little notorious about this place. 
i mean, like, it looks like a bathroom, but they call it a lavatory. i just, i don't get it.
i don't know, i mean, i was lonely as hell, so i tried to see if this would work.
ok, sorry. 
no, don't! i'm bored as shit! 
ok, fine. i'll call you when i land.
hello?
what was that? 
what? are you ticklish all of a sudden? 
nothing... i have to go to the bathroom.  
so you're not ticklish! 
 do bald people have to like shampoo their scalp???
i guess it looks like one of those questions nobody will know the answer to. 
it's a rhetorical question. ?
why?
just turn your monitor around.
i know it's going to be one of those disgusting sites.
get off the phone though.
okay, if it's personal you should definitely get off the phone.
jake get off the phone.
it's before six. you're not supposed to be making personal phone calls before six.
earth to jake: get off the phone. it's so annoying.
no personal calls before six, that's a rule, and the reason it's a rule is because it annoys people when you talk.
if he's going to be okay he's going to be okay at six, if he's not okay he's going to be still dead at six.
seriously, if you're going to call your sister, go out, do it in the lunch room, on your cell phone-
oh i'm sorry are you crying because i disciplined you? well guess what jake? this is the real world; there are rules and bosses discipline their employees if they break those rules, right? 
okay, wow. i didn't realize you guys were so close. come on man, let's go get fro-yo or something. do you have five bucks? do you have five bucks though because i don't think i have- i don't think i have it on me. i really think it will cheer you up.
no
no
i'm not playing
no i'm not
no, i'm not, i have to go to the bathroom.
ah! fuck man! what ah what the hell is your problem?
ha! it appears as though the mentor has become the mentee 
you see, what you don't get jake is, when it comes to keep away the hand is quicker than the eye, jeff!
ok, i quit, forget it then, i don't wanna play.
what?
listening to dvds.
i don't know how to put it in.
what are you listening to?
jake's listening to bowling for soup!
you like bowling for soup?
you were listening to a banner ad for two minutes? you were singing along with it.
 hey
jake listens to bowling for soup.
what?
are you serious?
i'm leaving.
 aaaaahh.
uhhhh.
not. i can burp.
you know when you burp and you throw up a little and you can taste it in your mouth?
dinner tonight?
 look, a taxi cab over there, it look like it's britney spears is driving it. it's all over the place.
 did you see the mad t.v. on saturday where they made fun of britney spears? 
so you're, like dropping-
yeah. 
fuck you.
i just took the funniest picture of you. 
you're not gonna believe the face you made.  
there's a lot of pictures, i had no idea. 
 sorry, that one's a video. 
there. right there. you see that?  you're like  hmm? 
okay.  which bathroom? 
can you do me a favor?
i need thirty bucks.
the programmer guys they...they stole my wallet.
i don't know. eight days ago.
i haven't. 
easy. you go to delis with hot bars, and at the end of the day when they're about to throw them away you say you work for a shelter, they donate it to you, and then you just take-
thirty dollars, please!
ah, thank you so much. 
those pricks stole that picture of you. 
kay.
that's fair.
trust me, i can handle them, i just needed to-
can you send me an email just to see if it works? to my gmail?
yes, do send me the data! oo, the king requests the information to be sent to me, forthwith! quickly now!
quickly.
oo, before they see us.
oo, the prince comes! he comes and goes, he doesn't know what michelangelo knows.
oh! oh! oh!  a car! oo, what hark, the king requests me
drew the information upon your chest!
mm, don't you know
sorry.
you've changed, man. you've changed.
yup.
it's actually really sharp.
woah!  i usually don't spend so much money on myself, but...
it fit really well.
yeah, this is mine now.
nice, it's mine, though.
yeah, so, it's yours now.
until... until when is it yours, then?
right.
oh. when will, when, when will it be mine, now?
 if i can clear that chair, it's mine.
 ow! oh!
uh, at least pay me half of what i paid.
 you wonder how they make bubble wrap? ?
oh, hmm, let's see jake, uh...it couldn't possibly be plastic, so...?
uh, it would be ridiculous to think that they take plastic and they melt it down to a thin layer. oh that's in-that's insane, nobody could figure that out, who'd crack that mystery? h-how do they get the air in there? i don't know, do they...put it in? 
yeah, well, let's see, it resembles bamboo canes and that nodes are twen--
i'm looking at corn. how do you spell bubble wrap? ?
 ain't it weird when two boys do they just don't know something, so they look it up together, and they become best friends. you and i --?

it doesn't matter. ?
well now he respects me.?
that's 24 hours longer than he'll respect you, so. 
 i don't even know why we're making a big deal of this and not talking about what type of jeans you're wearing right now!! 
lol, you know what i hate??
paying at the pump. ?
and americans are doing it in record numbers. ?
what? like, instead of cash, you pay...you pump it, or whatever.?
diana, your cousin and my fiance.?
what?! what did she say to you? i'm not ready to be a dad!?
oh!  i don't know what th-i don't know what that means.  anyway, she's coming over soon for our hot date, and we may look very tired so don't mention anything, just ignore us. ?
ok, let me finish. we look tired because  we were up all night. 
 all night long. 
jake. we were basically all night holding each other. i'm her cuddle buddy, it's stupid. 
all right, now shut the fuck up, i think i hear her! remember, just to recap, we're in love and i don't steal coins from other people's desks.

why wouldn't she do it herself?
i can't believe this. i mean, you read plays, you see commercials, you never think it's going to happen to you.  ?
nobody should ever outlive a relationship with somebody else, especially her.?
can i be serious with you for a second? ?
i thought she was the one. 
i'm sure she was.
what do you mean?
the one, whatever. the one...well i don't know, you just say it. you just say it and the girl smiles and kisses you on the cheek... oh god this sucks!

whoa!  that was super scary. what happened? 
 whoa-oh!
we're fine!
just go back to sleep, please. 
why are you trying to embarrass me? 
no, we're not! 
you know it wouldn't surprise me if we were in here for the next three weeks.  
we should play a car game to pass the time. let's look for out of state license plates. . . . ow. 
is your g-chat going slow? mine's not working.
you said that earlier today. 
god, this is like that guy who was stuck in the elevator for 40 hours, only hopefully longer . . . what are you looking at? 
guys, we should all get tattoos of this experience so we don't forget it, i'll get the elevator, you get this homo.  
rations!
 i was hungry. sorry. somebody's not getting to lick the bag. 
i have to go! it's been like, forever!
it's just starting to dawn on me that we might not make it out of here alive.
we should all call our loved ones and say good-bye. 
pick it up! 
jake.  q-q quick question. i hope you don't mind that i mention that.
i don't know, you usually, like, cut me off or tell me to shut up after two lines so i don't plan my freestyles that long.
yes. i. do. what, you want me to come up with it off the top of my head?
you know, i think we talk to each other too much.
which is why, i've been working, like you told me to, on a secret code language that we can use. you know, just between us. that way we can talk to each other faster but just as much.
anyway, let's get started. l-g-s is let's get started so if i say that, that's what i mean.
and it just took me ten ms, relax.
oh, no no no.  m means day. so, it's, a little bit more convoluted than you thought.
you mean o-m-r.
jake.
yeah, you're right. i shouldn't change your name, it's perfect.
d-t?
yes. yes!
 too late, you promised, i'll meet you there. ah!
sorry i'm late
ok we're both sorry so... lets cancel each other out. relax i just had to ask you a question and it couldn't wait until i came over later to surprise you

alright. there are ten apples in a bucket and you reach in and take one out. how many apples are left in the bucket?
see i said eight. it's actually seven because the apples are so tight that when you  grab one out two fall out
you have  you have ten cookies in a jar or a bucket  and you take one 
yea exactly two
wrong i said six. it's actually two because they're the type of cookies that look like two cookies but they're actually conjoined at the waist like the chocolate chips... i mean this is so hard how are we supposed to figure this stuff out

this isn't supposed to happen, not until season two.
ace.
i don't wanna do this... but i've a real knife!
will ace ever come to his senses? is jocelyn really a double agent? 
will the evil, ugly scientist shut up and let me finish? all these answers and one more next week on ace and jocelyn, astronaut accountants from outer space. 
i mean, are you really going to tell me that you'd rather be at the yankee's game right now?
 i mean, i paid for half of that slice, so i don't even know why you're even--
okay, wow.  you're really going to be that petty about this, aren't you?
alright. i'm gonna leave. 
 alright, fine, i'll stay.
i know why you're pissed at me.
no, because you bought me this..  and we weren't even able to enjoy most of the game together.
okay! relax, you took money, and you bought it for me, i mean, what's the big--
ok, com'e on, compromise, right? meet me in the middle, and then--
alright. i'm gonna stop talking, if you talk to me for the rest of the day, and, you talk to me on thursday, friday--
awuwuwuwait okokokokok.  come on. i won't say anything. thanks for the hat, and that's it, or whatever.
jake! thank god i found you! that was epic! 
aight. good call, we'll split up, we'll cover more ground.
thanks for the hat. but, if we stay together, they won't expect it, and maybe, ill vote for that option because, i don't wanna be not near you right now, so. just a--..  just a tought! just a tought! 
alright, we're here at yankee stadium, jake got me this hat ,--
--and we're best friends, right? would you agree with that?

-like that. look, look at this.
i didn't know scissors could cut hair. what should i do?
this?
i'm gonna cut just a little.

i trust you.
it's so tough.
this seems like a lot.
i mean, look at this.
i don't care what you think. i care-
-right? 
i have one best friend. it feels like a little too short to me, but i'm gonna keep doing it because i respect you and know that you wouldn't knowingly hurt me. just like i've never knowingly hurt you.
done! boom.
god. stop hugging me from behind. people will start talking about that.
or..  ok
um, why should i answer your questions if you never answer any of the questions  that i, let me finish , ask you.
fine, i'll go first...
......do you wanna go first?
i don't know, you were just like hey, you look like shit, which i agreed with.

yes, she's a registered nurse. and my dad is like this toolbox-extraordinaire, it pains me to call him.
alright, perfect example. last day of college, right? he comes to pick me up in a u-haul. right of the bat, that's fucking nutso. but this guy honks the horn to get my attention. i freaked. i mean, tell me you understand.

yes.
 i wanna throw this hammer so that it hits right in between your eyes.
well, opposites attract, so, close your eyes.
i don't think i'm explaining it right.
it's not gonna hit your eyes  like either the left one or the right one, those are gonna be fine.
i feel like i'm doing the hard part by throwing it, and then you're not doing anything back, you know, like you're not bringing anything.
ok. but you can't convince me not to do this, i'm so set. like, i, it's already happened in my head.

ahhhh. all right, here's an impression. 
here's an impression of a normal guy.
you know what's a super neat invention? god, i don't know if it has a name but those luggages on wheels are the most convenient thing in the world. like, i graduated college three years ago, and i find myself travelling a lot more, just--the difference between holding one of these luggages and rolling them? it's night and day. it's absolutely night and day. and these airports are so expansive! i mean, have you been to the new airport in atlanta? terminal a's on one side of the city, i feel like i need an airplane to get to the other side of the airport. i mean, it's just absolutely obscene. and--you know i'm a jogger. i mean, i like to jog. but the problem isn't the jogging, it's--it's stopping, right when i stop, i'm feeling this--this  tightness in my arch and in my toes. and, you know, i go to the orthopedic surgeon and he's telling me it's plain orphochitis and i want a second recommendation, it's just unbelievable what kind of--and i am blabbing so much about myself and i cannot believe how self-centered i've been. we should get some coffee one time this week. what are you doing on thursday? i'm going to an opera or such, i don't know, some gay shit like that, it's just like a work in progress you know? i don't know...  here's a would you rather that's a freestyle! would you rather hump a moose, a big dead--
i knew you'd find me here.
y'know, not a day goes by that i don't think about your mother.
you were confirmed in a church like this. not much bigger than this actually.
she never even got to see you play lacrosse. how do you think that makes me feel.
allright fine, turn it off, okay?! and relax! there is an emergency!
i wanna shoot a chill-ass lip dub in here. just like a chill-ass lip dub in a church.
yeah it's like basically you lip sync a song and we put the music underneath, so it looks like you're singing.
whatever, in a thing, i don't know, but like, as i'm singing, like set fire to shit, and at the end it just goes pfff, and it explodes, so...
i don't know, a church blowing up. is that-it sounds like an emergency to me.
not only that, but you have to shoot it for me too. you have to be the one who shoots it because i'm the one who's singing, and then what are you gonna bring to the table.
ah, w-w-w-wait a second.
wait, c'mon, you said you'd shoot it, right?
okay, then say it now then, please.
c'mon, hey c'mon.
are you going to get gasoline? get diesel!
i'm comin' down now witcha, so, wait up for half a second--
 w- what is tha-? 
hey bro... 
 nooo, this is mine actually. where di-- you got one too? 
 yeah crazy.
 soulmates do dat shiat all the time.
the- this is weird.
i got it online. the internet. so.
 half of it is blue, you see that?
and then half of it... ah, my head hurts. heh.
 i was just about to spin it around when you said it--
 i know, ah, jesus! it started to get a little hot...
...when you said that. so.
 okay. good.
so we both have one, and, let's just leave it at that, at this point.  uh, i'll let you know when yours gets here. i'm gonna listen to music now.
 did you say something about us getting the same piece of equipment?
that was.. this is the.. it's just ended and now the- i was listening to rap--
i need you to help me register to vote.
well, vote or die right?
well i don't want it to be, which is why i'm going to put no, and then... 
ok, so, sheesh.
i do nay have a legal birthday, and i def do not have a  social security numbre comprende? so-e help-e on that-e.


i mean honestly i'm leaning towards voting for both.
michael both, the libertarian candidate.
i don't know, i don't know what i just said.
 i tink i am down to vote today.
ok cool cool,  tomonge it is!


i don't know, i'm like conflicted because one guy says the other guy is bad and then the other guy says the other person is bad so, like i think i'm just going to vote for the last person i hear talk.
 hey! don't touch my pen.
what's a blue state?
ok, so red state is nazi?

this is one vote that stays private!
he's a republican?!
if, we have to high five every home run, i know, and we have to create ten inside jokes, you don't have to tell me--

speak for yourself.  there's like $3,000 in here, do you know how much money i could buy with that?  shhh.
ahh!! 
hey man, you should stop drinking, i mean, that's not going to get sarah to want to have sex with you. although, when pat did it, it helped a lot--
you should've heard them the other night. they were all just like--
in change, though, so. you know i'm good for that.
i mean, didn't beating the shit out of pat make you feel any better? 
whoa, sleepover tonight?

whoa, sammy. 
wow, one week! sounds super stressful. plus we have my rap battle scene. 
whats that? 
yup. dan, who do you play on the collegehumor show? 
tell us a little bit about your character. 
well, sam told me that my character was just me, like im not supposed to exaggerate,  its just uh, who i am.  or whatever. 
yeah. 
w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-wait, i know--
were also losing light.
 ah, we dont need light!
ok.
i know. 
i kn--i know. 
shhhhh... 
uh, well be right back!
all right, we are here with sarah schneider, and she is an actress and a writetress on the show. 
yup.
yeah, which guys girl are you? 
spoiler alert!
yes, and everyone knows d.p. stands for  director of photography. so, yup. 
and he is--
hes in charge of the lightning on the set. so. 
yes. 
but whats--first question. whats the difference between thunder and lighting?
lets wake one of them up right now. 
streeter, streeter we want to interview--
n-n-no, you tell me what is it like ruining every single take you are in? sucking the life out of an otherwise great experience from everyone else?
you can cut. 
you can cut. you can cut. you can cut. you can cut. you can cut.  
its ok, hes ok, hes ok. 
have you ever been struck by lighting?
i mean just like straight up a lighting bolt just 
what? 
i hate it when you look at me like im stupid. 
lets go. 
weve already got another interview lined up with someone better. 
yes we do. 
so basically youre just the guy that holds the camera, right? 
vinny peone, a glorified human tripod.
yeeyuuhh.
 i figure we, do five minutes of freestyle, and make it off top of my dome, and i--
no..
well, when you put me on the spot, it's like--
ok.
 yo. your beat is crummy and i can't rap to it,  it sucks so, it's over, yo.  so. i don't know.
well.. yeah, you can't give me-- you- you gave me no tools, and you were expecting me to build--
okay, fine.
oh, you guys are having your international convention, and the theme is the future is now!
yeah..--
if the future's now, then what's tomorrow?
new theme--is it too late to bring it up?
ok.
the- history is now! that way, it's a little more believable because--
ok, the future. you do a three p- and then the fut- and then the present, is- yeah. you just rotate all three. i dunno. use it if you want, or if you don't, whateva. just like--
ok.
alright, this is why that doesn't make sense.
let's say it's just- you're just one person. can you do anything..
--no. okay. what?
not alone; you have to be able to get.. at least ten thousand people to do it with you, right?
how do you..---
what if you're in a car? all of a sudden, you're not making many steps, right?  you have to always- so we're telling you, out-think the chinese proverbs, because,  yes, they're smart, but, we can be better than that. and it takes.. just one person, to make it--
we can be better than the chinese. is that what you want to say?--
what? that's- when you say it like that it's mean, and that's not what i meant. we can be just as good as they are.
not at math!
and don't just use this weekend to hook up with other people ; you're to young to kiss, anyway.
what?
fresh- what? i was--
nah. i mean i was twenty-five, and i knew that that was--
yes. w--
it hasn't happened yet.

well, i'm almost done, i'm up to 3 random things about me.
28 to go.
 i'm coming.
what's up?  i left your door unlocked.
are you mad at me?
is it in spanish? 
 so, it's not.
leaving what?
if you're gonna call me in here for a practical joke, make sure it's at least funny.
i know what you're trying to do, and it's not funny anymore.
when do we start?
ouch.
so, have fun, and good luck. 
  you know what?  what if i don't do the high-pitched voice anymore?  then, will you stay?
 this'll be the last time.  this'll be the last time.   jake, this will-
-be the last time.
 you don't have to sit across from me anymore.  
we'll go talk to ricky.  you don't have to sit across from me anymore, i know you hate that.
  then, stay...stay...
no!
two more...
...and the stairs.
you guys know that you could be watching porn right now?
whatever.
alright, don't tell me what to do!
what, you're gonna take his side?
whoa. you had a partner? that's awesome!
yeah i had a bf, jake. well, he was more of a bbf. and then he moved to california.
nah, california. hey! we should be partners!
whoa ... don't touch me here, heh!
no i'm not out, i'm in. and so are you! we're both in. god, you're so dumb.
ah! stop, no! get away from me! we already tickle fought like five times earlier today, remember? i told you it's not fun when you let me win.
and likewise, it's an honor for you guys to be with us, right?
uh, the beatles, uh beastie boys, uh busta rhymes... what do these guys have in common? it's...
...four.
the-- four. they all had four different people. you guys have three.
which is close. like, how do you guys envision getting to that next, the fourth person, and--
the beatles,
the busta rhymes, and the beastie boys.
what would i need to do to throw my name into that mix, like what would you need to know about me?
sure.
like more than i already am?
you went on vacation?
i'm interested in freestyle rap battling one of you guys. is that-- do you think that's doable?
okay
i could do both.
 yo, nice blue jacket, mofo, ey, it's not time to wear that no mo, it's like 1999 up in this house, your glasses are whack and you not wearing any.  so let's switch.
that was a bit out of beat.
ok.
 yo, whatchu talkin about our jacket, mc, that's not how it is, that's not how it be,--
yeah jorm, you understand that you're sittin next to my.. old.. best friend--
ok. ahh shee--
yeah.
 five o'clock in the morning, i hear the phone ringing 
whaddup son, sorry boy you sleeping?
 just finished reading this ill-ass novel...
 family up in-- a little louder. cuz i dunno, like--
yeah.
ok, so.
okay.
so that's one. and then if i'm in that's two. so, it's like fifty-fifty at this point.
down the road, i join the group.
whatever, ok, that.. becomes a thing.
let's say i start feuding with jorm over here.
we start fighting, it's obviously, it's not gonna happen with me and jorm. we kick jorm out...
we're down to three again, which is fine...
we needed a fourth, but we realized four might have been too many, once i joined the group.
my question is, do we still need that fourth? and if so...  my guy right here.
ok
sure.
ok.
 oh my god, i am so so sorry we gotta wrap things up, right? cuz we have-- we're getting like lots of people coming in and out all the time.
 byebye.
huge dicks, right?
that's a bit of an understatement, don't you think?
what?! god, no. why?
ok, i'm not going to stand here and listen to you talk smack behind his back.
yes, sarah, it is. gay means bad, like if i wanted to insult your shoes and they were bad or whatever i'd be like hey, you have 
i know. what does that mean?
so you think mike's a woman? trust me, he's not.
oh hey mike. i was just leaving.
sure, meet you in the men's room.
for sure.
hey jake, it's amir, i hope you don't mind, i put this song on your ipod. it's about your name so... j is jake and a is for 
this next one's like a hard core rap song, so maybe turn down your ipod. yow! motherfu
nope, you ruined it.
hey mike, can i talk to you about something?
sarahs trying to start a rumor that you're gay...
yeah! i didn't know what that meant either. i guess gay has an alternate definition where like even though you're not a woman, right?
right, so even though you're not a woman you still want to have sex with me?
alright, so now i am confused. you are a woman?
to be my friend?
what?
i thought we were partners..
yeah?
so?
 is that what that was?
so we're not best friends.
shhhh!
okay..relax.


 so?

i've been crunching the numbers, jake.
 why can't you just say that's impressive?
dun, dun, dun! dramatic chipmunk.

he's good. i like him just fine, i was just.. once you think about it you start to like him more and then i started to think about him and nowillowillike him.
it tastes like a mouth.. it's like a mouthfull of buttholes in my mouth. it tastes like acid.
i think it tastes like delicious acid.
yeah, i think it tastes like delicious ass, is what i meant.
i said acid but i meant--yeah in a bad way, an awful way--i mean, can you-- for crying out loudly, can you stop?!
you keep like chan- i dunno you're like a flip-flopper and then i can't decide what i like, because you're always all over the place.
yes.

i'm sorry, i have to text my parents.
oh you're right, you're right, you're right, you're right, you're right! i'm soory, i'm just thinking like a mile a minute now.
oh this is so exciting. but do you actually know what's gonna be more exciting?
oh god, i'm thinking about a male stripper giving blowjob lessons, can you imagine that?
oh my god. she has to plan. does she know where? does she even have a date?  does she even have a bleep date?!
yeah, just oh my gosh! the thought of her having like sex with only one person for the rest of her life. uuuh i just, i guess this is what they call cold feet right?
i donno, it's just like everything's one way and then all of a sudden 1 question later, everything's just shwosh, the complete opposite.
she wants a divorce. oh my god, she wants a divorce!
ok, this is weird for her alright. you don't have to make it worse!
she's made a mistake.
and jakes phone number is 2-1-0-3-
 no.
oh! by the way did you see what jake was wearing today?
uh, i don't know what that is but it was a sweater with buttons going down.
why did you say it then?
we'll stop being a educated quest and started being a...so.
only if jake says no to me.
duper.
super duper 
hey, i should do that with jake, remind me?
my parents will drive us if your parents will pick us up.
 oh yeah i forgot.
 they died in a plane crash

when you have ab est friend and he never wants to hang out with you.
i have jake.

no! and only talk to me through the headset!
hey, hey jake when i say 'super' you say-
no sam stfu.
hi, you're watching jake and quincy.
i'm jake.
hey pat you're a dummy ass, so. did you hear that?
mean to him? i was insulting him.
yeah, definitely, yes, of course!
we're all basically on a level playing field, right? so i make people feel worse about themselves, suddenly 'hey, this is pretty neat, i'm like a good guy all of a sudden' i feel better about myself when i put other people down. it like masks my insecurities.
 dinner tonight?
can't, either, me neither., so...jake and now you ask me why.
good question.
i'm doing the master's cleanse.
 no no, that's the master's cleanse.
yeah. i'm doing the master's master cleanse. which is nothing. no food, no water, for masters, by masters, four masters.
 no, no, no, no, no. sorry. two weeks.
yes, correct.
yes.
yes.
i've been eating unhealthy, right, for like ever, always. yeah forever. yeah yeah.  so like, now i don't eat anything for 21 days.
 right. and all of a sudden, hey! i'm in ship shape now, i'm completely healthy,  i'm cleansed. and i can re-introduce all the bad stuff that i've been eating, only make it worse. suddenly my options are more limitless, like i can have bacon fat, or butter fat, or carrot sticks dipped in milk,  dipped-
ok.
keep on hating, j. witz, because what you say strengthens my resolve. thanks for making me a fighter.
nah.
i was starving!
and you don't have to call me out on it.
jake, do you want a chip?
what?
 that depends. are you impressed?
ok, so no. i don't know-i don't know what a youtube thing is. 
that's weird. 
'cause i just failed a gallon challenge yesterday. my cousin leron was filming it. what are the odds of that?!
this is funny, right?
ok.
i know! that's why i'm going to delete it right now.
oh. ok, so what should i do?

he doesn't have any money? 
insanely good business idea? 
ok. that's my idea, bitch!
but you said it was insanely good?
my brother? 
your brother?
jake, i don't think kumail is the trustworthy guy you think he is. 
yes, that. and yesterday when you were in the bathroom, he was like digging around, looking for pay stubs or whatever.
yeah, so . . . 
yes, but have i ever lied to you?
ok, shut up!

ah, wrong video, wrong video.
how are you enjoying the silent treatment, jakey?
well, that'll be the last time today, so...  sarah, will you let jake know that this is gonna be the last time that i'm gonna talk to him today?
sarah, now will you tell jake that i'm interested in hearing what he did last night, who he ate dinner with, what he had for dinner, who he was with, why he wasn't at home, or et certa.
okay, i didn't say that, jake.
ah! sarah, okay, uh, tell jake that you were kidding earlier when you were talking about me not knowing how to say stuff.
ha! in your dreams, bitch.  err, sorry, tell jake that i said, ha, in your dreams, bitch, and then let me know what he says... let me know if he laughs or whatever.
whoa, that's weird; sarah, is a window open? because i just heard a draft.  sarah.
okay!  silent treatment on sarbear then.  jake, will you ask sarah if she heard a draft?

hey, babe. 
wow, you're not my mom! so...dinner tonight?
you just shut the f-f-front door...sorry. dinner tonight?
ok, just tell me which mcdonald's we're going to and keep in mind that three of them won't have me back so to speak, and you know that! 
oh, i've been there.  that's that place where they have that thing where if you cuss at your waitresses you get free drinks. 
yes it is. 
yeah, i mean, it's not like this special deal that they advertise, it's like this special audio coupon that you can cash in. i'm surprised you didn't know that.
i mean, it's not like this physical coupon or whatever. it's like the same thing about like when you go to a restaurant and you order something that they don't have on the menu but they'll still give it to you, if you openly weep and you like throw a fit. 
yeah, like a tempa-tension. 
no, you can't do it often! you can only do it once at every restaurant in the city. i mean, do you really not know that? 
nah, don't feel bad. i mean, these ones are tame compared to the ones my cousin leron cashes in.   he cashed in this one coupon -- 
i'd do it a lot more, if i wasn't so afraid of smelling, tasting, seeing waitress blood and stuff like that.
sorry about that, babe.
there he-i is!
why? it's not president's day, is it?
oh, bro! whoa, why? i don't know though, bro. what?
i went to blockbuster, i rented n64 and snowboard kids, why? do you want to come over or something?
no.

ah.
yeah! i think so. this is awesome! 
yeah, definitely. why? how much though?
yeah! i knew that! i could drink more than that. 
oh yeah, we had the gymnastics.
yeah, they call me the gym guzzler, yo. 
ok. 
oh. 
 yeah.
sure. 
ugh!
i do, uh, yeah.
stupid b. 
 no! 
 hey, man! no, no, no.
ok, i only have a twenty. but why don't you take it, and you don't tell anybody about last night, twice. 
you're going to cab it. 
gimme a j!
okay, i was spelling my name.
ah.
 hey dude, don't make it brr! 
i'm just settling this area, making sure that everything is like... under... control...
 huh?
sorry?
ooooh, yeah! 
have you ever heard of ebay?
it's like an electronic bay...
no. well, i tried to. def tried to. tried to get some big players, big things, lots of bucks. almost sold your computer for 10k. 


well, at first i didn't sell it, true. but then, lowered the price, you know.  sans reserve, 
oh yeah yeah, i meant like, the prices were so low i was practically giving them away. so it was like... it was like a steal, you 
sure, stole it and sold it brotha, i mean it's highway robbery, you know? what are we even arguing about anymore? i can't even 
 alright, problem-o solved-o!
alright, will you just go through your day like you normally would and then, if you happen to stumble upon a problem we'll take 
alright, right off the bat you usually get some water before you turn your computer on, so it doesn't look like you're stumbling 


 we're in the clear! 
 no way he's believing that. 
 no way. 


so then i'll all like, 'all right, everybody, hit the flippin' gr-floor.' and it's just's like  ahhhhhh!
 what's on it-what's on my--
impossible.
well, it was very, very, very difficult.
not yet. trust me. 
ok-ok-ok-ok-ok. 
i know, i know, i just, whatever it is, i'll take it, you know?
like you didn't know. 
basically, i thought i'd come in here, everybody would start losing their sheesh once they realized it's my halfie, and then instead of quelling them down 'cause everyone is so loud and stuff, i'd just remove my shirt and the message is displayed. 
well, i know. that's why i got leron to write on my back, 'thanks again everybody, sorry for making a scene but this is an office so let's all relax.'
what do you mean?
yeah! but everything was all backwards so it was difficult to read. 
i know,  i thought it was a letter.
then i thought it was a letter. 
i'm going to f***ing kill leron if there's an arrow on my back, i swear. 
he's done, simple as that. it's over. 
your hair looks amazing.
oh, by the dubs, you're coming over tonight, cuz i rented kate  leopold.

 nothing you want to confide in me? nothing you want to confide in me?
'cause kid you know you can tell me anything, kid. you know that, kid?
especially secrets.
yeah, so like for example, like a secret would be if you got a disease or whatever and you didn't want anybody to know but me, that would be an example of a secret that you could tell me.
okay, jake, come on i know you got the t-shirt virus man i'm sorry but you know you can trust me i won't tell anyone!
also, i checked you're email, and that is totally messed up, i shouldn't have done that but, if you think about it, the ends justified the means, bro, and this just a classic case of that --
 yeah right. honestly, i wish i could believe you, but the doctor, doctor poop that wrote you that email, he straight up said that one of the symptoms was lying. to me, specifically. so, i don't know what to do write now.
ha! so you mean to tell me that if i stand up, take off my shirt and yell that "i'm a huge pervert, i'm a pedophile and a pervert" that doesn't help cure you're little disease?
 i know, ha, i was... just checking.  um... i knew that you knew that i was reading you're email, so... that was me messing with you.
huh?
ahh
cool. so like all that stuff you bought on amazon, all that weird sex stuff, that was just part of you messing around with me?
that makes a lot... like why would you buy self --
so funny...
 hey guys --!
hi you're quatching jake and amir.

ah, that's true. i'd have to quit that job to work here, nevermind, so--
ah, you're right, why would i leave--
 you've got a fast jake, let's get tickets to a baseball game. i wanna eat chicken nuggets, you gotta pay 'cause i don't have cash. anything is better, than me paying 'cause i don't have cash. i was pretty  clear about that, when i said i didn't have cash. you're ee-aaah...
 wait jake jake jake jake! can you buy these for me? i am strapped--  ahh!-- for cash!
i don't have cash on me. i wish i had cash and i don't have cash and i'm

yeah, so, when you're done with them, throw them on this hamper. oh!
it's four days! it's four- how long do you go without brushing your teeth?

why not?! hey, we're the same size!
all right, we just tweeted 'across some tennis courts on carrie and lyndon'.
oh my god, is that them?
is it?
oh my gosh, that was so quick.

sorry, i'm hearing a lot--i'm hearing some yes's and some no's. 
 yes, maybe, maybe. 
i'm going to go say something.

caryons or colored pencils?
what?
favorite los angeles ram, in order
i wanna die, no please
what's it like to be on a team with such a losing record? does it 
i can't breath
cuz you're, a lot of people think that you're the worst player on the worst team.
i'm gonna die
because you can't, can't block and you can't catch. and those are pretty much two big pieces of the puzzle right there
ow 
i feel like, ok, let's talk about your life. you do a lot of great great stuff off the field but i feel like sometimes you embarrass your family and friends by taking naked pictures of yourself and putting them on the internet! i'm sorry everyone was talking about it
muffled screams
you know, oh it's great that your here. i wanted to ask you what 
so,you pumped about mike shanahan coming in or?
w-wait, i have a few video ideas. 
yeah, but that's because brainstorming is not about listening.
all right, listen up! we reanimate the little mermaid.
in 2d.
in 1d then. huh? 
all right, the voice actor who plays tony the tiger thinks everything is 'grrreat'!
yeah, it went over pretty well. didn't it?
bitch! 
 it's a commercial for yogurt.
you're the joke, if you don't like this rich yogurt.  i don't like it. 
few song parody ideas.  they tried to make me sign on g-chat and i said yo, yo, yo.  i've got an orange, fruit, that tonight's going to be a good night. 
all right, it's a frat house, but it's in 3900 b.c., what?!
no, mine takes place in rome and that's completely non-negotiable. so. 
wow. i'm bleeding.
what if roosters had watches? haha, i think it would go a little something like this: clock-a-doodle-doooo.  swing and a miss from blumenfeld. ha. get off the stage butt-head. nah, that was a good idea. 
you know how sometimes people just forget how to eat? 
ok. 
all right, one more, and jake is already on board with this one in a major way.  
well, you haven't even heard it yet.
la-la-oh-la-la. ro-ma-ro-ma-ma. ga-ga-oh-la-la, want your good orange.

was it? yeah. so, you missed my backflip then?
uh, so murph just--

well you never know right?
alright, this is what we're gonna do. i'm gonna cough in your mouth, if you're not sick in two days, i was right. if you are sick in two days we'll chalk that up to being a weird coincidence and we'll call it a draw

if you killed my dog, you know you-
so why are you apologizing hm? why are you... what are you sorry about?
whoah whoah, what'd you say? you're sorry that a wolf ate-
that a wolf ate your dog
i never said that a wolf ate my dog! huh?
did i?
yeah, right. right, yeah dang it. you have to admit that would have been pretty clever though if i caught you like that
so you admit it!
yeah i'm like 50/50 on it
alright okay fine! i don't have a dog okay? i just wanted to catch you in a lie
i just... you always catch me in lies i thought i'd catch you in one
oh wow! big whoop!
yeah, dang it
i know that's the point!
jake and amir watching you are.
chewy, actually.
snowstorms right? i remember as a kid, i used to play outside during a snowstorm on my front lawn, trying to spell s.o.s with my tracks. i don't know why. what was i trying to be saved from? those were the best days of my life.
when it's this much, you can't even tell if it's falling down or going up-
everywhere, it's white on white, it's pure, it's beautiful. there is no direction, it just, is.
it's funny how winter kind of sneaks up on you, you know? every year i'm surprised again for the first time.
i guess life is about being spontaneous.
look how beautiful it is outside. i'm already in jail.
in a couple of years we're going to look back on this day and realize, this was the day that the cops came and i hid behind the copy machine and you covered for me even though you didn't want to.
it was our word against rosie's. he didn't stand a chance. our friendship was solidified by the risk you were willing to take for me.
you said you weren't going to cover for me but deep down inside, you knew that you had to.
at the end of the day, i had some shit on you that the police couldn't find out about and if they did, you'd be the one sitting next to me in that jail cell.
march 15, 1999 you-


hey! you're watching jake and amir!
likewise!
help!
sorry, almost lost my cool there for a second.
filling out your march madness bracket?
i don't know why, it's just a hallmark holiday right? perpetrated by the grating card business to sell 
do you want this chocolate bunny or not?
a long shot to win the whole thing, hmm. don't mind if i per-due!
wow.. that was awful. 
hey, how do you spell 'hoops'?

a sixteen has never beaten a one, yet when i was sixteen... i beat plenty of ones.
one-year olds, that is.
it's just that comedy is tragedy plus time and your comedy is just tragedy, it stinks, it's bad, it's awful 
well, you're not rootin' for kansas anymore, toto.

hey craig, you're watching jake and amir.
yeah, and people who are not named craig.
jake. i figured out a way to save time.
by wiping before you shit?
how does what save you any time?
 how does what save you any time, though? how does what,  save you any time, that is.
it does.
and i'm telling you that it is, a time saver.
and i believe you, that you believe me, that is, because it is.
ya just do it! you wipe, and then you shit.
you don't have to because it does.
ok!
hm hm!
 yeah!
 yep!
 we can agree to agree because it does! ahh!
 it is fine, because it does.
i am never wrong sometimes.
yes but if you switch the order it makes it so time is saved so, ahh! 
 yes i do.
ok
it is ok because it does save time.
 it is ok because it does save time, it is ok because it does save time.
 yes it does, yes it does.
 yes it does it does save time, yes it does it does save time.  yes it does it does save time!
ahhh
i can't breathe!
let go! all i'm saying is that if you wipe before you shit there's not a lot of shit there so you don't have to wipe as much! that's it! it's a time saver!
that's it, yeah.
because it saves time.
 what doesn't make sense?
gahhh
wow, you are trying way too hard.
now, question, and it's an important one so think wisely
 that sucks... right?
sucks so hard. ...doesn't it? ..sucks so badly, doesn't it?
...sucks so bad and hard
i'm not gonna sit here and tell you that it doesn't suck, okay?
i'm not gonna sit here and watch you cry about it, 'cause that's not gonna help
yeah, you're not crying yet, but once the tears flow, how is that gonna save everything?
telltell me how the tears will help , and i'll let you flow i'll let them flow out.. onto my shoulder.
 oh my god, my filesi left my files home; it was so important
 oh, but now my day's ruined, and i have to eat cat food, and i don't know what to do because i don't like the dry ones, it's too crisy, and the wet ones are too soggy so i have to mix it together, but it still tastes too salty to eat.  why?!  oh, damn it...
uh, yeah. of course.  look at me.  look at me. hey! look at me. look at me.
things are gonna be fine, okay?
okay. if this is the worst thing that happened to you today... 
guess what? you have a very blessed life.
'cause that means you're not gonna die today. ...so, pretty good
okay.

i'm talking about 2031-
l is for the way you look- 
at me! 
o- what do you mean what am i doing, isn't it obvious? i'm showing you up. 
it's- it's a song. which is like poetry, except it's not gay, 'cause you sing it. 
kay, so... 
that was bad. 
aura. 
u should be for uninspired, or unapologetically underwhelming. you should go back to poetry school. 
what about... 
unrelenting. 
unrelenting. 
really? 
yeah, that's close enough. i'm sure she'd appreciate that. 
again. 
arms again... 
i think she has two, but- 
go for it then. 
because it's gonna be good when you say it twice. 
yeah, i'm sure she loves you whether you say arms twice. 
jake also got you a gift card for $100 to a spa. 
so... 
no probs. 
i didn't get her anything, because mother's day is a hallmark holiday. so... 
it is also her birthday, yes. 
two hallmark holidays for the price of one. free!  
'cause i ain't spendin' anythin'!  can i get that card back, actually, because it's also her anniversary-

they don't know that!
 oh! here we go! 
boom, baby!

ok, you've been acting like a real bitch ever since that kick, did i say something to you? or do something?
that's not a phrase, ok? nobody's talking to you!
jake, wait!  ok your sunglasses look ridiculous and stupid! they look really dumb!
 na na naaa na..... na na naaa na.....
 haha, mondays!
whatever.
and
really? i though there was one more
okay just give me that cube already ok it's so frustrating watching you try to solve it.
i could solve any cube: rubik's cube . . .  . . . etcetera
only if you want me to solve the rubik's cube that depends on whether  . . . ow!
this really kills
okay you threw this on purpose!
you admit it
alright i'm throwing this back at your face alright. oh, do i have a bump?
here give me your hand. do you feel this? do you feel this? 
do you feel this?
well ya i feel it ok. i'm throwing this dumb thing back at your face right now.
it wouldn't make me feel better, it would make you feel worse
oh. oh. oh. oh. oh. oh. oh. oh. oh. ya. ya. ya. ya. ya. ya.
you're scared right, now you know how i felt
oh bull spit, i saw it coming at me, on me, or in me
ok, ha, we are homies again
ha ha  ha, oh my gosh that didn't even hurt at all
and no catching, i didn't catch it!
for all of us here at jake and amir, happy holidays
whateva
uhhhhhh what book are you reading?
no shit, that's why i asked what you were reading.
okay what?
tell me about it. no news is good new though.
yeah that's why... it proves my point.
what's the big deal, just stuff it with garbage, that's what i would do.
yeah... disappointing for me? err...
for the wolf.
i think the scariest thing isn't the rate at which the oil is spilling but rather spiders! okay those things are freaky for real.
"yeah" you agree or "yeah" you're just getting me to shut up?
if you could change one thing about the oil spill what would it be...
...and why? hmm, little harder than you thought.
soil, foil, susan boyle.
noil
drill baby drill huh, more like kill baby krill.
if only krill was a word.
yeah forget it. forget it, it's got it, it's gone.
there's this episode of saved by the bell where uh...
no the one where zach impersonates a russian chess player from valley and let's screech beat him.
cuz it's funny!
as sad as this whole oil spill thing is, it might be like the one catalyst that sort of springs us and the world in general to sort of think about alternative energy sources going forward.
yeah... i'm just kidding you idiot! haha you carfucker i got you! yeah how about an automobile that runs on ocean water so that when the ocean water spills into the ocean nobody gives a crap? how about...
you know this whole thing wouldn't be an issue if oil was more dense than water, like i suggested!
ah no no no kay kay kay, here we go. how about an automobile that's run on stupid ideas so we can just hook a pump to your ass and you can fart out these shitty ill-conceived notions for the rest of time and we can just power every car in america for the next thirty years. how 'bout that! or, what about, thinking solar for once.
hey, thanks for coming.
yeah, what's the speed limit?
ok, i got a little wiggle room. 
well they were super cheap. i guess no one wants to see the reds play.  
 not quite at yankee stadium, the game is in cincinnati. 
da-nati. 
the nati, shasta macnati. what's up?
we're almost there, relax! 
we're not - . the game is not in two hours, check the date, it's in 26 hours, idiot. ok, so we're barely going to miss it.
yeah, a little bit, but what's the big deal when you got  the overbeck pottery museum! 
yeah, well you're wrong, again, because it's not in either; it's in cambridge city, indiana, which sounds far away but it's actually only a six hour drive from cincinnati, which means road trip #2!
that's fine. you're just being a little bit of a buzz kill right now but what you need is a high level of the tickle monster! 
 oh my god! 
n-n-n-n-no. i know what you're trying to do, you're trying to get me to let go of the steering wheel. it's not  gonna happen, ok? i don't trust you. 
do you? ok, let's stop right here then. 
 but i hope you realize that this move, this little switch, makes me the dj of this party-mobile. that's right, all party tunes, all the time. me and you, haha, ok, uh...
 j.k., it's me, uh,  you're an idiot. look to your right, man.  you are going to realize that i am not there. 
hey, you're watching goodwill hunting, starring denzel washington.
aaaaaahhhwwwwazzaapp?
 nah. i'm good.
so yeah, i can see why you'd think that, based on all this .
door is open because i um... ... alright fine i was asleep, ok you caught me!
jake, ok, i'm sorry, it's too early for this.
yes, well the door is open because i fell asleep before i got a chance to close it, ok?
yeah, it was going to be, but i  zonked out.
 ya caught me again. you bastard! hahaha, you're on today! 
oh, no, the treats.
yes, that's because it's better to ask for forgiveness, than for permission.
ok. just wipe me and we can go, please.
yes, please wet the toilet paper--
hey, you're watching jake and amir!
--biiitch!
same.
same same.
same same thing that you jokesters are laughing about.
 oh my jee!
hey, i'd give pat a candy bar but he'd just eat it!  ..no, i'm just messin' with you guys. 
ww- pat! i saw pat eating a sandwich yesterday. lettuce, cheese, tomato-- everything. and what he didn't finish, he just threw away.  what's the matter pat, ain't you ever heard of leftovers for dinner? 
whatever, it's all the same, right, tubby?
..no.
at the restaurant, maybe. 
oh my god, this guy's too fat to even realize he's admitting it!  pat farted!  no...
what? smelled bad maybe.
yeah, smelled like food,  'cuz that's what this guy had.. for breakfast. gobble, gobble .
i know. i'm messing with you, maan.
no.
..so.
 um. um. no... so.
c'mon! i was messing with him!													
wow, you're so good. why don't you just do all the intros without me?
no!
uh, it's not a toy; it's a 3d puzzle game. yeah...
show you?
oh, teach you how to solve the cube?
uh... how to.. solve it.
um... i will. okay, so basically, it's simple. the first step is
right. i guess so. uh, you don't know how to do it, though, so...
weller. okay, uh, so the first step is to do the entire front face the same, so right now
okay ... uh, yeah. so, well, then it's not called blocks; it's called cubes.
uh... right, so, uh, there are algorithms in play, so you wanna
i didn't say you didn't know what algorithms were.
um, they're ways to move the cube so that you don't mess up what you already have, so right now
...right. so this one's called right inverted, down inverted, right, down.
right, well, we're getting close, so just pay attention.
whoa.
done! hehe.
oh yeah! i'm fine.
what are you doing, and don't say pooing.  i'm a poet and i didn't even know that i was one of them.
private, answer the captain's question!
oooh, very good, but a little too late.
yes. oh, 2010 world cup.

stop yelling about it!
why don't you be a little more loud about it, ok? i don't think everybody on the third floor heard you.

aha, jake has spain going to the bathroom!
oh, fuck me, jake, you have to help me out. cmon' they're onto us!

jake, you can't see me like this.
jake, i am naked!
i'm not embarrassed, ok? it's just supposed to be a surprise.
what the heck is that?!
no, no. you said i could pose like that for inspiration, but the actual masterpiece would be of me and jake on a tandem bike or a skateboard.
have mercy.
no, my plan was to auction off the painting and split the money with you, 80-20 huh. now i'm starting to have serious doubts. well, not serious doubts but im starting to...
i got ten dollars.
a hundred dollars.
hundred fifty
two hundred
two fifty.

i don't know what you're complaining about, ok? i'm gonna take us to dinner with the money that we made.
correction.
you just corrected me.




sorry i freaked out
that's it
babe .  .  .  baaaabe.
i'm not.  did you get the letter i sent you, babe?
i did. i did send you a letter, and let me know when you get it because there's a couple things that i want to clarify.  firstly, in the opening paragraph--
ok, just let me know when you do because i left some things intentionally ambiguous. 
so that i could clarify them later. oooh!
please do. please do-do.  please do-do, but not in my tea, or in my coffee! haha, no. 
oh. you'll get the letter.
ok, i don't want to argue with you anymore about this stupid letter!
ok, you're going to get it, and we're going to laugh. and we're going to laugh and we're going to crack up when you read it. 
which you will.
ok, forget it. i'm going to change the subject.  what do you think is in the letter?
 because before we were talking about whether or not you would get it and now we're talking about the contents of the letter. 
yeah, well i'm not going to not talk about the letter, i want to talk about the letter!
you didn't get the letter.
because i never sent a letter!
you placate me too often.  i address that in the letter.   somewhat ambiguously, but i would clarify it later.  any odds you already got it? 
eating lunch; is that okay? or is it not lunchtime yet?
oh...
crabs, lobster, shrimp, anything with a shell.
turtles also have shells.
that's how she said. 
a how-she says what?
you're a how-she.
from a guy in front of our building.
no, i bought crabs from, like, a guy in a truck?
like a pickup truck?
no! i bought crabs with money!
okay, well, it's still alive!
what, you want me to eat these alone outside?  oh no!
yeah, and tuck the crabs into your pants, okay? i want these babies back dead or alive! preferably both.

whoa, what's that?
don't mind if i do. 
 whoa, what's in this?

walnuts!  eggs, yeast, flower, milk, muffins.
peas
i can't spit it out, ok! my throat's closing! why did you give this to me?
 well that's an apple walnut computer, you don't see me eating that.
i just realised i'm gonna die. i'm gonna die because of the muffin because of you; there's gonna be blood on your hands!
i'm gonna die just like that president did.
 fun fact, millard fillmore.


my throat's closing, i can't spit it out!


have you seen the new facebook redesign? it's really whack; it's so bad.
yeah, the way they do it is like really little, small, subtle changes so you don't notice it but i notice it. i think i'm gonna start a group that's called like, 1 million strong or 10 million strong against... well i haven't figured out the name of the group yet but it's definitely gonna be something like...   ah!
so no hey?
you're a dick.
hey, do you have a minute?
 i'm pregnant!

yeah, i had my doubts.
mmhmm, but i'm fairly confident that i'm now with child.
backaches.
headaches.
tender breasts.
very!  ow!
then how do you explain my morning sickness?
65 chicken nugget skins and an industrial size tin of expired ketchup that leron found from an abandoned wendy's.
 wait, let me finish! also some expired yoghurt, expired eggs...
and something leron calls, satan's freckles, which is just stale wheat toast made moist in the middle by the tears that come out my eyes from when he tickles me too much.
i took a pregnancy test and i passed.
 ohhhhh! 
 plus, negative. i'm have a baby.
uhh, yes, i did.
you think i just stood in the middle of a pharmacy and peed on a box and then they made me buy the box because they saw me pee on it?
 ow! my tender breasts!
one hundred thousand facebook fans! w
yeah, well, you were kind of in it before. i just wanted to.. spend some time thanking each and every one of you, one at a time.
joseph ableit was supposed to be five minutes, giving a little personal message to everyone of them.
how long would that possibly take?
okay, what, you don't have timeooh, do you think you're gonna die in the next year, that you don't have time?
do you think you're gonna die?

okay. well-- don't go anywhere, 'cuz i need a witness!
well i need a witness!
okay. uh, i'm amir blumenfeld, and this is my... certified... emergency medical assistant--
--it's fine-- jake hurwitz. uh, and, i'm gonna be trying to break the world record for longest time holding your breath.
rrrrrrgh. okay. uh, this is a verbal agreement, because we both understand... the inherent risk involved in this stunt, and we both agree to pay... twenty-five hundred dollars to the guinness book of world records if this video is fraudulent. i agree. do you agree? just say yes.
well what the fu--
i agree. do you agree?
 let's get started.
okay, fine. i agree to pay the whole thing. let's just-- do this; you're messing me up.
alright. this is attempt number one.
alright, cut.
longest holding-of-breath, attempt number one.
just-- okay. it's just a little more impressive if i do it in one! right? it's so obvious that that's what i was tr--
attempt number one.
what the hell was that?
you're a f**king narc.
okay, attempt number one.
because you said something!
so... cut.  which one?
okay, attempt number one.
rrrrgh.
we can always ed--... th-- edit that part out.
because i'm trying to-- make it impressive; i wanna get in the book.
...okay. no cheating.
start.
cut it!
aaaah, i browned out!
i browned out, but i survived! how long was that?
 gahhhhhhh...
i browned out!
hey, wait, why is that red light on?
yeah.
...you recorded it, right?
you did get it, though?
okay, good. i trust y--
ohhh, ohhhhhh...
 dear mister blumenfeld, thank you very much for your submission, we regret to inform you, though,  that this is a fine. ohhhh no,  jake, we got the f-- we got the fine...
check your e-mail.
check it again then.
huh, my e-mail always gets sent after just one line.
any ideas on how to fix that?
don't i know it. pay to play.
so laptops aren't plugged into anything, and they send e-mails quite fine.
oh my god, everyone, your laptops aren't plugged into anything, i hope wireless routers exist and can send packets of information over the airwaves using i-triple e 802.11 technology standards.  or is that impopsicle?   
impopsicle. it's frozen. how stupid you are.
you're an asshole! you're mean to me!  check your e-mail! 
if you have to ask . . . then you don't know. 
it's just this e-mail, congratulating you for being you. so. 
now i wish i never sent it. 
well now i feel like a stupid because the e-mail is in the aether and it just never arrived to you. 
and now maybe because this stupid fight, you're not going to send me an e-mail congratulating me for being such an awesome person. but maybe i'm just overanalyzing it and you might.
is it because you're going to feel like a dill-weed because i called you out on it and you wanted that e-mail to surprise me? because i can tell you that i can act surprised.  in fact, the fact that i'm doubting you will make me actually surprised.  it's kind of ironic, right? kind of one of life's little beautiful moments.  don't you love life like that? these little moments that are sort of indescribable except for the two people that are experiencing it at the same --
oh.  i don't even know how to check it on this gay thing though. 
get in ma belly!
fat bastard.
so.
okay, here's one, here's one. do you think you could train a parrot, to train a parrot? what? 
rawwr! 
aaah!
 ugggh.
oooooh.

dang it. took a risk, went for it.
it's tough to say cause my computer's asleep at the moment.
barbecue sauce.
nah.
because you don't know who my boss is, right? cause you don't know what my job is. sounds like you're s.o.l. 
wait don't! okay.  i just didn't want to tell you what my job was because it was embarrassing, 
no, it's not. uhm... i look for work and a career. monsters.
not if you stop watching right now.
just saying.
kinda crazy, huh?
one minute you're here, the next...  you're wormfood.
isn't it weird that worms are cannibals?
they eat humans.
so you're saying worms don't eat other worms.

no like, i left my retainer up there. my clothes!
i'm in a towel for christ sakes.
why did you do this?
hey, you're watching jake and amir.
you're not going to say, good job?
hm, it's kinda hard to sit down with this knife in my back. can you actually grab that for me? and don't twist it.
okay.
i meant the imaginary one!
i'm just nervous, you know? i love her so much and in a couple hours, she could just come in here, look me square in the eyes and go, you are the weakest link. goodbye.  goodbye.
hey, to pass the time, let's read old text messages between her and me.
last night was incredible. you made me feel like a woman again. i had no idea my breasts were so sensitive. okay, now let's read one that she sent to me...
she's calling me! hello? oh my god! she's been in an accident!
i'm kidding, you idiot.
what?
hey, just so you know: whatever happens, me and you are going to stay friends.
then we're through, okay? you're dead to me.
yeah. sometimes i say stupid things. it's like, hi. i'm amir. have we met? it's-- 
who'd you choose?
and amir? you are...
so, i guess you made your decision.
well, let me just show you what you're going to miss:
hey! what are you doing?!
i know. but i need to show you what you're going to miss!
me too. wait. no. i'm not sorry; i'm sad. you made me sad.
let go of me!
why not?
what was the last thing you said to her?
i'm sorry.
you're just gonna let me feel like this is my fault?
i said, i'm sorry, and you said, thanks. like i'm apologizing? like, i didn't do anything.
although, who has two thumbs and should be apologizing for not doing anything? this guy.  no, i'm just kidding. you tried to push her out of the way when the bus hit her though, right?
yeah, really, really fast. from your girlfriend to dead in two minutes flat. it's a world record. hazzah!
yeah. this is my way of coping with things, okay? trust me, i'm hurting more than you are.
wait, you think you're sadder than i am?
ha!
okay, she was my girlfriend for longer.
yes, but we had a deeper connection.
yeah, that sounds alot like my story with her. only, in my version, you were the bus.
don't run me over, bus.
it's crazy, huh?
one minute, you're here. the next, worm food.
isn't it weird that worms are cannibals?
they eat humans.
so you're saying worms don't eat other worms?
isn't it?
duh.
i'm lonely.
um, i believe this ice is for you.
as you have just been iced!
chug it, pledge!
do you have any idea what the punishment is for a bitching bro who doesn't wanna chug his ice?
okay, me neither. i was hoping you would. the website's kind of hazy on that.
no no no! it has to be a more severe punishment than that.
chug! chug! chug! chug! chug! chug
sorry. you wouldn't wantyou wouldn't want me to apologize though if you knew what this bro was doing, you'd want me to yell 
okay you're frustrating me! you're
gladly!
what.
well, i think there's a rule that says you can't really chug two in a row, because
and now, since you don't have an ice, i will ice  you!
how do you have that?!
i was iced twice on the way to work!
once on the subway, and once right in the lobby of our building!
hey, you're watching jake and amir. not that i care.
yeah well i do, okay, i care too much.
i wish people would stop saying, i'm a foodie, and start saying what it actually is: i'm a prick about food.
your twitter.
what do you mean whatever? it was your tweet, i didn't get it either.
so, why'd you tweet it?
yeah, great. get out of here.
reading your tweets. doy.
then why'd you tweet them, okay? how many retweets did they get?
go to your tweets and then go toyour tweets, retweets
go to retweets and then your tweets
see?
how to delete what? your account?
well they're all dumb tweets, so i would just
yeah well all tweets are read.
yeah, cause you tweet dumb things.
sorry for making you feel so insecure.
jesus. how many followers did you have?
 i would not have done that.
let go of me!
why not?
hey.
you're my best friend, right?
yesterday, people were just talking smack about me. saying that i was obsessed with you and that you didn't care about me and 
i know. but, at the end of the day, they're wrong, right? you're my best friend?
yeah.
yeah, well they're wrong about that for sure, but they're also wrong about another thing, about you not being my best fr
everybody. are you my best friend?
mhm. including me?
 hey it's me, are we best friends?
what are you talking about? this is the only one i made in this style.
this one is just faces, no names.
i'm not, i'm losing money.
technically we're losing money.
i made a promise on our behalf to busted tees that these would sell like pancakes.
 not that well. are you or are you not my best friend?
uh huh.
stop thinking about the shirts, okay? pretend i'm wearing any other shirt about us.
oh my gosh. they're right.
there's nothing i can do but try to reverse what has already happened. to make every day a small step in a big mission to win you 
and the shirts?
good. nobody was making fun of me. i just didn't want to guilt you into saying something you didn't mean.
that's water under the bridge. now! how many of these  can i put you down for? 16? 64? we're pretty much way 
hey, you're watching jaaake--  sorry.

yeah, well, i didn't wanna lie.
right, well you gotta sweeten the deal a little bit. right? you gotta tickle the generals. 
--a little bit. so, just stop focusing on that one line. i feel like you're harping so much on that one specific. the rest of the resume is gibberish, i got a cyst on my neck that doctors don't even know how to drain yet, bec--
mhm. just pop in, press play, and enjoy--
it rhymes.
 feel this. and you're worried about--
if people can even talk about my music? who cares about music!
yes it is, this is his resume.
no, i'm not- why would i look for a new job? i got the best coworkers in the world! 
hey, you're watching jake versus amir. 
i slapped your back.
hey, it's amir. i know this is a prank call, leron so don't f**king bother leaving a message because i won't believe you.
hey amir, it is i. you. me. it's you, amir. lost again on my way to work. or should i say your way to work. but that is nay the point of this meeseege. the following is a note to my future self: firstly, don't tell jake you got lost. tell him you were at an oscar after party, he'll think you're connected and cool. if he asks where the party is, spin another golden lie out of nothing. shit, you forgot socks this morning, you idiot. this, coupled with the fact that you already forgot your shoes is gonna make you look like a real dumbwad. okay, if jake makes fun of you, just try and kick pat in the face. oh! remember to look up the name of that song that's in your head right now.
aaaaaoowww! oh! and remember that sick freestyle that was in your head this morning! okay, here it is.
and then... you couldn't think of anything to rhyme with liquidatious, okay. oh! one last thing, grocery list okay. buy adult diapers.
oh, hey. jake? 
oh my gosh, you'll never guess where i was this morning.
an oscar after party! okay dude, i was with forest whitaker, jake!

because you can't stop me, and you won't stop me. because i'm done, i'm fed up. i can't afford it anymore, and i want out, alright? it's smothering me. i want to just leave it all behind. 
rent, ass, okay? i live in an apartment full of people that hate me and i just can't take it anymore, okay? all of a sudden, people give a crap where i leave all my garbage.

okay, you know what? forget it, i'm done. i just, i'd rather crash with you for the rest of my life than ever go back there.
that would actually make sense because i could just live with you rent free then, we could just, we could just chill out and..

i asked you ver-- . . .i asked you very politely, ok? it's nothing bad. so just give me his e-mail address.
all right, me and you have been arguing way too much recently and i think we just need to spend some time apart. 
you know, just get away for a while. just go our separate ways.
perfect. submitted.  you're about to be so happy. 
i just booked us--
an eight night, ten day mexican staycation!
from work.
yeah, from the office.
 pack your bags, we leave tonight.
i'm not taking 'no' for an answer.
staycation!
do you not get why we need this? do you not see why we need this?!
yeah, because it does 'fit' into your schedule!
you know, why go on vacation? you just took me on a guilt trip.  hey, that's pretty neat. best part of all, i didn't have to drop 40k on that.  and we don't have to suffer through any all you can eat banana leaf buffets or go through any scuba diving lessons which is perfect because i'm deathly afraid of water anyways!! 
 bravo. bravo. bra--what a victim you are. you must be in the worst shape of ever.  i feel so bad for jake.
you know what? guess what? that e-mail i was going to send your dad? yeah, it was bad. it was a trojan horse.  you know what that is? it's a computer virus that would have taken down his whole network. now do you want to go on a staycation with me? or am i too crazy?!  
hey evan, you're watching jake and amir!
hey, did you get my e-mail about me wanting to pitch you movie ideas?  
all right, first up. it's a movie, but it's also a sweater. what?! you can wear it, you can watch it, you can do whatever. looks fabulous, be good. it's sweater: the movie. 
so you know how every good movie is just a combination of two other movies? 
ok, so you're definitely not going to like fever hitch. 
this one is based on a script. 
not documentaries!  ok, so it's a documentary about scripts, right? 
the girl with the dragon tattoo fast, and too furious. no.
stewart thinkpen was an average guy--
argh, sorry, just took me forever to perfect that voice. 
harold and maud and kumar. ok. 
oh! if you liked the sweater movie--
--well, let me get through the freaking pitch without you tainting it with your negativity! sweater 2: the jacketing. 
it's like, a lot of it is just dead skin.   
american beauty and the beast.  just give me something man.  
she was a girl who had all the answers. he was the boy who had just one big question. and then--argh, i've got nothing. if you've got something, that'll help me out a lot. 
all right. maybe piling it. 
the sisterhood of the traveling antz, with a 'z'. 
ok, maybe. 
the talented mr. ripley's believe it or not. 
not yet. these are pit-- oh, i see. rip--yeah. maybe. 
uh, all right. i think that went well. 
well, now i know what you don't want to hear, so that i can sort of re-imagine everything--
ouch.  that is a tough pill to swallow. heh, you got to understand that i was really jazzed about these ideas last night. i was like air-boxing with no one, writing them down, getting super jazzed. so for me to hear that, that's tough man. that's tough for me to hear. 
 i guarantee that if you knew what you were saying to me, if you knew how much that would affect me, that you wouldn't have said half the stuff you just said. 
yeah, i think i'm going to peace out too. i might take a personal day because i feel like there's a--
staycation! and-- you're right. why'd you say that stuff, man? 
you smug little prick.
sorry.
 ha ha ha! bye, dude! i'll see you!  hey, what's up?
no! i was talking to my friend raymond and then he had to leave the second that you got here.
anyway, what have you done today?
same.
same same.
same same same, triple same, knasty knasty. i'm actually pumped to work with you today. 
just being at work is a thrill. why do you have to question on what?
oh! cowards! everyone here is a coward for that. bastard got my desk too. 
stop, okay! stop, it's not worth it! we are gonna get through this!
we are gonna get through this!
 gonna get, gonna get, my mind off you!
it's not that bad!? it's wet!
 no, i couldn't have done this, because earlier this morning i went pet shopping with my friend raymond from earlier, and then we both got a hamster and went to my apartment and then we got to work at the same time. my hamster's name is...  toilet paper, and toilet paper...
alright, let's just blow today. can't we just take a personal day and go for a picnic or something? i'm sure the bandit left us some sandwiches and a frisbee. 
check under your desk maybe it's there.
what!? no! how..? who... who did... this ... it's what i'm pissed about.
yeah. well, you know what? the bandit must have left the food and the frisbee at my apartment earlier today because he was distracted, busy with the scheming of things, so why don't we swing by my apartment and then the bandit might have to take a dump real quick.
 alright, just cut me some slack man, at least i'm trying.
i'm lying because you don't trust me ever. 
why tell the truth to someone who always thinks you're lying?
alright, you want the truth? the truth is i just wanted to hang out with you, okay? i'm sorry, i wanted to go on a picnic with you. but then... this bandit!  with this joke, this prank just ruined everything! let's just... let's get out of here, man. let's just forget it. let's set it and forget it. i think best course of action: gtfo.
 good good, man. how are you?
i'm fine. i'm better than fine, actually. i'm great. hey, uh, could you do me a flavor?  no, i said flavor instead of favor but could you go into my drawer and pull out one of the pieces of paper that's there? 
ok, could you go like five minutes without editorializing? 
i'm serious, i was talking to sarah and like we both agree that you never say anything plainly. you always have to like, have the last word and it just, it gets really tiring. 
w-w-wait! could you find one that says 'oh, good driving sir. we owe you eleven hundred dollars'? and please do it without adding your two cents for once. 
no, that's not it. keep looking. keep looking for the one where it says they owe me the cash. 
you sure about that? like is that a fact or is this another case of the jake's, where you just keep on talking to hear the sound of your own voice because honestly, if it's the latter--
bitches and cream, that blows. 
fu-udge-sicles. anyways, how was your weekend? 
good good, yeah, mine was bad. really bad, actually. i got arrested for doing 90 in a zero. 
well there's no like sign or anything but it was a freakin' kindergarden so yeah, i think you're supposed to go zero! 
ok, please don't do this now, ok? i'm being held without bail, so it would be really nice just to hear someone say that it is not my fault. 
there you go again with the talkie-talkie! you sound like the freakin' cop that i punched. hey, what was the name of that song...?
yes. that's the one. tight. 
hey, starting when? 
so say that! 
jake! jake! 
where are you? 
okay, you just left your desk two minutes ago and you didn't say anything. 
sighs what does that mean? 
okay, should i chill out here, or you want me to wait for you? 
hey! let me in, okay? somebody's coming. 
he already left. 
how much longer do you have in there? 
fine, fine. i'll stay, but i won't say anything. 
hey, i read on yahoo news that laptops are cooking people's- 
alright, fine, okay? keep it mum, alright? mum's the word. 
me? you said no talking! that was a kick! 
oh my god! singing isn't talking. 
why do i- why do i bother? why do i bother if you're just not gonna like it? 
it just doesn't- i don't buy it man. i'm sorry, it doesn't make sense. why would i- why would i do this? like, it doesn't- it doesn't help. you don't like me. it just drives you away even more, and then mumble in the bathroom? that's so- it's cold, man. this is a waste of time. 
hey, you're watching me!
well... mostly me, though, if you think about it.
can i have the rest of that bar -- that kit kat bar?
 break me off a piece of that tick tack tart.
just give me a break, man.  give me a break, man. give me a break--
which means you've had three! so give me one! give me one of your four bars. just give me one of the four!
 no thank you. you know what? on second thought, i don't really want it. i'm watching my weight -- watching it go up.  no, i'm going to toss it, though. 
i had a second thought.
you already gave it up, okay? it was mine to throw away. i had a second thought; i didn't want it anymore; so i threw it away. what's it to ya?
you gave it to me.
i asked you for it and you gave it to me, so it was mine. i could have done whatever i want with it, alright? it's gone now. forget it. let it go. it's a sunk cost. live life without the bar.
 fine! just, ughh...  so, if i eat it and two days later i take a crap and it goes in the toilet, he doesn't complain about that. but if i put it in the garbage now, then it's a bigger deal. i don't understand what the difference is. it's not his. it's gone. but he just latches on. he latches on and i can't let it get to me. i just have to let it go-- it's a frickin' kit kat bar, man! it's 99 cents! what do you want?! a quarter? you want a quarter for it, you're going to be that petty? just forget it, man! just pretend that i dropped it on the ground and i didn't want to eat it -- does that make you sleep at night?
well, i'm not going to let you sit here and sulk about it, okay? say something! you're obviously pissed!
yeah? well, sometimes wishes don't come true. i'm sorry.
i mean, when i was six i had a wish, too. i had a wish that everybody i knew would be dead. how's that for a wish?
bet you wish that one didn't come true.
you know, if you're gonna be a bitch about it, then here:  a full kit kat bar. enjoy that, ya bitch!
okay, you know what? here!  take the whole lot! jakey gets all the kit kats. enjoy them, ya bitch!
because i buy two or three a day and i save one, okay? but i bet you knew that already, didn't you, bitch?
alright, you know what? here's an idea: we go bar for bar -- see who can eat the most candy.
yeah! watching it go up!
 are we doing this contest, or not?!
sorry are you gonna finish that sandwich?
well just give it to me!
hey. hey. hey. hey. speak!
yes.
yes i remember, i don't-- you don't have to give me a history lesson. 
what? which cousin?
evan? johnny? scott?
mad- okay,  girl? so she's not your cousin!
no i can't! okay, both my parents are only children; you knew that.
he's adopted!
...what.
you look like a jerk!
ugh, this is not what i envisioned when they asked me for permission and i said yes.
yeah, they emailed me and asked if they could use my creepy videos to make a funny song out of it. well, i'm not laughing!
 they gave me final cut approval, okay? three weeks ago they send me a rough and it just sat in my inbox. yesterday, on a whim, i reply "i have no notes". i don't know what got into me; it just happened. ninety minutes later they send me a final cut; i guess they made some last minute audio tweaks. i respond, sight unseen, "this is f***ing gold, i'm proud to know you guys. love, amir", and then, this thing!
lemme just-- lemme see if i can ask them to take it down or something. 
i think that video's gotta go down or something.
yeah that's true. i dunno, i feel bad.
that's true. i dunno, it is catchy.
shut up okay! maybe-- let's just keep it up at this point.
yeah it's a no-go on the vid going down, man, i'm sorry, i talked to them but they won't budge. they're being douchebags about it!
 --bah, so.
they didn't do that. no--
don't delete it! put it back up then!  i can actually, i'm an admin, right? 
 you don't have to poke, i'll be poke. they're looking for poke. they're gon' find you. they're gon' find poke. and you can poke and--
 it's a good *idea*.  so you can poke and tell-- you don't have to poke anywhere, i'm lookin' for poke! i'm gon'... is- i can't really do it solo.
don't delete it, put it back up!
i'm the one who wants to be -
i lied.
ah!
mmhmm.
hrrrr.
hrrrr.
ah!
all rice.
henry!
grrrr. shit on ye!

rock paper scissors shoot!

if i s--, if i see, if i see that poison in here
you know, it just doesn't have to be a suggestion of what i'm doing wrong, it could be like a suggestion of what i'm doing right
actually, should be that, should be tips of how i'm doing stuff well
i would never, tell you how to improve yourself, ok? and that's not just because your perfect
you're gonna be humming a different tune once i, open the box

woah... woah.. woah... what's that?
what? why don't you do that from home, for the rest of the day, huh? come on buddy, get out of here.
yea well there's a first time for everything... man. this the first time i've ever done this.
but that's it, alright? go home, bitch! alright mista white?
you should have thought about that before i caught you looking at viral videos.
i'm supposed ta post a post, what are you a broken poster now?
are you high, man?
uh-oh
spaghetti 
yea, well honestly i'd love to, but he was just looking at legit youtube videos.
yea, well he was looking at porn, too. it's so gross to say it but he was.... he was looking at pornography music videos.... pornographic music videos and he was masturbating. he was jerking it at his desk.
right there, he was doing it.
yea, well i doubted it too, which is why i sent him home for the day, but its up to you if you want to bring him back tomorrow. but as of right now, the way he's acting, my vote is for fuck no.
anybody, buddy.
barely on thin ice.
kevin
i'm done here, alright? all i'm saying is... keep your intern on a shorter leash.
cool... ok jake, here we go. jake! can you help us settle a debate please?
is it okay to masturbate in the middle of the office? is that cool? is that a cool thing to do?
jake you're watching amir- ah, frig.
terribly bad maybe.
ugh, i don't know how you can eat that garbage.
yeah, do you have any idea how they made that lettuce?
in a friggin test tube? in a lab? on the back of human mice?
you doubt, that they can grow human ears, on the back of mice? ehuheh, heh!
do you know what a humster is?
a hybrid cell line made out of hamster oocytes fertilized with male sperm. ok, that food you're eating might as well be a cockmeat sandwich.
better--i'm a vegan.
meaning, i don't eat meat, i don't eat wheat, and i don't eat treats, now take a seat.
sitting on a bed of lies, maybe. deep-throating a cockmeat sandwich, praying to the only god you have that mommy doesn't find out, well guess what?--
here's a riddle for ya. you know right now you can walk into a japanese grocery store in downtown tokyo and buy a cube of watermelon. and i'm not talking about like a cubic watermelon, i'm talking about a legit cube of watermelon. do you have any idea how unnatural that is?
no, did you know that right now there's a group of scientists at monsanto on a lunch break, at a chipotle for all i care, and when they get back, they're gonna be working on a tomato that's genetically altered to be the size of an apple.
not cherry tomatoes! and not pizza.
did you know that tomato paste isn't a glue substitute? like, you can't use it to glue stuff.
ok, well right now my dad is getting a birthday card that's drenched, unreadable and disgusting.
turns out i didn't! thank you very much, meat eater! ohhhh!
no no no not in a while.
 ok, one. and that was a goof, alright. plus, you never answered my humster question--you know what it is, or not?
oo what? oo what?
oo you're wrong!
oo you're wrong!
 yarrr you be watchin' us so walk the flank!
 don't embarrass me.
is everything cool?
jesus...why the vest?  
my god...why the vest though?
yeah, it's stupid.  it's very stupid.
how long have you had the vest for?  ha.  should put the vest to sleep, keep the cat alive.
forever?  there's still tags in it.  
do you keep the tags in it forever?  
is that like a...thing?
i can't not notice the vest, okay?  it's weird that you're wearing a vest.
what do you mean "nothing else to wear"?  you're already wearing something else; you're wearing the vest over that.  so it's like you're wearing a shirt jeans, that's a thing.
on you?  like is that a joke on yourself
so why're you-why is that top button unbuttoned?    that's clearly a choice, right?
i didn't say it was cool.
i definitely didn't call it stylish.
is that a...is that a watch?  
why...all the effort?  why're you wearing a leather band?
i'm saying, like, goin' to the mall, that's like a lot of effort.  
is the cat gone?
dog tags?
so you're already wearing one?
so you have two?
hey you're watching ...

bachelor party last weekend. yeah, my friend from high school, marty's getting married so you know i came to play.  first step is a nice, little brunch with his family and i'm already a little buzzed after three four lokos and a shot of schnapps, some bozo jokingly dares me to bite into a glass of orange juice.  before he even gets to the just kidding i am tooth-deep in the thing. i'm not an idiot, okay, so i think the thing's gonna crack but my eyes widen with fear when the bitch explodes in my mouth. i'm talking razor-sharp glass shards just cutting my mouth up from uvula to incisor, there was blood everywhere. alright, next thing i know i'm in the back of donnie's camaro, he's the best man, and people are just begging me not to fall asleep. i'm laughing maniacally, my face is like a blood-sprinkler, the red liquid's just shooting everywhere, getting on the interior and stuff. to make matters worse i wasn't even invited to the frickin' thing. so i start passing out, you know, nature's promise and all.
i wake up in post-op four hours later and i needed 31 stitches to close me shut, nurse is livid, just crying in the corner because i've been shitting myself nonstop which sounds standard, but it's not.
they choose this golden moment to give me a hospital bill. uh-oh, daddy doesn't have health insurance. so i book it, alright. cut to interior, hospital, day, later, i am barreling skull-first into a doctor, right into his chest, and he gets plowed to the floor. medical equipment everywhere, alright. the beeper falls onto the ground and i just jump on it like a nazi taking a grenade for his german cohorts. he looks passed out, but i'm not gonna take that risk, okay, so i shove the beeper three inches into my butt and i just take off in a dead sprint due north, remember that direction 'cause it's gonna come in handy later. i'm three towns over before i even realize nobody's chasing me and at that point i'm thanking god because my groin is torn to shreds.
for 14 miles. and the bitch still works. 
a couple months late
hey, can you help me out with my bucket list? you know, flesh it out, make it a little longer
yeah, i know. let me ask you a question. do you believe in me? 'cause i just got off of the phone with my dad and he was just berating me. half an hour straight. screaming. i didn't' even get a word in.

either way, i'm just gonna look up the definition of duplicate and call you out on it. i'm sorry. that is too rich.

ok, right, just focus. so--
you think this is too expensive? what do you think about those twelve bean bags, huh, man? you think those were cheap?

yeah, it's to encourage discourse, communication, right? let's say i go to your desk area, right, and i want to borrow a fricking stapler or whatever.
anyway, i go to your desk area and suddenly we're having a water cooler moment, right? so check this out. hey, what's up dude? whoa, i love your shirt.
it is amazing. 
it's incredibly soft, but not in a too soft way where it's like effeminate, but it's just super, super nice.
see? we had a moment. me, you, your awesome shirt.
you do? 
exactly! ok, you're going to love this next idea. every hour, at like eighty past--
well, hear me out, a soothsayer is going to appear right over there--
yes, so he's just going to come up clouded in smoke and we're all just going to emerge next to him, chanting, being all sort of- our psyches mingling.
yeah. at eighty past the hour, of course.
are you sure? i mean, i already booked him, he's pretty cool.   
he's going to hate this. 
see? pretty good, right? 
wow. i am... honestly so happy i could cry.
oh! by the way, you owe me like thirty-six hundred for the soothsayer.

no!
i'm begging you not to do this.
this has gone from being the best day of my life to the second-worst, easily.
then people are gonna think i stole it from you!
no! you're not-- are you really not even gonna clarify that--
--not a dog!--
not a dog!
yeah, i--. i've never s--. you're being so mean right now. if you're gonna steal it and not clarify that you stole it from me when people accuse you of stealing it, at least admit that you're being mean right now.
yeah, i was the first to admit it.
i--. yeah, well.
i would keep the voice
but i would clarify that if people thought that you stole it--


what are you--
you're not even doing it right.
so, i can keep--

my picks are so hot, it's jacuzzi. 
in accent i'm the one fighting here, not you, not you and not you. 
i was doing it with the hand motion if you think it's-
hey here's an idea, let's share our answers and then we can split the winnings.
then we can get something together like a booze cruise.
because it's a frickin' cock meat convention, it's just dudes. hey can you do me a favour and read this e-mail from my dad and tell me if there's one thing that you can think of that he doesn't call me out on.
i'm trying to!
yeah, usually i only charge it for like 10 minutes a day.
well, what i need is like a power grid. you just put the phone on there over night and forget it.
will you take me to a sky mall if i pay you?
almost! you?
give it up!
it does seem less genuine now that you said it after he yelled at you. 
 hey, you're watching jake and amir.
i know it kills you to see me doing so well.
oh, by the dubs, who won the oscar pool?
hehehe, why uh-oh?
hehe...you just, you said you were gonna send out an email with how everyone did, and you never did. so..
hahahahaha.
i never said you stole or cheated or any-
okay.  not that you cheated, what text though?

hahaha. let me see the text.
i guess so, i mean, is that even true? you won like 200 dollars.

yeah. i have oily skin. it's a greasy t-zone.

first of all, okay, they're not teenagers. they're all fifteen years old.
 you guys lied to me.
they were in second grade uh, when i was in second grade, so .
i was held back. constantly, if you must know. eight straight years in second grade before i decided to turn it on. alright, i flip it on like a light switch. i'm powering through third, fourth, fifth grade, sixth grade comes along, i open my stupid little trap, and the hammer comes down!
not a peep! alright, but then they find out that my reading is still at a second grade level and my math just isn't there.
yeah, turns out i just left it off. they shipped me back to second grade with my tail between my legs and every teacher in the hallway just booing me. i spent another nine and a half spottin' second grade. i didn't say a peep the entire time! but hey, at this point, they're already hip to that game so they just keep me there.
not a peep.
mum was the fricken' peep.
they're tutoring me.
they're tutoring me in math, english, physics...
ah, eight squared! you guys just taught me this.
oh, 64!
film. two words. 
titanic. 
the titanic. 
alright, my turn.

yea we won't be strangers, man..   
haha bad joke.
 hey, can you help me upload these videos to collegehumor?  something's acting whack.
w-w-w-wait!
okay, so basically the crux of this shot is that mythat's my boy, bradlyn, in that tree and he's just hurling hard, hard rocks and like apples down at cars that drive by.  
yeah, this video ishaha right there this video is really polarizing on youtube.  i loved it, but everyone else really, really hated it.
yeah, if you like that video, you're gonna love the next one.
 well then you're gonna love the next one! 
 it's called inversed snot rocket, okay? 
 basically the crux of the short is that
 no!
 you don't go!
 i'm just excited to tell you 
 the crux of the short, that's it!
 okay, it's basically w-at the basic level of it it's just two people putting the spray paint bottle in the notthe the things are going up my nostrils and out of my mouth like and inverse snot rocket. 
 you don't touch me! 
 you don't touch me!
 i am chill!  just don't freakin' grab my shoulder like that.
 okay, in this next video right?
 in this next one, that's the one that's legit uncomfortable to watch!
 yeah, well this one, like, my friend, trayson, right?  he builds this ramp at the edge of a drained lake
 okay, we built this homemade catapult, right?  a twenty foot catapult and we put his grandma's chocolate lab in it and i'm holding   it down, but the hound just bites my neck, i shoo the mutt off the thing, but i'm holding the catapult with one hand and it just flies outta my hand clips my chin and it's lights out for me!  the-look at that, right there,  the top of my skull
 just hits the small of my back and i'm just like, "haha haha haha ha".
 i'm excited to show this, okay?  more than just being excited, i'm excited to show this to
 me.
yeah. hey, do you have someone you could set me up with, like on a date?
just. i'm lonely and horny, so. 
ok, i've been on 5 dates in my life man. all right? the first one ended up insanely well but there's no way in hell she's ever going to go out with me again.  two of the girls i gave pink eye to.  fourth one, she ended up super, super pissed, but not at me. fifth one, i really cannot for the life of me remember, oh right! no, you know what?  you killed her with a bus! 
ok, are you afraid of me not being me on the date? like me not being real, because i assure you, i will be there, it will be me, full throttle. love me or hate me, you gotta love me. 
here's something cute and quirky.  let's order dessert first. haha, that's weird, i'm different. 
a lot of girls don't like guys that kiss and tell. well, let me be frank with you, yet again, sweetheart. i never kiss, and always tell.  i keep telling people how much i've never kissed. 
and at the conclusion of the night, we walk home, i rub my hand against the dirty park bench, and just start rubbing your eyes.
yeah, well they probably did. 
sorry. is this still in character, like we're on the date?
 what do you mean, no?
is this why you invited me to this restaurant? to embarrass me in front of everyone? you slut!  
ok, this isn't a game, baby. this is me! all right, my heart is exposed right now and you can either tear it out, or s- or say yes and make me the happiest man ever.  
 thank gosh, promise?  i swear, all i want to do is lay down and hug.
yes, very cool, very cool.
yes, rock on.
well they didn't do anything for me!
 we wanted to give a little love to those who donated more, so if you donated less than five dollars, you guys are rock stars, keep kickin' butt, every dollar counts, but: please press stop now.   alright, those cheap bastards are gone, so--
 our boss forced us to do this!
against our will!
when collegehumor recently said they wanted to help with japan relief, i said count me in, what can i do to help?.
ok, don't you think conan's being kind of a douche about this whole jay leno thing? i mean, all the guy wants is his show back.
if every one of you doubles what you've donated already, we can give twice as much,, to charity.
 well, when it comes to giving you can never give enough, so double what you've given, so we--
well, give more, specifically double as much--
didn't need to. making the video.
 tonight, i'm gonna have myself a real good time, i--

ok, well scht- let me rattle off some of these ideas, and then you can tell me if they have legit potential or not. number 1:--
okay, number 4. oh actually, number 10 then.
so you know to pop a zit on your back you need like a really long staw , and some elbow grease.
you know how everybody and their widow is just aching to have a song written about them?

hey y'all you're watching texas-sized edition of jake and...
alrighty-hoo.
nooo!
oh, wow.
how many fedoras did you try on!?
no no, these are different fedoras, it's you at different stores.

if you're embarassed by these pictures, how are you ever gonna actually wear the fedora?
what is wrong with you?
no.
no!?
please do not tag them on facebook.
promise not to tell?
it's me. 
i blog under a pseudonym so that people can't really tell--
my blog is a one stop shop for mom and pop, but don't bring dad around here. this ain't no place for dads. 
that's why i barely even used it, dude. 
barely on there.
it's too many. 
yeah, it's about being confident, sexy and fabulous. ok? guys can tell, trust me. 
did you know that a praying mantis have one spouse, one spouse for their entire life. ok, we can learn a lot from that. 
it's on the blog. 
ok, how about this for a true fact--
 so you were. 
praying mantises can screw for 9 hours straight, ok? it's the most tantric sex you could ever imagine and i'm just supposed to sit on my fat butt and not blog about that? like, no, i can't, what are you tal--
yeah, it's called reverse psychology, ok? i say it ain't no place for dads--
pony tails...are for ponies. 
ok, if you could just give me one bit of advice. just one suggestion, because right now i feel like it's coming--
after that, all right? next tip, ok, let's say--
you just lost all your credibility like that. 
no, but widely agreed that that slogan was the smartest thing i ever came up with.
my friend widely.
yeah, well you look like a short-haired horse! 
nah, i'm ok. tha--
hey, you're watching jake and amir, and to leave a numeric page, press 1.
i don't know.
it will just slice through this fig. it will cut through this carob. and if you don't believe me, let's do 'em both, at the same  ti-ahh
that's ok.  did you see it cut the fig? and just slice through that carob?
you didn't? 
 you didn't?  you didn't? but that's ok, because you know what, a good salesman powers through. how often do you cut a steak?
yeah.
yeah, now you know how sharp the paring knife is, right?  hm, hmmm.
and you have to go to jail. o.k? because these, these knives are a steal at any price.
i don't need a thumb, o.k., 'cause i got nine fingers left, nine reasons why these will be the last knives you ever have to buy.
mhmm, i am, i'm gonna put pressure on the yound to snatch these up a.s.a.p. because supplies are limited.
yeah? well you're losing the deal of a lifetime. how's that for deadly?
oh these knives? sorry, these are not for sale. i'd be crazy to sell these to you.
i'll take the money but you cannot get these knives. i'm sorry.
i spent a fricken g on these knives, like, an hour ago, i can't just give them to you.
no, i'm trying to sell you these carobs and figs, the softest fruit you'll ever see, but you were just obsessed with the knives so i thought i'd do that for a bit before veering the argument back to carobville. unfortunately, i got a little sliced en route, so-
 you need a fig.
best friend.
o-positive. as in oh, i'm positive you'll need a fig and a carob when i'm done with you-
o.k., let me call her back. 
 americans are paying at the pump - 
 whasevah.
 yek.  let me ask you a question.  you on the good book?  the facebook?
 yeah?  it's kinda like myspace but for college kids, it's all interactive.
 you don't think it's interactive?
 i'm saying these privacy settings they're completely wack.
 oh, come on, you gotta be pretty nave to think zark fuckerberg isn't selling our shit to skymall for kickbacks at this point.
 ok, no no.  explain to me how my account gets hacked every day.
   yeah, because i think i'm logged out but i'm not, ok!?  so i'm typing it in but it's my status!
 i'm just saying that some of these privacy settings are legit anus-infested, ok?  everybody-like every rando with a smartphone and an aol account could just access my pics.
 i need to untag it.
  subcaption!  subcaption caption!
 i thought i was logged the fuck out!
 i am calm.
 because i wanted to sweeten the deal!  alright, i wanted to let people know what was in store for them if they signed up for the frickin' group!
 well, ah, ok, here's the thing.  i got amped up, right, i was trying to pump myself up to actually do the video one day and i said you know what, i'm ready, so i end up slamming my nuts in the door, and what am i gonna do?  just sit on the video? no, i decided to upload it, and you know what?-
 exactly!  and you know what?  those three views they're probably all from a frickin' skymall and zark fuckerberg he's walking around right now with massage boots over his head because it's a kickback from the frickin' mall!
i know what you're wondering. why am i dressed like a champion?
ooh... impressed?
yeah, it was a little cold, but -uh- it's worth it.
-to participate in my office obstacle course?
why, you're afraid you can't beat my time?
my lap time. one lap around the office hurtling over chairs to the
one minute and eight seconds
yeah, well forget it.
i mean if you want i could set it up
-up and start... okay 
you didn't let me start my watch.
that's against the rules.
how does that have anything to do with your shin?
no. you can't dock-
that was - you didn't do any of it. you didn't hurdle over the chairs.
i guess like three seconds- four seconds 
red?
it's batter.
here'a hint, bake something and leave it on your desk. it's a great way to meet coworkers, okay, people will be dying to taste your tasty treats.
how's this for desperate and needy? i'm lonely and i wanna make friends.
okay. so what do you suggest?
uhh- no thank you.
it's called eating healthy.
done.
well, i wanna see how this brownie thing plays out first.
yeah.
people let's get closer.
you'll never guess who i ran into in the elevator. 
guess!
no, i said you'll never guess. 
it's not. it's not even close. 
i don't know... what? who's that? what's he saying?
no, i shouldn't have even had you guess. i don't even know anyone's name anyway. 
yeah, which makes it all the worse that i barrelled into this dude in the elevator. 
yeah. i mean, accidentally but like at full speed, yeah. 
i didn't know his name. 
heh. i don't even know your name. 
no. that's not it. it starts with a d, right? 
dude we should have a party. a get together. 
no no no we should just introduce each other to everybody, you know, at the party? that way, we can learn everybody's names. 
i have an idea. 
oh it's just to get this sandwich, i was hungry. 
ok, now i have an idea. 
mm! yeah! it's way better with ketchup!
oh, it's obviously a joke. we already know each other's names.
well, you're a terrible human being, joe-f. 
joel. right.  
laugh you're alive!
ok, you know what? i don't get it. because stay-at-home mom is the politically correct term.
i will never understand the..holly shit doobs is here!
doobs.
no!
so why are you here doobs?
as someobody with the audacity and heart to go after what they love.
cause he's got moxie. you know what moxie is? this is moxie!
i wish i had a fork and a knife to eat every single word i've ever spoken to you but instead all i have are this chopsticks...
oh, cats doesn't count.
mhh! that hurts.
no! no! no!
nah, stop, it's ruined.

oooh, didn't think you had the guts, mike o'malley! let's go to mo!
alright, pretend you have a gun now.
just pretend you have a gun and try to shoot me in the face?
you don't wanna do this dance, partner! i'm afraid you're  gonna be too slow on the draw--
well try again then, because i guarantee.. this one  won't be as successful, didn't think so--
 take that, dancing queen...
well then you shouldn't mess with the bull!
cuz then you're gonna get the horns for free . here we go, one more time--
euh, ja-- oh, jake, i had the weirdest, funniest dream.
you try teaching an all-night karate course, alright, and see how easy it is for you to stay awake!
no, i didn't frickin'-- i'm talking about my sensei, man, that guy is a god!
 i think something's wrong with me, man, i think i have mono. can one of you doctor guys, preferably the male one, look at me? i think i have a legit freaking mono right now.
can i ask you question? stand up so i can see your jeans.
it's a journal. 
as a goof.
all hallow's eve. 
yeah! you were texting, ok? and someone said something that made you laugh, and you were smiling, and then you looked up at me and like, you know, once--
yeah, exactly.
yeah! that's a win! ok, i count that as a 'w' in the old diary.
that's a journal.  this is a diary. 
dinner tonight?
i barely say it anymore!
exactly, and that's why it's funny to do that. 
you say stuff over and over, ok? that's what makes it funny.
no, no-
no, no! in a perfect world, everything would always stay the same. ok, nothing would ever change, you know that. 
journal. 
ok, we're still a go-ies then? 
just give me my old scroll bag backpack back, please.

my snake frickin', clipped me or something.
yeah went right for the jugular too, smug prick. got me once in the neck, twice in the forearm, and then like two more times in the abdomen.
i didn't feed the prick for like, two weeks 'cause she was being a bitch. then i decided to start taunting her, you know, dancing around with dead mice all over my body. dumb ass went for it! and got it!
so you're saying i'm dumber than a snake?
ok you should have been there man, leron was dying!
no he was legit dying, like he got bit by a snake last week but he was like too cool to go to the hospital....
it's my snake now because i liked her feistiness, ok? but it was a snake at the time. i thought i could tame the wild beast. turns out.... i could!
mmhmm....
ok don't tell me i shouldn't own pets, i've had like, ten owls in the past year. 
they're frickin' dead!  gives a shit?
hoot.... gives a shit! come on man!
just so you know, this silent treatment isn't winning! haha! ow!  come on man! that's gold, and you're not even cracking a smile!
what?
oh my god.... i think i just turned deaf.
yeah, i can't....  i can only hear noises and me, but not you.  like, i can't even tell if i can even hear this or just feel it....

 haha, you hear that you little serpent slut? i'm not deaf!
 haha ok, whoa! little bitch nicked me!

am i excused, like...?
right. and i stand by that.
dead or alive?
what about the mural, kare?
 yeah, a 200 foot by 10 foot concrete wall -- blank as the night -- ready to be painted by the imaginative fingers of today's youth.
and... i was able to... get one twice as big.
so... double the kids... on that... karen.
narc!
what about music, okay? some phat beats, dope rhymes, things like--
i can freestyle for about two and half hours straight. make your face leak underneath... all that stuff--
 i'm going to get a cd! a frickin' mix cassette tape -- how does that sound for a freestyle?
you can go... to jail! for killing and de-tusking an elephant. i mean, how long are we going to stand idly by--
okay, karen...?
karen! i have your wall! i have your wall, karen!
with no hands, bitches!
i don't know...
i gotta cut out early today...
yeah, well, i gotta go to prom.
oh my god. you sound just like her dad.
the girl that refused to go with me.
yeah, so me and my boys  rented a limo . we're gonna go... stag. 
that's when you go alone, without a date, but
'cause none of those douches ponied up the dough yet, all right? and they all said no to me. it's like, i'm doing all the leg work; the least they could do is not yell at me.
nah, i'm gonna go with mickey, my friend.  goal of the prom is to pour a gallon of milk on the bitch that refused this hand.
 okay, get this, poetic justice...
couple of weeks ago, a few of her friends beat the shit out of me.
not a bunch! okay, just two sluts that wouldn't take please, i'm sorry! for an answer.  they pushed me into a cow. dodged a bullet there...
what?
 okay, is there an answer i could give that wouldn't result in you hating me more?
 ...no.
yeah, it's, like, not even close to that...
i was gonna put this corsage on her milk-soaked wrist and plug away at her fingers like they're little udders, while the whole school hopefully chants, moo, cow, moo! moo, cow, moo! moo, cow, moo!
what?
 okay.
...i just have to, like, swing by for, like,  twenty seconds,  to go into the prom for, like, a little bit!  we're gonna go  for half a second!  to pour a gallon of milk on the bitch; i still wanna do that!
it's too late, okay; i already have the whole thing pretty much planned out.
 oh! speak of the devil!  hey bitch!  hey, i hope you're not lactose intolerant'cause you're getting milked tonight!  good! no, good, put him on.  hey sir. hi, yes, uh, your daughter is a nobody at high school. i'm friends with dylan, okay? i know what's cool. he wears frickin' sunglasses to class. yeah! no, i'm in the cool group, and we all agree that your daughter is a zero. she's less than a zero, and guess what? she's gonna wake up with cheese in her ears tomorrow morning, which ain't gonna help the situation.  y'know what, good, call the cops. i just won't show up then.  actually... can you not, because i wanted to show up and do the milkwell, i don't wanna get arrested! so now i can't goi dropped a g on this frickin' tux, sir! this was supposed to be the most magical night of my life, and you're basically telling me notthat i can't go, because i'mokay. great. bye.  yeah, my night just opened up hard, so we can hang out. i might wanna call in a bomb threat though, y'know; if the fuzz are gonna be there, we might as well frickin' make them earn their keep.

no big deal.
then i was right.
can't photograph this moment. this is the kind of moment you just have to be in.
we get so concerned about finding the right picture, the right frame that  we don't get the right memory.
'cause a moment is just that. it's a moment and then it's a second and as soon as you identify it it's over. so... 'cause you can look at the sun  and you can say-
what?
i know and i'm just saying not to take today for granted. 
'cause if you do  then it's just gonna slip awa- okay.
i'm just saying that if you do-
okay, but if you do, if you take today for granted, then you shouldn't, because it's just gonna slip away.
i don't care.
 another thing about the sun is that you can't stare at it 'cause it's too beautiful to take in.
nah, it's too much beauty for your eyes all at once.
that's what i said. 
okay. just don't steal it from me.
 you're stealing it 'cause i said it and now you're saying- just give me your phone.
give me your phone!
because i wanna take a twit-pic of this.
that's 'cause i didn't see how cool it looked and now that i see how awesome it is i really want it on my facebook wall. okay, i really wanna take a picture  then post it online, otherwise it doesn't exist. no, gimme!  gimme your phone!
okay? are you happy? disconnect, bitch! sign off. get away from the grid. it's over. you are so mad because- oh my- i'm taking a picture of that. i am  taking a picture, me and the grump.  tweeting it, hashtag douche doesn't know how to disconnect.  whatsoeva. where are you?  another thing about the sun...
washing jake and amir?

oh no! 
i will buy one.

okay.
i'll buy the shirt right now.
thank you.
you gotta learn how to be funny
jake, let's go, he's right
that's true
mine doesn't.
in the hand...
so?
took you long enough.
yeah, most of that is scene direction, though-
enough talk. what'd you think?
what did you think?
give me one thing, okay? give me one thing to hone in on. it's so broad.
just try to focus all your energy, like a laser, on one thing, yeah.
focus it. focus in on one.
wow! congrats, grad! you can read.
-probably autocorrected...
that impostor is from hawaii, i guarantee it.
maybe you'll be singing a different tune when you realize who we were thinking of for the male lead.
edward frickin' nort.
no, my cousin's lawyer, edward nort.
you should've heard mr. nort deliver that line. he nailed it in callbacks.
so basically, you're jealous 'cause we didn't cast you as the main guy.
you're not annoyed we went with nort over you?
you were seriously considered. you were!
yes!
-bad!
-no.
no.
hey, you're watching jake and amir!
lock the door, please.
you keep on telling me to ? heheh, what is that?
heheheh! come on, laugh! that's funny. i laugh at all your jokes, and trust me: they are not all winners.
okay, what is this?  i never studied the universal symbols for stuff.
how 'bout this: if you're really choking, spin around in your chair.
nahhh. not buying that! not buying that at all. that's a fake spin; you're just spinning to make it seem like you're choking because i told you to spin.
no no, this is just a game we're playing, okay? and you're not invited. so leave.
sorry, it's just that if this isn't a goof, it should be me that saves you, not some... other loser, alright? amir saves jake. that's... that's the lead.
i'm gonna eat your sandwich... so if you're alive... better stop me...
okay... great acting job. the best actor... -grammy... goes to... you!  you didn't laugh at any of my jokes... and now i'm not gonna save yours.  um...  ummm...  you're fired!  hm. wow... you know, i gotta hand it to you, man... didn't think you'd take it this far! hm. aah!
you know what? now i wish you are alive, because if you're dead, people are gonna blame me... and you're gonna feel... like a pony.  okay! this has been a dope lunch, thank you, but i don't deserve this star-treatment. so.
 hey, you're watching jake and amir.
nah.
 that was the best! are you guys laughing 'cause you're about to get fired?
i don't know, why'd you cut out at 3:30 to go get ice cream?
uh, actually, my dear watson, it was twelve.
no, you don't have to justify it to me. you do have to justify it to your boss, though.  don't you?
thirty three emails sent from your account to ricky, your boss. shame you weren't here to stop me. oh wait, i forgot. you're in a corn maze!
yeah, and then he responds as the donald, ya fired.
yeah, cream on the side.
and mixed in.
i just thought of it two seconds ago. otherwise i would've written it. but now, ricky gets the hit and he's livid.
for a thousand gs, i will un-send that email.
yeah, keep reading. it gets brat-worse.
you looked like a friggin dildo baggins!
i just thought of it! everything that i'm saying now, i just thought of so it's not in the emails.
alright, are we done here?

i'm cutting out early, okay? it's the first nice day of the year, and you expect me to spend it indoors? no! i'm going home!

i'm trying to get her a freaking externship, ok? do you realize how hard that is? sorry for caring.
so anyway, i tried to adopt this dumb-ass orphan--
--but they wouldn't let nine year olds do that either. 
i just met her at the freaking mall outside of a hotdog-on-a-stick and she called me 'daddy', demanding that i buy her lunch and take her and her friends on a six day shopping spree.  
emily go to your room!  sorry about that, i shouldn't have yelled.  go get yourself a jamba juice, can i have a peanut butter mood, please? thank you.  she is a burden but she means well.

ok, well let me finish--with the ingredient list, sorry but you sound like the frickin' fda.
yes, but can the ladies tell?
ok, i'm sorry, but she was a fat bitch. 
then he takes candy corn and melts it down to the raw, and a bottle of aunt jemima's maple syrup and melts it down to the raw.  then he takes one of those big lollipops, that you can only get at disney land and melts it down--
yeah! to the frickin' raw!

 that's cos my frickin abdomen feels like it was drenched in syrup two weeks ago and i haven't had the time to clean it off since. it's really dry and really itchy.

wow. cannot believe that lerona's twin is a ghost. it's like...  dead arm!
 sorry!
i'm playing a game!
osama bin hidin'. osama bin not.
well now he's not. we're gonna put him on trial, and i'm gonna grill him.  george foreman style. aka with onions.
because he's guilty
as charged, and i'm gonna bring him there.
what?
i saw a two month old new york post on the subway this morning with his face on it and figured we had caught the bitch, right? put a net around him and dragged his ass to yankees stadium, put him on trial in front of the fearless fans of bronx's alpha, parked his car in the harvard yard, took him to the square.
only it wasn't osama bin laden; it was my dad. and it wasn't yankees stadium, either, it was like my elementary school and i was naked.
mhm. yeah i fainted, twice. today, actually. once at my aunt's condo on the way over here in a bowl of cereal, and another on like a subway platform, and when i came to there were 35 police officers looking down on me, told me i missed the train by like half an inch. i was this close-
jake, amir, you're watching us
yes.
wow... notice anything different about me?
what?!  no, haha, ow, no no no it's still here. and it's hardened. ow.
yeah i got this badboy . this molds to the contour of my head.
no.
it's like a golf ball, it's growing on top of it.
i'm not ignoryou're ignoring thist!  so i insist, that you stop.
doesn't matter. it's not yours, i don't see why you care.
i just don't get why the second i get something as chill as a headset you're all up in my snatch about it.
correction, never get calls.
never got calls, then.
it's called i wanted people to call me on my new headset so i left my phone number in a gas station bathroom, okay? but i didn't 
hello?
i'm wearing a shirt, i guess. uh, yeah i'm hard, and it is a little wet. how did you even know i had a cyst?
hello? hello?  anyway where were we? oh right i remember where you were, 100%, firmly placed, inside of, my snatch.
none of your bitchness.
i don't think... no.
732?
jersey. i mean, is it?
sometimes i spend gas station time there, but like nothing more than that.
which is why i swear to god that i didn't leave your phone number.
i left your phone number. i just remembered and i wanted to come clean because the idea of me not telling you was eating me up 
i forgot it for half a second but then i remembered it: my sa...
dammit, no. it wasn't that, but you get the prize for getting it the closest.
no, that wasn't it. i already gave you the prize, stop lobbying for more.  hello? uh... i don't know why don't you 
snatch, yeah.
blato! 
not just any business card. my business card. 
my business card. 
my business card. 
 it's blank, or is it invisible ink?  here we go.  suddenly, the card comes to life. 
not yet!  not yet. 
it's already starting to work. 
it's fast! ok, if you know anything about invisible ink. 
well i do and this is fast. this is considered lightning fast in the industry. starting to--
what? 
you're mumbling, ok?  
well, it's not with water, ok? it's vinegar.  and the instructions are written   on the card once you've spritz it, oooh, that was tough. 
ok, you're just being a dick because you think this was a waste of $3000. 
a good business card should one: display pertinent information prominently, two: be simple and clean and three: be easily readable. 
a great business card should--
--one: make you earn that information, two: invisible ink, preferable but not necessary-- 
--and three: leave a lot to the imagination.
it's showing up.  
 ok, you know what? you have a lot of dumb ideas too but i don't call you out on them because you're my friend and at least you're trying and i want to see you happy.     
yeah. 
 which is fine, right? 
absolutely. 
lunch?
 take it easy man.  this could actually work--
whoa, just got my first business card tweet. 
yeah, it's from you. 
 sick card, bro. wanna do lunch? 
don't fucking pity me!
well hey, check it out, jake and a mirror.
that was a fricken courtesy laugh! and i appreciate it!
hey, you think this shaving cream stuff works on cats? yes or no, bitch i'm talking to you.
that's not what i asked you
yeah?
no! 
i don't know, haven't decided yet.
 i know. yeah, i know, i know, i know, i know. i know, i know, i know, i know! i know already, i said i know! jesus, you don't have to be a queen douche about it.
brown, i know right?
yeah, that too.
hm, this is easy.
would it be harder or easier if i had legit cat fur on my face though?
don't tell me what to do, okay?
i'll just get a sharper razor then.
look at that.
do they make circular razors?
like one that would like easily mold to the contour of a feline anus?
i'm gonna shave a cat.
ooh, nicked myself a little bit.
mmhmm.
ooh, okay. two for two!
i was going that slowly.
it's not chief.
you know, if you think this is funny...
imagine it being cat blood.  imagine wearing a bib with  a towel...  i fainted for a split.
no worries.
 i am honored.
it is an honor--
thank you very much, i am honored.
you've honored me.
i'm already honored, i'm staying.
shalom.
 i don't have to translate that. 
 stop!
i mean, c'mon, she pretty much gets it.
ya, cause that was a bad joke.
she missed the train and had to run here, so she feels gross and ugly.
well, then you'll look a little desparate, so...
well, she's probably just fishing for compliments, trust me dude, you do not
 you're just fishing for compliments. you don't look good.
nothing we both don't already think.
 jake says don't expect him to pay, okay? you guys are splittin' the bill. even in israel, people are going dutch.
i mean, it's 2011, so stop waiting for a--

i blew it, or she's a lesbian?
not stylin'.
your hand is purple.

got herb?!
hey.
sorry, uh, got to go take a shit. 
but jake's gift hath arrived. so whenever you guys get a chance, pay the peeper!  
huh?
well, uh, like i said, i ended up going for the deluxe package--
--so uh--
that changed the price by just a hair. so uh.
yeah! well you know how i was deciding between the headphone thing and the deluxe package? 
yeah, well, ok, sorry, i really, uhh, i got to go take a shit. but i was deciding between the headphones and the deluxe package and i ended up saying 'eff it, you only turn 26 once, i went balls to the wall and i got the deluxe package, so that's--
umm, sorry, like...whaaa--
i don't kn--yeah. it is. sorry, i'm like, ugh, really backed up and loopy right now.  so i'm like sort of saying one thing but meaning another.  yeah, it was sincere. what's your excuse for being a d-bag though?
well. like i said, since i ended up getting the deluxe package--
--the sum ended up falling somewhere in the neighborhood of like, god, i want to say like fourteen six a person. 
yeah, fourteen thousand six hundred dollars, but now i really have to go because i'm legit about to diarrhea my jeans. 
well, it's an all inclusive thing, ok? it's a deluxe package, that's the macbook air, the wine, you know, two days in the ring with a former pro, plus the plane tickets to espaa, so, it's a little bit much, but like, when he gets back we're going to have to divide up the receipts, see how much the food and wine cost, because that was not included.  neither was the boxing thing, actually.
no man, it's not all inclusive, but i think--
ah! 
jake. what's up, man? what were we talking about? sports?
it was going to be a surprise!  yeah! 
no way.
who doesn't? 
you're watching zack and amir!
okay, we don't want to spoonfeed the audience.
 ...of my owwwwwwwwn-- guys, you gotta work through that, okay? we're gonna be heckled a lot harder than that, protesting the kindergartners' graduation tonight...
why is it when you pick up a hobby, you're, like, a nice guy, but when i do it, i'm an asshole?
are you just mad at me because i haven't done any work in the last couple days?
or is it that i'm so good at singing now--
--that it makes everything you do seem--... what's the word i'm thinking of? uh, i-- i'm so good at something, that you are now...
...bad.
'cuz if it's the first one--
--i'll shut up...
...but if it's the second one--
okay, fine, new rule, then: if it's the first one, we're good. but if it's the second one, it's the opposite of good. it's, um...
don't butt in, lerrence.
okay-- will all jealous parties just vacate the room? or i'll make-make the boom.
hey, it's a living!
deal!
oh, hey jake.
have a good one.
oh, yeah!
oh... no. oh no.
i can tell ya... but then i'd have to kill ya!
it's... just a t-- forget it, okay? my cousin leron jacked the pamphlet from a dentist and tried to slap these on herself.
himself, i said.
turns out, he couldn't. wuh-oh, no surprise there. leron's a coward and a thief. good thing his buddy travin was right around the corner, and he fixed me up right good! only problem is: he's concussed.
sittin' in the operating chair, i'm this terrible combination of pissed and scared, kickin' my legs willy-nilly like a jackrabbit over water, but lee and trav were gung-ho about the project, not ready to relent. luckily for me, trav  is a frickin' geezer.
he's a sprightly ninety-three, but doesn't look a day under thirty.
anyway, i kick him straight in the jar.
i wish!
don't pretend you didn't notice, okay? gingivitis, plaque, rotting-gum disease, oral acne, periodontic rosacea...
god, no. nah, i had a--, like, headgear for the first eleven years on earth.
yeah. well, even way before. i even had one of those chinstrap things and, like, a built-in retainer you had to turn with, like, a... like a-- that soda can opener thing?
no, like the thing you open a soda can with.
yeah. right, exactly. a tab. either way, in about three weeks i'm gonna have the brightest set of pearly-whites you'll ever see!
i know.
i know.
i know! so drop it.
so drop it.
bleeding? ...or am i just eating a red velvet cupcake?
incorrect!  both.
i was gonna, okay? but my teeth frickin' kill.
yeah. here we go...
not necessarily...
all right!
 i feel shitty... oh, so shitty
owned!
relax, dude, you got pranked, okay?  give it up for the pranker.
it'swhat, you've never heard of teepeeing?
well, this is a brown teepee.
 relax, dude, it's just poo-poo, okay? if it were bad for you, it wouldn't be in your stomach before you pooped it out!
all right, dr. seuss, okay? if you were just worried that this is, like, a homeless person's shit and not mine, i can assure you... it's a combination of both.  ooh!
 ooh, dangerous!
oh, it's so toxic!
oh no, it's _____! oh nooooo! no! 
 and shit!
it's pudding.
just pudding.  i said, and shit, 'cause it's, like, uh... it's pudding and shit.  like, yyou go to the market, and you're like, i'm gonna get pudding and shit. but ityou're just getting pudding and then shyou're not really getting shit. it's just pudding. pudding and shit.
one log!  okay, i put one log  in there to get the color right, and then everything else is chocolate, okayand i don't even know if i took it from the log section, so you're still being a bitch.
to get the color right, i just said, to get the color
it means the prank is over. so we can stop pretending to be friends.
you're watching drake and amir! not hard.
barely!
okay, why do they call this a high school play? they should be calling it a high school work... 'cause it's boring. 
okay, i got, like, fifty more of those jokes, and if you're gonna nitpick every single one of 'em, they're almost not even worth saying.
almost! ...i said.
no, don't go in there!
what? it's not a movie, okay? there are actual actors here; they can hear me.
heed my advice!
i feel like i'm directing it.
cut! sorry.
hey, which one's your cousin? i wanna heckle him.
then she's not your cousin! ...she's your nephew. 
...that's beautiful. 
hey!
i don't get this at all.
yeah, it doesn't explain why people are randomly singing and dancing.
does!
yeah.
what?
it's not music, okay? it's a podcast. check it.

i dunno where i went wrong, man.
it's just, like, one of those things where, like, nobody's specifically to blame.
yeah, well, got people talking, didn't it?
correctly. 
but provocative, like nike's write the future campaign which got people into soccer.
what?
 both i guess.
right...
yeah, just to keep the filipinos at bay.
he's alright, yeah he auditioned, he was just like, i dunno, a lot of it was stuff i've seen before; three ball, four ball, five ball...
great question!  daily show type theatrics only a little bit eh right of center, a lot of smoke and mirrors and political potty humor stuff, with a pop culture slant geared toward skewering the left.
i was gonna swallow a kielbasa and puke all over the front row, like frickin' gallagher or something.
thank-you.
i appreciate that.

 you were kidding too.
 time to seal the deal! 
y'know, i wasn't even sure that we were good, but you reassured me every step of the way!
and if you would've told me two minutes ago that we'd end that conversation in a hug, especially one like this that we both like equally, no way in hell, bruh; i would've called you a coward and a fool.

 hold that.  oh ganked that! false start, unless, did i stick it? i didn't get a good vantage point of it.
i don't know, maybe. it just... basilio says that you lose yourself in the zone, right? you get into like this zone and you just sort of can't really tell what's going on anymore, so maybe i stuck it and i just wasn't aware.
no, i think i did it. i think i stuck the landing too, which is the hardest part, right b?
it's a great thing in parkour, it's a great thing to say that.
what do you know, man, okay? you don't know jack. it is!
yeah, well he's a little bitch that knows less about parkour than you do! 
okay, freestyle walking is all about self expression!
small price to pay for landing it square. help me up!
ahhh!
and amir.
did you?
hey dude, will you check out my album?
you didn't even let me finish!
will you just give my album a listen and let me know what you think?
i, yeah, it's just that i spent like a bad amount of money recording this album and i really wanna know what your opinion is because i respect it... not!
 nononononono what? oh my god, i was kidding, okay? it's like a 'not' joke, and you're crying about it! how is that-
please just let me know what you think, okay? just give it a listen and tweet about it, then maybe, like, facebook about it, blog about it, tumble about it.
that's the least you can do, okay, after i spent, like, a bad amount of money recording it.
okay, ignore me, huh? ignore  this!
right?
this is shit! oh my god, if they botched the entire thing i'm gonna be pissed.
no, this is just what track number one sounds like. i'm just... if the rest of it sounds like this i'm gonna be pissed because i spent, like,
a bad amount of money.
i spent a bad amount of money on it.
it's like the worst amount.
 yo, alright, here we go, here we go, here we go, yo! oh, okay. turn my mic up, actually. can you turn my mic up? i spent, like, a bad amount of money for this recording session, and my mic isn't even up!
 good question. it's called chillin' in the streets: the night diary of amir valerie blumenfeld, a jake hurwitz production.
oh, now you give a shit! for two minutes it's just radio silence, and all of a sudden i give you some credit - one iota, not too much, just enough - and you come out of the wood works. well guess what?
i don't know, man. i don't know what i'm gonna say-
wanna know the worst part?
-that i spent a bad amount of money!
i have an earache.
who has two thumbs and you're watching jake and amir?
nooo.  
  oh no!  
do you get this e-mail even?
 what e-mail?  look then if you don't know.  don't ask me a question; be proactive, check it out
secret santa e-mail, okay?
secret santa, huh?  more like secret not.
oh this is the worst day of my life since last year's secret santa e-mail.
do you even know what secret santa is?
okay, i'm gonna stop you right there.
 c-can i?
what?
 can i talk?
give a gift: that's my problem right there; giving a gift.  you realize there are children starving in africa right now, right?  and i'd rather punch them all in the face than have to give a shitty ass co-worker a shitty ass gift.
don't sign up.  ah haha!  that's great! except for then i wouldn't get  a gift!  i wouldn't get  a gift and i  want  a gift!  i just don't want to give  one.
whatever, man, i'll just giftwrap a piece of garbage and give it to an employee, i don't care. 
 wow.
almost 30! 
i know, i know.
i'm starving!
thanks for calling me your baby.
jake.
jake out of a hat then.
 okay, giftwrap garbage for this guy if you don't let me choose again.
 no.  no.  no.  no.  no.  no.  no.  no.   oh.  mmmkay.  
i can't even read the small writing, okay!?  let me choose again or i'm gonna cry. 
aw i'm his baby.  gotta love me.
stop telling them what to do!
nah.  stop!  
bad gift!  given by a bad man!
a bad woman than.  a wolf in cheap clothing.  
boo!
she already has that!
you do now!  she has it now!  how can you argue against that?
she has it now!
  jeans.
i got excited.
yeah, my d, 'cause i'm tryna get it kissed.
what?
it's called a blumpkin, alright?  i already pooped myself so the blowy's in root.  
what about you?  you should put some mistletoe on that cameltoe, huh?  make the girls scream ho, ho, nooo!
whoa!  it's a petition signed by everyone in the office that says we want you out of our lives.
thank-you, thank- you!  
whoa, a lasso!  kinky!
  giggity gigitty.
and giggity goo.  
jake!
you're ugly to me never.
why do they call it a soup kitchen? it's not a soup and it's not a kitchen.
it's not a soup, though!
trust me, we're good.
believe you me--
i didn't either.
i did too.
heyyy. you know i feel like soup is just a bowl full of ingredients mixed up, blended right, and served to order.
yeah, they can wait.
what?
huh?
what? 
what have i touched in the last week that's considered unhygienic? 
i'm low-balling it!
okay, i'm trying to score some extra cash on the side! you think i'm just doing this for the pussy? 
oh come.
no soup for you! ahaha. i'm just kidding, though. keep walking.
it's a joke! it's from jerry seinfeld. hey, follow me on twitter. 
what? at me!
i feel like this is a public shaming of me.
if it makes you feel any better, i washed my hands in the soup. 
right in the frickin fresh batch of split pea. how's that for a shit me? i served this country too, man! i served it soup! huh? you wanna see my id? it says not welcome! 
you sound like such a tool when you say stuff like burner, man.
nobody talks like that! okay, now we have to clean up, too? how is this fair? 
oh my god. mr. comeback's got an answer to all my quick little jokes, don't you?
nononono. okay?  i wanna hang out. i just don't wanna be helpful at all. jesus. tis the season, right?
you're watching jake and amirand now you're not.
fudge.
oh my... oh my god! no! no! it was perfect!
you gotta be kidding me with this! it was perfect! unhh!
facebook just jumped the shark. okay, they had a perfect game going and they overdid it! okay, trust me, i follow a lot of design tumblrs, so i know when i see things that are overdone, and they overdid it.
it's different. which means it's bad. which means i'm pissed. okay, the big three.
no, i've kept quiet till now, but i'm gonna make a facebook group about it.
i deleted those groups!
newsfeed, yeah.
it was garbage. yeah, they jumped the shark.
yeah, that group was partly political.
and guess what? it filled up.
straight up, they jumped the carp, when they lost the graffiti wall. like...
 yeah, facebook jumps the frickin' shark, okay? every time they have a perfect game going and they fricking sell out! they jump the carp!
he started. he started charging, seven bucks a pop.
he didn't, because enough people joined the group!
oh my god, the facts are in on twitter: facebook was perfect but they just made it myspace! no!
 yeah, cause it sucked!
garbage becomes perfect over time as you get used to the garbage and forget what made it so bad. like, you don't get the internet and commenting in general, so it's not even worth saying
yeah, you know why?
cause they jumped the carthe, yeahthe shark, exactly right.
are you talkin' to me?
it was fine.
how was your break?
yeah, are you just sayin' that to make me jealous?  cause it's working.
yeah, i wasn't home for but two minutes before the old man offers me a grilled jizz sandwich.  curious, i say yes, and he chucks a cast iron skillet at the back of my face.
the back of my fricken' face!  yeah, hit me square and crack goes my weasel.
so i say nope not this year, not again, i'm better than this, and i book it like a librarian as my dad threatens to move.  only problem is, uh oh, mommy's lying supine underneath my back tires threatening to sue me if i run over her head like a fricken' coconut.
my hanukkah wish, didn't come true cause my old man is just pushin' the hood of the car beggin' to the only god he knows to run the bitch over and i'm ridin' shotgun with my hand on the e-brake while the old maid is in the back fricken' planking underneath my back tires, kissing the pavement, begging me to fucking run her over too.  i'm crying like a coward up there right, screaming it's a set-up, it's a set-up!
i was asking myself the same question when my dad popped a squat on the windshield of my rented kia sorento and tried to drop a deuce.
yeah! tried.  turns out he didn't have to go and the only thing he could muster was a little bit of pee and a shart roughly the size of a dead tadpole.  looked like a mud-covered slug and stank like a pug.  so i flip on the old windshield wipers, throw the sorento into drive and crash through my parents garage.  flip a u-bang and i start humming to myself ?silent night?.  only problem is i'm sad as hell.
but i figure hey, 'tis the season who doesn't love a second chance so i swing by the mall and buy my dad a two thousand dollar watch.  yeah, a gold roly-poly for that oldy-trolly.
oh no is...wrong!  yeah, turns out gold isn't his color because when i get home the entire house is gutted, empty, and there's a note on what's left of the door that says here died a happy family, rip, thanks to you, amir.  can you believe that?  callin' me out like that?  rawdoggin' me in front of my girl.
oh that's another thing.  i brought home a thai whore just to show my dad that i had a mate in life.
he means well.
how's this for a happy ending?  new years eve eve, december 39th.
i get a call from a jail in fresno saying that they locked my old man up and threw away the key.  i'm alone, not doing anything anyway so i toss on a wig and hoof it down to the 'no to bail his ass out.  he pretends he doesn't even recognize me, his only daughter!
i spend another 15k trying to bail him out of that alabam slamma' and he tells the bailiff he'd rather rot in hell than owe that son of a bitch coward, me, a fricken' dime.  wanna know the icing on the cake?
me and my dad made up and he's coming to live with me in nyc, the big crapple.
i thought so too, but he promised to make me a grilled jizz on day one.
cast iron skillet, yeah, right to the back of my fricken' face.  but at least i have a dad.
i'm talking about pat.
that's it, huh. no "hi"?
you said "hey" not "hi!"
whatever, right? whatever. isn't that what you said?
i'm a brownie, okay, you can either deal with it or not.
deal with it.
options are for closers, alright. i gotta move a hundred and fifty boxes of thin mints and it tastes like chocolate-covered toothpaste, but a brownie's gotta do what a brownie's gotta do. and guess what? this brownie? she's gotta do.
do you mean that?
thank you.
read the sash.
i have more patches than a frickin' rodeo, man.
i don't know, probably!
i officially don't care.
yeah! yeah, it does, okay? but it's a reminder for me to not be such a bitchly! i'm a little ashamed about it but i keep it on!
what?
no, i'm keeping it-
to me, i'm like, always here, but every once in a while you just say "oh, stop with that voice."
 no that's not even-
okay, yeah.
i'm starting to hear it a little bit.
here's a tip. every five year old in my chapter? yeah. their dads are  dwwiltfs.
dads whose wife i'd like to fuck.
 why so serious?
dammit. shit. uhh, yeah. i went for it, didn't get it. that's... that's gonna happen. dane cook even tells jokes that sometimes don't get laughs. that doesn't mean shit. that feeling never gets old...
don't take a picture. don't tweet it. this lipstick was expensive as shit, too. it wasn't... yeah. this feeling sucks. it was like a total, total gut-check. maybe it's like the beret thing. it takes... it's too far away from the joker that... girl scout outfit. what?
maybe you didn't hear. i'm gonna give it one more shot. 3, 2, 1... why so se-
okay!													
alright, cut.
hi.
create your own reality; don't wait for happiness. you know?
amir cookie, nice.
it's a word of wisdom i came up with, and you're giving me jack shit for credit.
this is sand, okay? i was eating a sand-based nut, a sandnut, so there's cookie sand all over me if that's what you're bitching about.
create your own reality and don't wait for happiness, okay? it is only by creating that that that that that that that joy that you can be in the zone.
no, i said create... what i came up with was create your own reality, and don't wait for happiness. it is by creating that that that that that that that joy that you can be in the zone.
how's this for not sounding smart: i once ate a gay beetle.
it was humping another beetle.
does it matter?
doesn't matter.
hahaha, you're talking out of your ass.
yeah.
it's good.
told you!
a homeless asian dwarf lady gave me like twenty of these on the way to work today.

laundry day! ooh, that was hard.
sorry, just that tuesdays are my laundry day.
yeah, last saturday i thought it was sunday, turns out it was thursday, how's that for a tuesday? talk about the worst monday ever, wednesday.
i woke up on the right side of the bed this morning in the first time in a calender year. spotted a pile of laundry, my laundry and dirty clothes and said haahahaa... not today!
that's exactly right. then i washed it, i dried it, i folded it, and to top that o-
i didn't fold it either, but you're not busting my chops about that are you? you know what your problem is? you bust my chops, and i love you for it.
i'm air-drying okay? sorry.
i don't feel anything, okay. i'm numb... and cold.
i'm numb though too, numb and cold. so numb that i don't even feel how cold i am.
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's true exactly right okay. it's the first time you've ever made a point so legit that i didn't want to punch you in the tits about it.
 changed my mind.
maybe becacuse you haven't even complimented me once about washing my clothes.
i did a good job of washing it, of washing it i said.
it's vinegar.
it's vinegar.
why are you not complimenting me, okay. just because it's vinegar it doesn't mean you're not gonna compliment me.
 here come the waterworks...
yeah i'm waiting for you.
you're the one who's about to.
it's both of us, look at us crying up here like a bunch of ninnies.  everyone turn back, don't look at us two dudes, two grown men just sharing a beef.

 our los angeles itinerary is as follows:
 6 a.m, day after christmas, i put mumbles

because i didn't know until you said it, and then right as you said it i knew!
 tit punch!
ya get one tit punch!
a bonus tit punch for counting the tit punches... like a tit.
 6 a.m: wake up, receive a tit punch.
6:15: triple s, shower, shave, shit.
at the same time.
7:30: tour the canyon, there's a beautiful spot in the middle where you can see the colorado river for miles.  8 a.m: rent donkeys, hire a local jackass, pun intended, to help us navigate...
 no.
 name twelve. and make sure that they're about the grand canyon specifically, not just about any canyon.
i am a shame.
no.
this is a public shaming of me.
this is so messed up. i made like an amazing jackass-donkey pun earlier, and we're just glossing over it.
 it's poking fun at society! yeah okay, who are we if we can't laugh at ourselves?
you know not everyone has these rose colored sunglasses that you do!
occupy baby street.
that's not me, that's you! unless you wanna get... 
tit punched!

hello, hello, yes. uh, i'm gonna need another smoothie, please.  basically, you just need to freshen me up. yeah, same guy in the park. no. no, not the freak-nerd in the net.  i'm a cool guy in a net. so, i can't believe there's a nerd around, also wearing a net. no, i did pay!
if you think for one second i'm gonna pay for that smoothie, you're insane.
now, w-w-wait, ok, what are you gonna do, just throw it away? that's wasteful, it's gonna melt.
yess! oh, and keep your phone on, ok? i'm gonna call you in about 15 minutes for a third. oh, and by the way,  oh, yeah!
it's hard to do that in this net, ok, at least i went for it.
hey.
i'm freezing.
and we're watching you. 
 nevermind, i'll find someone like you. i wish nothing but the best for you too. don't--  
i can sing, i just, it hurts me to hear other people sing. it's like how you can make fun of my mom, but i can't. 
it's 'cause i'm too close to her, but you have a lot of material to work with--she's dumb and short.  we shoulda never taken the freeway, man. zgh  freeway this time of day, zgh, forget about it. killer. 
tzgh.
tzgh.
tzgh.
jgh. 
i'm trying out a new laugh. 
get off here. 
just get off here. my gps says there's like back roads we can take to the freeway. 
i don't have it on me, it was from--just get off and i'll use my frickin' spidey sense, okay? i'm really good at navigating city streets. 
jerk. 
let's just clambake it. are you really a girl?  what is the meaning of this madness? i know. my phone does say gridlock traffic for the next three miles, though. 
oh, is that how long we've been stuck in this gridlock?  laugh! 
lemme just look at your phone. nngh .  hello, 411? yeah, amir here. amir hurwitz. why the traffic? 
she says hold on, but it's gridlock. 
how bout i drop it?
what's the magic word?
be my slave for a month. 
fine what? 
let's just do you're my slave for two weeks, okay? 
for two measly weeks you won't even be my slave? oh my god, i thought you were a bitch, but i didn't think you were a bitch extraordinary! 
 guess what, man? you're my slave now.  oh no! for two weeks. for two weeks! 
that's what she said!
i know you are but what am i?
oh my god, like you've never seen a penis before!

oh! little bitch pricked me a third and final time
how about i got the bitch? how about i got the bitch back!
i'm awake, i'm awake.
oh, you spelled "you're" wrong.
coward!
 okay, what do you think about this for a valentine's poem?  how many words would it take by amir valarie blumenfeld.
  how many words would it take to accurately express what you mean to me?  how can you scientifically quantify how much lighter i become when you enter my day and how heavy i feel when you leave?  how can i describe how my smile just appears magnetically when  i see your face?    how can i possibly count my thoughts of you when i think of you so constantly?  as thoughts within thoughts, within thoughts, within thoughts make it impossible to remember where one began and the other ended.  time folds into itself as i am already nostalgic for our future and look forward to our past.  for the rest of my life, i love you.  
dumb, i know!  
i texted the first part of it to myself while i was takin' a shit.
and the second part, i was mid-wipe so i just said "fuck it, i'll leave it as a voicemail to myself".  haha.  are you crying?
i don't know, i just freestyled it off the top of my dick, probably nobody; i'm gonna can it.  
what?  you already have a card.

whatever.
q, r, s... t, u, v...
no! uh, yeah, i have to think about it.
i have to think about it, yeah but ione second. t, u, v...
no! i'm not stumped, i'm just figuring it out.
yesterday i ended at r; r, q
woah, just got my cousin leron's ezine.
yeah it's an online newsletter.
it's sort of like about disrupting the status quo, sorta keeping the government on its toes and stuff like that.
oo, now you care, huh?
it's called poodle tartar, okay, because he's rawdogging the non-readers.
he only writes it on weekends that he doesn't have to spend with his children.
only 9, okay. but they're mostly grown up now. actually, seven of them are the same age.
huh?
seven different moms, ya idiot! they choreographed it.
you'd be surprised.
this one's pretty messed up actually, it's about 300 pages of bomb schematics and pictures of leron taking a dump on public libraries, which he swears to god is not illegal. and then 
what?
holy guack, i'm never tipping again. what about gifts?
gifts! yeah! you know, for birthdays, weddings, funerals, of that nature.

i can finish it if--
 'will you just go to the bathroom? will you just go to the bathroom?' just once i'd like to go to the bathroom not because he's telling me but because i made the decision myself. jake is chill as shit, but sometimes he's a nerd. i don't even have to go, it's like----oh, oh no. wow, a little gas. nothing to see here! -- . oh no, here we go. ohhh, mmmm, oh my god,  poops i shitted again! wow, that felt big! i'm gonna look down just in a case it's a-- holy shit, yeah, oh my  that's a record breaker. three footer, easy, four soaking wet, two dry, two and a half moist, no coil either, just a straight shot. thicker than a soda can, too. my god, it looks like a boa constrictor trying to get out of a septic tank. i'm a hero and a cool. i gotta snap a pic. w-w-wait! the minute i turn around to snap a pic, the toilet is gonna automatically flush! no! oh my god! stop crying, stop crying--okay, cry, cry, let it out, you deserve this! you don't cry that much and even if you did no one would begrudge these tears! just cry, let it all out, then move past it! okay okay okay, think! think think think, you idiot. there's gotta be a way to snag a pic without getting up. go through your legs.  nope, too dark. it's too fricken dark. ugh, unbelievable. you caught a seventy pound bass and you have to throw it back before  anybody even gets to behold its beauty! good luck bragging about something that doesn't even exist! it looks like ten brown slinkies glued together and nobody's gonna believe a goddamn thing. fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!
no, i'm not okay! i just gave birth to a brown elephant trunk and i'm afraid i'm gonna lose her to the great unknown!
 just stand up! just stand up and do it, you coward! there's no way that log's getting flushed down anyway! no, no, no, greater fortunes have been lost on less risky propositions! you have to be rational here!
jake, listen, it's me--don't hang up, don't hang up, don't hang up, okay? i don't want you to do anything weird, i just need you to come over here and put your hand over the sensor so i can stand up and take a picture of my enormous dump. hello, hello? ugh!
 dildo! he's a dildo! ugh! think, think think think. uh. this is what you have to do. take off your shirt and pants, put them over the motion sensor so that it still thinks you're still sitting down, and stand up and take the pic right away! ha!  this makes me a genius, official genius and a cool. from now on nobody will think of amir blumenfeld as the guy who couldn't take a shit the size and girth of twelve rubber hoses banded together and dipped and brown paint, no! but rather as a pimp and a philosopher. the best two things you can be. 
 okay, here we go, hurwitz. turn around and snag the pic. your life as you know it will officially change. promise me this. whatever people say, you'll stay humble.  i promise.  three, two, one...
oh no! no, no, no!

and yet it is.
ok.
i was trying to change the battery on this piece of junk.
that's an example of something i do all the time.
the hardest thing anyone has to deal with, emotionally, is finding out that a loved one doesn't feel anything for them anymore.
i'm not always talking about apps.
so, you hate the papua new guinean community, i hate the papua new guinean community. so let's just agree-
ok. so this app might be a dud. 
this one's pretty slick, actually, it's an app called burger and you use it when you're hungry.
it's a picture of a burger and, uh, ya eat your ipad. 
barbecue sauce everywhere, no, that was for a different app called ribs and it's not what it sounds like. that was a picture of-
exactly right, how did you-
you're getting defensive.
it's called photobooth and you can use it to take goofy pictures of yourselves.
yeah, well i created a lens for it, called fisheye.
if you're gonna call me out on every single white lie i tell, just, just leave, i'm serious man.
bahh! when i'm done!
what noise?
i guess so- bahh!
you're in a bad place right now and i feel like even if i pitched you a good idea you wouldn't be into it.
 alright.
oh my god, i have a case for it, relax.
call me out. call me out in front of all your big friends so that i can feel small. 
don't compartmentalize me like i'm a chore. 
 i hate when we fight like this.
alright, so this one's a hoot and a half.  what's the hardest part about reading?
ok, never mind.
never mind, i said!
you try to put everything in a box. and if it doesn't fit, ya throw it away.  i'm sorry.
so you know how instagram sold for  one billion dollars?

let me make you an offer you can refuse. heh. i'm writing it down on a slip of paper and let me just know if this offends you.
okay i will take your silence to mean that you've accepted my counter of eleven dollars a month plus carte blanche access to your business center, that means you can't kick me out after midnight!
hello? hello? mm. locked down another apartment dude.
moving is tough though, my current place is kind of a dump.
it's the dump. 
i'm looking at one listing which is particularly cherry. though on the contrary, it might be an apple, because it is that of my eye!
i'm speaking of course of your seven bedroom quadplex overlooking central park west, asking price 38.9 million dollars, so let me do you one worse. five dollars a month plus carte blanche access to your business center.
yes, that is a very lowball offer, but if i'm doing my math correctly-
you are still netting a cool 1.9 million dollars in commission. which may not seem like a lot to you but i live in a god damn trash heap so try not to rub it in my face. i already do that enough as is. 
my last landlord was a coward and a thief. aka: me. that's right, you're looking at a modern day robin hood, i steal from the bitch and give to the whore. 
neither do i. alls i know is that i can't afford first and last month, or any of the ones in between. uh oh, i am blowing up.
yellow is the color of my energy, hello?
oh, good call.  hey wanna do mimosas after work?

i have a proposition for you mickey. yes, how would you like a new roommate my friend. that's right. that's right i am quiet, i am clean, and just between you and me, i bake a mean frittata.
how does 4,900 dollars a month sound mickey? that's right, that's first, last, and security mickey. we can finally start that organic garden mickey. that's right, just me you and some fresh basil, just the way we always wanted mickey. alright excellent mickey, that sounds great. that sounds great mickey, come outside. come outside and help me carry in this boxspring mickey it looks heavier than it is mickey. are you outside, are you coming outside mickey? 
you know why i'm not there mickey?  because i'm not coming. i'm not gonna be your roommate mickey. i live in a god damn trash heap and your rent was too damn high. your mom's bringing us iced tea in mason jars?  well that doesn't sound like my dream! that doesn't sound like my idea of a good time mickey. hold on, i'm getting another call.
oscar the grouch speaking. that's fine! that's fine i will vacate your trash heap at ten p.m. because you know why? i'll be looking down at that trash heap from central park fricken west for five dollars a month in a fricken business center!
he is, he's a freaking coward. i always said that. i said that from day one, that he was a coward.   
cheryl cheated on todd.

that's right! i once shot 3 holes in one in a row it wasn't an accident either, the killing.
i am a monster. on the golf course i take no prisoners. also i will never un-see that child's face. every blink is a reminder and every time my eyes aren't open she's just in my minds eye, taunting me. . bleh.

just give him the milk!
sure.
by the what?
it's by the what?
what is it by?
let's do it!
i cannot even begin to describe how weird this feels. 
that actually makes sense... because literally a second before i started complaining of pain, i ate a shoe.   
hi, you're watching jake and amir, or as my mom calls it, you'll never amount to shit!
mmmmmph! mmmmph!
 i had a bad day, i took-a one down, i sang a sad song just to turn it around...
it's kinda hard to be sure, i was too busy being bound and gagged for the last 20 minutes on account of all the emails i sent!
yeah, exactly, it's a korean pop song.
and guess what kevin got in response? a heaping helpful of radio silence.
they didn't have to tell me twice.
low blow? hell no!
yeah.
bah, baa! and guess what happened next... my neck was stapled!
worst. day. ever.
yeah. 
i wanted to diffuse the situation!
that's my email signature!}
oh, he got me again! the prick hit me again! did ya see that, with the stapler?!
get out of here, save yourself, i can take it!  ooh, hit me square!
hey, you're watching jake and amir, and you're right, i am a loser.
all right.
oh, yellow, colonel mustard.  yellow, colonel mustard.  hello, turtle mushroom.
i'll take that as a condiment.
nyarr! 'twas a fine costume indeed. however...
coincedence? i think nyarr!
it happened by chance. happenstance. it happens, nance!
oh, really, that's a limerick? because last time i checked limericks were an aabba rhyme scheme.
exqueese me!
ex- no, yes, exqueese me.
i'm saying exqueese me.
ex-
exqueese me.
 first of all, that's a lie, second of all, i was doing it to triple-check the safety of the school, it's not like your parents were gonna do shit about it.
fine, no more bomb threats, adolf.
 you know, in some weird, fucked up, twisted way, i'd actually be happy if people thought that.
no, i'm serious.  in my messed up mind, like i can delude myself into thinking that you called me in a mustard costume and asked me to wear this.
actually, if you want to know the whole truth, i saw a doctor this weekend, a psychotherapist specializing in manic depression and acute schizophrenia, and, uh, he i guess diagnosed me, for lack of a better term, with having these delusions of grandeur and, uh, made it quite abundantly clear to me that, without medication, that you just got punked, bitch! ha, ha ha, these costumes were a coincidence!
no don't do it, it's a trap!
we goin' ham!
this is a charity drop off right, for hurricane sandy?
so i'm dropping off this piece of ham.
it's the least i can do!
that's not true, i could've eaten more, brought less.
what about all these water bottles, are you giving people shit about bringing that?
no, because you hate me!
actually, little known fact, it was water that caused all the damage to begin with.
if you don't accept this ham, i'm going to have no choice but to, to, to throw it away. 
what?! i'm not going to just toss it.
i'm crying!
i'm beefing!
beefing over the ham!
yeah well it's a lot younger than you are!
what am i supposed to do now man? huh? i'm starting to think that you won't even accept ham!
no.
i already set up a fund okay! i'm good on that front!
yeah!
for 1000 dollars, i'll lick my own butt!
this is a shame of me. yeah, it really is...
it's a sh..yeah, yeah i'm
no.
no... i've n...i didn't say that.
yeah, i just feel like the tables are turning not in my favour...
what? the tables are turning? yes it is..
 woah.
bad joke, no. bad you!
okay, how about this? i will give you one dollar back, keeping the four as a go fuck yourself fee for making me feel like shit for donating water and ham!
now, i know what you're thinking, why donate? good question, you don't have to. 
 well i'm just saying, show both sides of the argument!
 that don't impress me much.
alright, before we get started, can we just agree not to scream or yell to much.  i want this to be a footmall match, not a scream fest.
nooooo!!!  oh, i made cheetos for this!
what, do you have a foot fetish, man? heh heh.  i do.
wait a minute, there are bones in this nugget!  there are human bones in this nugget.
nice try!  humans don't have wings.  that is a ring finger if i've ever seen one.  it's a freaking phalange or something.  i took ap bio.
wow, now you wanna know more about me.
i cannot believe i ate people.  kelly, great news, you're now dating a cannibal.
chickens don't have bones.  they have nuggets and beaks, einstein!  
sorry about that.
3rd and long, huh?  my schlong is long.
alright, you know what, no.  social experiment time.  i'm gonna write down a joke on a piece of paper, and jake's gonna say it.  cuz i really think the only reason you guys aren't laughing at my jokes now, i mean, you have some weird fucking vendetta against me or something.  i mean, it's gotta be me, right?  speaking of 'n sync,  it's gotta be me.
fuck this room
alright, jake, here we go, read it.
read the joke.
uh heh heh...wow, i guess we both suck ass at delivering gold jokes, heh heh, right?  unless, is kelly laughing?   no?  okay, she looked like she was...
ok.
ohmygod, ohmygod, change the channel,  i can't even look, i can't handle the pressure!
i know, but i don't know which one gets out the most stains.  is it tide?  please don't tell me, don't tell me.  is it tide, though?
ohhh, tell me when it's over.
heh heh, wow.  you're a chick.  hmm hmm.  let the boys talk about sports, sweetheart.
oh really, when was the first super bowl?
he gets...paid...heh heh.
i already answered your question, so give me another unless you wanna get 
how old is ellie  manning?
pass.  name the first football coach for the giants?
i don't know science shit.  i know history shit, but i don't know science shit.
yeah, but i got a 1, ya fucking nimrod.
nah, that's ancient history.
that is way too recent, that's not trivia.
i don't have to play this game with you anymore, cuz you're clearly cheating, the jacksonville jaguars.
alright, you know what, lightning round, first one to touch the coffee table wins.   ooooooooo!
nooooo!  i just lost to a girl at trivia, and she's crippled.
oh!  i've been pretty into voyeurism recently...watching people, you know, fuck and shit, stuff like that.  spending a lot of time by the window of my apartment with a weird combination of binocs, a telescope and some mirrors.  heh heh.  just getting drunk on riesling, sitting on a stool, with a bottle of viagra in one hand and a bottle of jergens in the other, just waiting for something  romantic  to happen. heh.  some nights when nothing pans out, i'll just wait and wait and wait for a husband to come home and kiss his wife on the cheek and that's enough, i'm like, fuck it, i'm going at it.  i tie a belt around my neck and i'm just fucking strangling msyelf-
i can't- yeah- i'm like out of breath, just struggling-
anyone want a sausage or something, like a bratwurst?
cool, go make it yourself, then.
no, i know, but why don't you go get it yourself?  if you want something, why don't you go get it?  huh?  
it's called the art of being active.  if you want something-
i'm serious.  
right here in my fucking trach.
hey, you're watching me and amir.
erection day, so cast your bone, it's not that hard-on.
because i made a joke?!
you know, in some states, the presidential race is a foregone conclusion, so new york and alabama, thanks but no thanks, you don't need to vote.
then i'd be a genius. okay, convincing an entire state not to vote? i should be president.
barack obama? more like yitzchak osama. okay, that guy's a jew and an arab and you mean to tell me religion has no part in this election?  where are you going? afraid of the truth?
mitten romney? i'm smitten, homney. 
and paul ryan, we are tryin', but nobody's biden their time quite like our vice president, joseph dan quayle.
never said i was.
okay, i know it's a two-party system, but what about the candidate nobody's talking about, mitt romney.
when?
oh, yeah that was funny.
voting isn't hip, but you know what is? a rap, so give me a beat.  politics is a polish-dick so cast your vote on this pink 
censorer! i sense you're a censorer, sir, who censored my words, so rest assured i'm incensed, for sure!
thank you.
exactly right, so, for example, barack hossein osama, wow, yeah, he stands for socialism, and mitt mone-y, ha ha, he stands... for socialism.
oh my god, let me bail you out, brother, so get out there and vote for your favorite candidate today. huh.

candidididay.
candidididay.
oh!
that's okay. yeah, yeah, i needed that. 
i feel like i got it now. get out there and vote for your favorite candidaydiday. when you hit me, something messed me up, man.
oh, i'm in college, i didn't register, i can't vote. wrong!
 that sounds like tea party philosophy to me. 
i told you we could be naked!
oh
is it something i said, or did?
yeah, that explains why everybody's been acting coy to me since 2003
what are you doing here, doobs?
so quiet up, huddy!
no!
now how am i to make fun of him?
mr goose
whoah, short shorts
yes he is!
yes he is!
wow
*monotone* i am a robot, you're watching jake...
okay.
happy post-turkey day, eveyone! who wants 5 liters of piping-hot split pea soup? or, should i say, shit pee poop? *laughs* no, i'm just jok-oh no! ah! *falls over, pours soup on face* argh! fuck, it's boiling!
ah, it's boiling my face and neck! aah, it's so hot! aah!
no, it's not going to do anything! i prank call them all the time!
i do it from your phone!
i crank-yanked them last night with that exact line! i said, please come, i legitimately burned my face this time! they show up, there's a flaming pile of dog shit on my own apartment stoop. got 'em good.
nah, not really. they just left and a huge part of my apartment burned down. can you do me a favor?
i'd like to stay with you in order to recoup from this injury. i need you to be my nurse for a week.
what? you already said yes! how could you take it back now?
yeah, what is yes! why would you want to know what the favor is unless you were going to do it?
no! hell no!
this is unreal! this was your soup!
i made this soup for you, right? i called you last night and i said, if i brought in leftover split pea soup, would you have some?
exactly! and then i said, if you're not going to have it, then i'm just not going to bring any in, and you said fine.
no, fine as in yes!
are you actually yelling at me right now? i feel like i'm being burnt alive in a cauldron, or a bowl of hot soup was dumped on my face.
*sigh* i'm starting to regret this whole plan.
i figured if i scalded myself on my most important organ,  my face...
for most people it's heart, for me, it's face.
i figured if i doused myself in hot soup, you'd want to bring me in. show me some tender love and care, y'know? maybe rent some dvds from blockbuster media. i would even eat some leftover yams that you would offer me. i don't really like yams, but i wouldn't have the heart to tell you.
i hate 'em. i hate yams!
....yams.
no, no, i don't want to do it like this. i don't want that pity invite!
this isn't about me.
that is not fair.
okay, y'know what? i accept the pity offer. you've made me feel like shit, and so i will accept the pity offer, but i will not eat the yams.
i will not eat the yams, amir!
...yams.
aah, god, this isn't part of the yam plan! yam plan, thank ya ma'am!
very cool.
are you mad at me?
that's not what i said.
i agree. look, i'm sorry i couldn't respond to your text messages as to whether or not you should buy those pants, but i was with my mom.
my mom was in a car accident and so my entire family was with her in the hospital.
look, i'm sorry, i don't know what else to say.
thank you.
yeah, it's just so weird to see this - 
huh? no, it had cell phone service.
no, i had cell phone reception, i jus-
i just couldn't respond, okay, because i was-
i was in the waiting room, yes.
no, i didn't have my dick in my - 
no, i was not.
i was on my phone, okay? i was starting this phone tree, you know, trying to alert every member of my family as to what happened.
i don't know what to say.  i guess i got punked.  it's just that i'm also in emotional pain, too, right now, man.
fine, i ignored the text.
i thought you said you didn't like the pants.
offensive.
can't you just return the corduroys? 
 the hospital's calling me.
i haven't picked it up yet.
fine.  hey, can i call you back? 
i hung up on them!
i told them i'd call them back!
no!
yeah, i might.  probably, yes.
 she's not dead.
hey, you're watching jake and a beard
well, your beard's not nice.
wha? you've gotta be shitting me with this.
this is not how i wanted to start my day.
so the bitch barked a bit!
and for that, i deserve this, this... silent treatment?
silence.
i'm starting to think that i shouldn't have even brought rotem in to work!
that's the name of the pup!
i feared her that day....
she is an angry bitch. but she is calm.
i couldn't....
i couldn't....
i got the mut three weeks ago at a friggin bake sale! yea, how do you like that? i'm sitting there trying to gank a muffin and quesant.
what, quesant?
it's a french word!
so i'm tryna gank a quesant and steal an empanada-
-when all of a sudden i'm attacked by this, by this, by this-
-this beast outta hell. she starts gnawing at my ankle and biting on my thigh meat and i thought, i have to have her. i said, look, no ones gonna love you, including me.
i had her in my basement for a fortenight 
saying your name loud and my name quite, huh?  nice.
no! and don't say anything, okay?
that's a spoiler!
 yes! that's a spoiler. to say, that's insane it spoils the experience.
i know, but now i feel like someone's going to die or something.
oh my god!
that sandwich looks really good, actually.
give daddy a bite.
what?
you're going?
what did i do?
 what? i asked you for a bite of your sandwich? oh no, i asked you for a bite!
yeah, daddy. it's a joke. it's a joking nickname. 
on my god. you are reading so much into it. 
 okay. can i have a bite, bro? can i have a bite, cuz? can i have a bite, aunt? can i have a bite, uncle? can i have a bite, nephew?
unacceptable?! to say bro? are you kidding me? everyone calls each other that!
 bro is fine, okay. so we're on the same generational level. so why don't i give you a list? i'll give you a family tree and you give me a pre-approved list of what i can call you and what i cannot. daddy: x. mommy: x. bro: okay, that's fine. cuz: that's fine. so everything on my generational level is fine.
i'm angry? you're about to leave!
because it s- it was not even sexual.
 i guess now it grosses you out because you think it's a sexual thing.  give daddy a bite. give daddy a bite. i wasn't even saying it like-
 what? because i'm saying it's not a thing makes it a thing? okay. so, this is not a computer. i guess that makes it a computer. is that how it works?
 i want to drop it but you're turning this into a bigger deal than it already is!
what?
 oh my god. veins in my neck. ooo. wow. they're gay too. i guess you're freaked out by them because they're calling you daddy. 
so you're going to leave?
 you're just going to take off for the rest of the day because i called you a nickname? how's that going to work?  oh sorry, i'm going to work from home today. yeah. amir called me a thing. i guess i'm freaked out and i don't want to be here anymore. if that freaks you out. if that little amount of stuff freaks you out then maybe you shouldn't be here maybe you shouldn't be at work. because in this environment people call each other nicknames all the time!
 i got it.
 i guess daddy wins!
2011 y'all!
it's called butt chugging, and last time i checked, it wasn't disgusting.
by amir  blumenfeld.
number nine, that's wine and dine! a chardonnay and a fish fillet, blend it up, dinner and a drink, now that won't stink.
to each, her own.
i'm the life and death, of every party.
number seven, is levant. that's right, i soak a full body bread in a jewish rye bread, and this ass, gets fed. aka, you freeze the loaf and chisel off little suppositories that you stick inside your ass all night like little tic-tacs.
yeah!
number six, it's for dicks! take a capri-sun straw and stick it in your urethra. with a reverse piss, you can't miss.
with honors, sir.
number five, p. nomwar? more like p. yes. - lar.
woah
no?
it didn't.
number four. one tequila, two tequila, three tequila, sore. ow, if your anus ain't bruised all night, then you ain't funnelin' right.
number three, you and me. sippin' on some english tea.
oh, no, no, no. we're sipping it through our assholes.
number two, how about some yoo-hoo where you poo-poo. that's right, it's already wet and brown downtown, mamma mia, that's some diarrhea!
no.
how is that your call to make?
that's so illogical to me.
yeah.
not fair.
i'm almost done with the list.
number one, have some fun in the sun hun. bring your ass to the beach, and flop it down like a leech. put your knees by your ears, but don't feed your butt beers. not vodka nor gin, no those can't go in. spread your butt cheeks wide, stick that funnel inside, now wait for the tide you're going for a ride. you're a full grown guy, with a tight brown eye, so make sure your lips are sealed, and your rectum is peeled. which alcohol is best, for your asshole that stretch? not red nor white, nor captain morgan's delight, no. what will save the day? oh you don't say? it's: drum roll please.
a simple rose.
thank you.
not 'till i celebrate, , with a number nine.
hey, you're watching jake and amir, unless you're my parents in which case, you're never watching it.
yeah
i like that you called me a buddy.
what are we playing?
nooo, you can't physically force me to leave, so let's figure something out.
ahh, please don't!
fine.
doubtful.
fine.
good.
 oh no, i can't play.  ah ha ha, yeah, i just wanna be here next to you.  that's fine.
wait, before you guys start...
it's a question.  i wanna ask a question.
you mean did you speak it.  you can't talk it, you don't say did can talk it, you moron.
does anyone want sandwiches?  there.  that's my question.  god forbid i ask it!
oh what a surprise, streeter wants a sandwich.  oh wait, that's not a surprise.  the way he's bigger than anyone else is that he eats sandwiches more frequently than the average person.
ten dollars, everybody give me ten dollars.
i'm buying them.  i just don't want to pay for them, you grammar nazi.  who here thinks i'm right?
i like word play.  i've always been the kind of girl who's been like hmmm, i don't know, can you go to the bathroom? heh.
i like this one.  her skin's a little greasy and her eyebrows are way too thick, but she's fun, and i think she likes me, too.
it was then that i realized i was narrating along the entire time.  did the grease princess hear what i had to say about her eyebrows.  we may never know?
my mind was racing.
yes, he is very big.
okay, give me one more chance!  give me one more chance!  if i make one joke that makes everybody here crack the fuck up, then i get to stay and play.
because if i don't, if my joke falls flat, then i will leave you alone for the rest of your life.
 when there's something gay in your neighborhood, who you gonna call?  nutbusters!

well clearly you don't have a problem being filthy! right? i have footage on here that shows you not having a problem being filthy, and i can go back upstairs and friggin' upload it!
thank you, ace! thank you.
alright. three, two, one, action!

uhh, well, good news and bad news, heh: good news is, you get to jump in the river again! yay! that was... fun. the bad news is, due to a camera malfunction, the, um... the footage was sort of lost. not human error--
n-- ow! stop-- high-fiving my-- face!
yeah. i'm gonna delete it... either that, or i'll do you one better!
naaah nah n-nah nah nah, nah naaah nah n-nah nah nah, nah naaah nah n-nah nah nah, nah naaah nah n-nah nah nah, nah--

kick me while i'm down why don't you?
i just got a letter from myself. sent to me when i was 12 years old as part of a sixth grade class project where every student was supposed to send a letter to your future self. turns out, every single student sent a letter to me. yeah, 28 different letters that all start out with the same sentence: i hope you're not alive to read this. how do you think that makes me feel?
wrong! ...like shit!
oh, this one's a gem, alright, you're gonna love this one.
that one's from the teacher!
ms. nesbit actually, she would have been pissed at you. 
you want one from a mean tween though? meaner than you've ever seen? well i got one for you, mr. bean.

he ditch-ditch-ditched me.
actually, one second. where's the hostess? let's call her over; she saw the whole thing.
fine.
actually, what's her name? i can just call her over.
perfect. jessica! jessica!
you're... hurting my fingers, honestly.
jess! hi. i was just telling, um...
that's when you say your name, sweetheart. it's called flirting.  you saw when my best friend left, right? after i told that good joke?
look, i knew you thought it was funny, didn't you? for an off-the-cuff one-liner?
um what?
 it was fine... no it was not fine... it was good...  okay, tell it like it is. all right? obviously i wouldn't tweet it. i have a very unpopular twitter account: usarice. follow it if you scare!  moo ooo ahh ahh ahh...
do you honestly think he should have left, though? over one joke?
granted! okay? but that's almost enough out of you, so please... proceed with caution.
and that actually is enough out of you. thank you so much, jessica; you're trying to be nice, but you're giving me a legit migraine right now.
 it's my birthday today.  wow, suddenly the customer's always right! i'll have that martini for free now, and as for the steak, i think... no, in fact i know i'm going to be eating it off your ass.

oh, i didn't run.  took a cab to work; i was just, uh, asking what time it was.  12:19.
what?
6. idiot.
what do you think my biggest weakness is? correction: was my biggest weakness is?
no.
no exercise gear, exactly right.
no arm warmer.  no tank.  a lack of zero compression pants.
i went to sports authority, and i got calm.
my life has been a whirlwind ever since passover. yeah, my dad gave me a hundred dollar bill to go fuck myself with.  luckily for me, they accept that at most sporting goods stores.  ow.
not yet, i'm a triathlete.  as in, i'm trying to be an athlete.
i'm actually pretty depressed about all this shit.  i feel like i can't get my act together at all.
i spent the better part of a g of not my own money trying to make my old man proud.  turns out the only thing he could be proud of, is that his son is a piece of shit.
i like to make people laugh, you know?  except the only problem is i'm the only joke in this room.  and what's so funny about a grown-ass loser?
that's true. 
thanks, man.  i needed to hear that.
hey, everybody: get a load of these pants.
oppa gangnam style!

very cool!
oh. she is hot.
ooh yeah, she is...gone!
absolutely.
ohmygod i'm an idiot!
 hey, body shots!
 excuse me, are you a capital one card?  cuz, what's in your wallet?
she must not watch commercials.  that's not on me.  it's a product of the dvr culture that we live in!
fuck if i know.
oh, i most certainly did not, i do not wager.
bull shite!
 please do!  this entire conversation is based on a false premise!  woah...swing and a diss.  heh heh.  was that wager for real, though?  cuz if so, you owe me a g.
 girl, are you a volkswagon?  cuz, drivers wanted!
 wow...another dvr girl... you can't fast forward through life!
 hey, who do you ladies think is better looking?  me, or my boy over here.
you're wrong.
okay, bad news bears, i think we have to go, as i was pepper sprayed just now, not once, but thrice in what i thought was a unisex bathroom.
it's good to be the king!
it's not a joint. besides, i can afford it.
shit.  really? i don't wanna get in trouble. not today.
now that i'm a rich bitch, i can buy anything i want.
yeah!
great question!
how many almonds would you say is the perfect amount?
i wanna know.
i am the proud owner of onealmond.com.
huh?
lemme rephrase that -- how much do you think google.com is worth?
and onealmond.com?
zero dollars or zero billion dollars?
 how much would you pay for court seats at the yankees? gun to your head how much would you pay for court seats to the yankees.
how much would you pay?
what, why?
invading your space?
what is it about one almond that's just perfect?
don't just say nothing. cause it's not just a domain name, i'm building an empire.
almond.
ok you know what? no. how about no. for once, you're gonna tell me what you really think. cause i'm a god damn genius and i'm tired of feeling like a chump in your eyes.
you mean that?
some billionaire real estate mogul called me this morning -- he's building a luxury highrise on one almond street and offered me 1.5 million for the domain name, let alone the pic of me with that cashew or whatever the fuck.
either way. i felt like i was sitting on a goldmine, and now my notion has been confirmed by you, my best friend. so i guess i have you to spank for that.
but i must. i must spank you very much.
thanks, will!
you're right, will. it's not your place.
you diva! you prince! thief!
not for me it's not.
actually it's ceoh- yeah! mr. mr. greenberg to you.
take a seat.
 what's bothering you kid?
well i'm kind of your boss. right? and what you're doing is kind of affecting your performance, so unless you kinda tell me what's kinda private, i'm gonna fire you. and not in a kind of way. in an actual way.
oh?
stop it, alright, meryl, listen to me... your-- your life is over.
and not in a good way, not in like a lets start over kinda way, in a, uh, i might as well be dead kinda way.  welcome to hell. population... two.
lemme ask you what does the old boyfriend have to say about this?
wow gay name.
why are you afraid of that? why aren't you sure that he will? i mean, i'm not afraid of the sun rising and setting tomorrow because i know it's going to happen. right? you know what else i'm sure of? you're gonna raise that baby by yourself.

it's a joke, jake, okay? i can't set it up and knock it down, just play along for once! god damn it!
who do you have as your write-in candidate?
exactly right. it was a trick question.
trick question i said! as in he's a tricky little mouse bitch who can scamper his way past the elite eight. i'm not saying i'm proud of the little rat diva but i can say i can see him doing it! also, don't look at my sheet! look at my sheet, that's a cheat! thats a dq!

i really think that the diva mouse can take it this year, this crazy little shifty mouse.

yeah, i know it's not quite there, i was just hoping you weren't listening.
oh, syracuse winning it all, huh? bold!
no, i love that pick. especially because it's 2003, right? carmelo's still playing basketball? we just killed saddam hussein, so that's a positive.
what?
so, george gets a town, louis gets a ville, and what does little ol' amir get? nothing but a public urination ticket and a slap on the wrist. that's not fair.
whoah, great news! in your world, itunes just launched, that's a great investment opportunity!
why would you? i'm sure the governator, you know arnold schwarzenegger, the new governor of california would endorse your pick, especially if he just got finished watching finding nemo, the new pixar flick that just came out!
how do you know so little about basketball?!

it's actually kinda silly.  i woke up late??
whoa! you said you wouldn't interrupt me!
can i talk?
are you done?
can i speak now??
i'm boiling. maybe i can join you in your ivory tower for just a couple minutes, and that'll help me cool off. or i can hop upon your high horse, and we can go for a ride! you know what? i got this idea from having a conversation with my cousin leron, not from a "television show," as you astutely observed.
secondly, yeah! i became fur-obsessed! you know, it's my nature to take things too far; some people love me for that.
 oh!
a little bit, yes, because i didn't think you'd get that personal.
i became blood-hungry! sure, who wouldn't? and who wouldn't feel a little bit guilty after strangling a scared iguana? obviously, animals can't...  talk! but this little guy was begging me with his eyes for mercy. i don't know if you've ever seen an iguana cry before, but i know for a fact that i have.
and as for your last point, i think i will go home as this has turned into a public shaming of me! adieu!
they're ravens.
they're... doves.
hey you're watching bill and ted
well i am!
 i'm coming out so you better get the party started, i'm coming out i'm coming..
okay? i'm better than okay, i'm gay, best part of my day, we're officially now husbands with each other
i saw your facebook profile pic dude, with the eh the pink minus'
no they were like two dashes
no the two, the dashes that are like...
whatever...
i forgot...
either way, since we have to get married gay, i thought i'd...  i thought i'd have to snatch
i thought i'd had to snatch you up before some other beautiful bow out there did
oh my god, i feel a fool
who is he?
 at least give me the curtsey of telling me his name so i can curse him at night
wwwwwhat are you talking about
mmmmm yeah it does 
mmmmm then why else would people be so pissed you nim-rod
the conservative right, yeah, they've been vehemently opposed to this issue, and you know why, because they are forcing people to get gay married, i mean i wouldn't want to be forcibly gay married to someone unless i knew someone as chill as you that i would down to settle down with...
...maybe start a family with someday...i know i know someday you have a career
that's why i'm marrying you
jesus...that's fucked up
who are they to tell us how to live our lives...
ahuh...like hell we aren't, you're my best friend
hohohaha aren't you mr confident, no wonder you found a husband so fast, hey tell me? is he a chubby hubby like the ben and jerry's flavour hahha
whats his name!!!!!!
agreed, except for me and you evidently, you know my mother was right, congradulations jake, you're married to a divorcee and a fiance
you know i thought so too much for three hand jobs and a bottle of nytol that drag queen down in the west villages was singing a different tune
and yet here we are...officially wed  till death do we shart...ho yeah 
 it's natural baby
it's a coincidence
here comes the tadpole, just one, little, guppy, flying, out of my, rectum, ohhhhhh, hi de ho, ehehaha
can you believe that you have to be with this ass for the rest of your life,
that's right there is nothing funny about sharting
that's right we share the freeways with them, subways, office building, schools...they deserve the same rights as we do...sharters do...
and there's a small chance that nobody will come to your funeral.
 whatever.
...jake.
...call me jake. 
i have a feeling you'll be calling me all day and night. to thank me for the gift that i got you when you open your drawer and find it.
you'll look before work! you'll look before work or i'll take it back!
that was an idle threat you ingrate! open the fricken drawer! open the fricken box!--
 right, it's great!
you know how you're always like, uhh, "what time is it?" 
well, it's time for me to get you a new watch.
fffffuck off for not laughing at that, you diva-- you diva little--
--i'm sorry, you're a cunt!
i'm sorry. i'm sorry for that it was obviously a little too much.
you're right, what are we doing? this isn't us!  oh.
what's psychotic is you trying to embarrass me for caring about you too much.
and the messed-up thing? i was pretty fricken close.
 no. i don't mistype.
poetic license.
it's supposed to come through in the performance.
bad writing huh? nah. 
...bad you!
try it on! do me the courtesy!
we all know you have notoriously small wrists.
then i can return it
yeah and you know what he did?
 cried tears of soy, yeah, exactly right!
really? okay, here we go, 'cause look at this! 
yeah!
i'm cryin'!
tears of soy!
 oh, i'm beefing! i'm beefing soy!													
jake or amir, you mean.
right...
hallelujah? nah... holla me. yeah!
me?
yeah! uh... totally. the junior--? which one's the junior conference room?
absolutely! are-- you sure you're gonna want me there? i mean, don't get me wrong, i'm thrilled. i'm just a little... thrown off, is all.
no need! three-thirty's actually better for me 'cause i have this cardiologist appointment that i'd hate to push...
fine, okay, i'll-- ...yeah, i'll make things work; i'll shuffle it around. i just have this pacemaker thing that i need re-calibrated; it, like-- ah, it kills me.
cool. yeah, cool! nah, you're right. absolutely. i just-- i'm really close to death, but... totally. what should i bring? this is my first meeting.  a fruit plate? what--
of course! i'm just excited about the meeting. alright? in fact... permission to lead it?
yeah. alright, yeah! and i will be there too! i will be there leading the meeting! then it is agreed-ing.
don't tell me how to conduct my own meeting, alright? i'm now the leader! and i'm not bringing a fruit plate to my own meeting only to be told how to act by some-- some underling, some college drop-out!
apology accepted! but if you don't want someone yelling in your ear, i suggest you put down the phone!
no you won't.
what? "what," like i'm not gonna be there? no... "what" like you're not gonna be there.
don't worry about it, "bro"!  go back to watching wrestling, "bro"!  go back to eating chicken nuggets out of your brother's asshole, "bro"!
don't worry about it...
 ..."bro"! yeah.
how's the heating in this meeting? if you're wondering why i'm asking, it's because i'm... jake, what are you doing here?
of my own meeting?  gee whiz, jake! i'd rather not!
treason! this is more than a coup d'etat!
where i got the impression was from you, ya coward! in fact, you guys are all cowards for listening to this snake-oil salesman.  ...get him. i'm sorry, jake, but-- guys, get him.
...off with his head!
you'll leave in a body bag, ya benedict hey-arnold! unless that's not your style, "bro"!
nyatch oo-wruz ib yadgerg ream--
i wasn't trying to!
ho-ly wow! congrats, bud! we're rich!
oh wait-- we're actually not rich at all! 'cause zark fuckernerd has us bent over a table, owning every single photo we've posted to instagram! i'm sorry, pal!
"okay"? no way! instagram's new privacy policy claims that it can and will sell all of your photos to the highest bidder!
what am i talking about? i'm talking about you don't own your shit! do you have any idea how dangerous that is, okay? that's why i posted this paragraph to my facebook profile which should stop the bleeding for now while my lawyers look over the fine print. actually, give me your email. i will forward you this paragraph and you gotta copy and paste it precisely. otherwise they'll find the fuckin' loopholes in it, i swear to god they will. those micey, micey bastards.
actually, better yet, don't even give it to me, 'cause i fear that my email is being monitored, hacked, or worse: both, by king zark himself. yeah, he's all up there, trollin' around looking for paintings and shit, art that i have in my head.
yeah! i'm being thomas-crown-affaired by the facebook dictator himself! yeah, he's makin' his way into the art museum of my brain while i sleep, crawlin' around, makin' his way out with billion-- nay, million-dollar ideas for paintings and shit?
"i saw the greatest minds of my generation destroyed by madness. starving, hysterical, naked, dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn, looking for an angry fix!" do you know who said that?
amir blumenfeld!
 it's working! don't you get it? it's absolutely working! he's pitting brother against brother!
ginsberg! zuckerberg! all these frickin' jew billionaires! don't you get it? i make these instagram photos for me! i write these facebook statuses for me, so that if one day, let's say i want to sell them, that should be my money! that's my prerogative; that should be my money!
i'm saying if i want to approach a-- a huge brand, like a doritos or a coca-cola--
they like quirky, cheeky, irreverent humor.
do you watch the british office?
i'm serious, do you watch the british office, with richard gervais?
all's i know is that last night i had a dream of a painting, and today it's the friggin' logo of the facebook! okay? is that just a coincidence? are you really that ignorant? are you really that fuckin' blind?
fine. fuck off, alright? have a good life! good luck being classless, assless, deaf, and dumb! you know why? 'cause facebook's robbin' ya! instagram's rapin' ya! and myspace?  it's givin' ya the old how-do-you-do! 
you know what? here.  here you go! you deserve this. hey guys! listen up, good news! jake's now for sale! make sure to make your check out to zark frickin' dinkenberg!
...hah?
okay, okay. you've made your point. relax. you'll-- you'll make a martyr of me.
 what, buddy? i'm sad.
 i just-- i don't want to delete it! it's, like, the best website ever, and-- and instagram is the tightest app.
 okay. yeah, you're right. and i'll take 'em down from the inside.
noooooo!
hey, please enjoy this very egg-cellent episode of jake and amir!
eggs!
he saved the goose! what did i tell ya?
mm. yeah, that makes sense.
no, it is. can i paypal you the money?
fair.
oh my god.
you-- no, you are, and it's starting to b-- like, it's st-- it's--
it's-- it's enough, alright? i'm getting really pissed off about it.
say it to his face!
ours!
ugh... i don't know if i can make it, man.  like, the finish line is in sight... but i'm not right.  what time is it? four am? five am? 4:05 am?
stop hounding my shit, please, okay? i'm pissed, i'm scared, i'm tired, i'm... there...
there.
 i'm glad you asked.
holy guac! that nap was more than legit: it was dec'!
don't nitpick my twitpic, ya shit-dick! now that wit was quite quick.
i'm clearly awake if i'm talking to you, scooby-frickin'-don't.
bad scooby? nah. bad doo.
 dude, you gotta crack up at that shit! that scooby-doo pun? that destroyed at my pop-pop's wake.
um, 'cause everyone was sad? especially me! i was his closest friend! open casket? now i can't buy a basket.
you just did it!
oh, an unintentional rhyme? well i'm an unconventional mime,  eating an unpresentable lime.
eww!-- fuck you. crack up at that.
fuck you, fuck you, i'm cool, and fuck you.
ohh! oh, it hurts to laugh, it hurts to laugh...
...and fuck you.
oh, you'd love that, wouldn't you?
wow. the truth comes tumbling out. jake's a frickin' anti-semite. and that just ain't right.
i said "you, jacob hurwitz... you're an anti-semite."
 i'm talkin' about you hating jew.
get him!
 tear his... jew-hating face off.
...gimme a hug--
oh my god.

i am stoppin' it! i'm stoppin' the war...  on drugs!
 hello, 911? yeah, i caught the bitch! he is alive and well, for now! nah, he's not even an underling; he's the head of this frickin' operation. i just chopped the head off the frickin' snake!  this serpent beast-- yes, i'll hold.
 yeah. hello?  okay, so i got a stolen wallet here, a... a-- a burner cell...
...and keys, that i believe were used... in a murder-suicide!
and eureka!  i found it!  we're looking at a kilo, kilo and a half of that colombian mud!  this is mexican grade-a shit.  you chose the wrong bull to tangle with, compende?  okay, here we go: selfie for the insta!  hashtag... hashbag.
i'll ask the questions here.  ace hardware.
they're gonna throw the book at you, you know that? and you know what else? i'm gonna let 'em! 'cause i have a lot of pull in this court system-- don't ask me how or why.
a judge ran over my face when i was six! want to know the saddest part?
that i used to respect you. and now i know the truth about you... you're a drug.
if i'm a loser, then i'm the biggest loser! because truth be bold, i've got a quota to hit this month, and i am very much so under! ever heard of bein' on thin ice? well it is springtime, my friend, and i am swimmin' in the shit! i guess you could say i'm up shit's creek... with a paddle.
ho-ly shit, you must be dumber than you look. i gave you a get-out-of-jail-free tard and you're throwin' it back in my face!

and it worked! ...yeah!
yeah, but--  have you ever, like, gone to the gym and forgot your shoes?
forget-- i knew you wouldn't get it--
i knew you would just hang me out to dry, because you love seeing me fail! right? the germans call it "schadenfreude".  americans do too! it's funny: we were enemies for so long, but we still use some of their phrases. c'est la vie!  that's french, but you get the poi--
if you're a hero...  then i'm a zero!
how'd you like to know that i got a free iphone out of the whole shebang?
kinky! 
...do you think i have a case?

"--ick creams", yeah!  okay, number one--
...asshole.
what if we sell gift certificates that you have to accept at any store?
yeah, exactly! we sell cash, for pennies on the dollar! 
but ya gain pennies! 
you know how people love juices and smoothies and shit?

"d'ahh, don't call me that; call me rob! mr. people's my dad's name." 
why don't me and you, we open up a frickin' pottery store, huh? how's that sound? some choice pieces at first, but then we'd build up our inventory, start franchising some stores?
that's the first smart thing you've said today.
i'd like to run a 401! your frickin' retirement fund for a price, but first,  how'd you like to open up a pottery store with me?
ever heard of a nutritionist? well i'm an oldtritionist! pay me to eat a weed!
call a doc-- call a lawyer! i'm gonna sue whoever put this clip in my throat!
okay, it's called-- it's called a digital tip jar! for any online transaction you make, the tip jar forces you to round up to the nearest dollar and takes that excess change. it returns it to you at the end of the year so you feel like you're making free money! we make one percent off total transaction costs, which seems pretty negligible, but really starts to add up the more clients we get!
that is a dummy idea i stole from my entrepreneur friend clovis!  i knew you'd shit on it!  isn't your face redder than a beet! ...speaking of beets,  do you got a garden? i'd love to eat a weed.
yeah, great idea. let's take a-- let's take a hard five, go outside, get some fresh air, come back in here with a renewed sense of purpose to tackle the second half of the list--

"...fireworks for me! head down to the local docks and watch the red, white, and blue o'er the land of the free and the home of the brave! our ancestors fought, bled, and even died for this country, and the least we can do is take a moment to celebrate their effort, to cherish what we have. even if life isn't perfect-- you know, 'cause let's face it, whose is?-- just sit down and reflect. you know, you can make anything you want for yourself, and that's what america is; that's what makes it the greatest country in the world!"
"number two: take a poo. right down there on the docks that you've been reflecting on, too! george washington, you dreamy, dreamy oaf. now lay down, open your mouth, and swallow my steamy, steamy loaf."
...excuse me?
okay,  uh, "number one--"
 please let me finish.
you're upsetting me, dude--
 uhhh, whoa--  --something's happening. i can't even-- i don't even know if i can finish the list at this point, because i am  short of breath or something!  what d-- what d-- what d-- what did you do with this-- you put some weird, like, hex on me or something--
 no, i'm more than crying! i'm like--  i don't know! it's indescribable, i'm like... 
 no, n-- what is that? what is sobbing? i'm like--  --scared--  --and-- 
 i can't go home; i think-- i think i'll die in the subway, i'm like--  ...what did you do to me? you witch doctor!
 yeah! that's exactly what it is! you demon! you sorcerer! what is this black magic--
oh... thank gosh.
that was...
"--have fun in the sun..."
...gimme a hug--
oh my god.
hey, you are watching jake and amir!  that was funny!
i don't know...
i'm sorry, do i have swag?
and enough said!
exactly, the fact that you didn't answer right away with an enthusiastic voice yes means obviously i don't!
hahaha...wow that's the nail in my metaphorical -for now- coffin.
i'm a serious jude, i eat at the chillest restaurants, hang out with the hottest guys, and yet i don't have swag! you know why? cause of my frickin' jew nose and my two beady jew eyes.

this is so dumb!
it was j-crew!
i am serious dude! i honestly feel like god owes me money at this point for dealing me more than a shit hand. and i am not talking about being paid back karmically, like with a good career opportunity, or a love interest. i am talking about him! owing me! cash!
yeah.
watch out.
agreed. with two buck teeth and no ears!
oh, bullshit, you are just trying to make me feel better.
yeah, i agree! also, i have not one, not two, but one infected nipple ring!
no, because at this point, i feel like you'd just say it to shut me up and it wouldn't mean anything because you didn't say it originally!
for real?
yah.
thank you. actually, that means a lot coming from you, believe it or not i, uh,  i don't know, i'm kind of weirdly obsessed with you i guess...hah, so for you to say something like that to me, i don't know--
i like it, i guess.
i appreciate it.
 cause i got swag
it was a stupid, stupid song.
i made a dumb, cause i thought you'd cut it off, there's no end to it, it's just-- it's like, uh-- i barely wrote it. it's basically like, uh, this and that. the tune is-- i can't do the tune now, because i'm like... about to cry, but the lyrics were the weakest link, they were-- it's so dumb, why do you make me do this? it's hard to say without the tune, which is actually, pretty tight, but i can't do that because i am sad as shit. it was  i got swag... i got swag... tell the world that--
it actually feels like a, uh, burning sensation in my chestal area! 
hashtag swag!													
and  i dream of california--
sorry.
 gotcha!  ahh, , bitch!
what?
swallow your pride!
relax, dude! it's a meme!
you're not gonna make me feel bad about this.
'cause it was a joke! have you ever heard of pushing the envelope? oooh! have you ever seen hall pass?
no, i just realized i rented it yesterday from a redbox for a buck, and i don't have a place to watch it.
y'all just got punk'd! 
whoa! who threw the scissors? not cool!
okay. you know that guy eats his own shit? why aren't more people talking about that?
...i hope you die next.
 excuse you? yeah, excuse you? ...yeah, excuse you!  ...what are you talking about?
i said i hope you die next!
i'm serious, man, and i have a weird premonition about this kind of shit. i mean, look at this last text message that i sent amanda.
yeah, but i didn't know that!
prove it!
 it's called a mm!
the rest... is comedy present, past, and fut--
ohh! ...aaah!
aaah!
aaah!
aaah!
oh, did it get me?
aaah!
aaah!
aaah!
aaah!
aaah!
alright, trick, don't kill my vibe.
i'm serious!
i'm on a bus and, it's going fast and...
that's not how the rap goes.
i feel like busses are for people who can't afford shit. like whips and shit.
yeah well except my dad had an audi. so thanks for playing!
yeah, he really did, he had an audi!
no like he leased an audi. leased to own an audi.
oh no, lock me up and throw away the key!
really? that's bad news actually cause i wouldn't last a day in jail.
it was a goof!
excuse me. i have very thick skin but that was a low blow.
enough!
this is what's up. this is why i don't needs to rides the bus.
i flaunts it cause i don't needs it. and i don't give a sh- oh! oh no!
it's niggers in paris. niggers in-
do you know what that means? i feel like if you knew what that meant, the sixty-nine thing, you'd be cracking up.
not the number, ass. it's a sex thing. okay, it's when a girl eats your butt. sixty-nine.
you're poor. you're poor. y'all are poor. and i'm a rich bitch.
i'm not a bitch. i'm rich.
how's your summer been?
fine. i knew you'd give a fricken' one word answer and i knew you'd say fine, and to prove it, i wrote it down on a piece of paper before i left my apartment this morning. exhibit a!
other side then.
wrong note then.
wrong note i said!
raise your hand if you think i have social issues!
why are you rehashing this shit? alright, i was there.
so you don't have to repeat it okay, just move on!
move on! move on! move on!  move on! move on! move on!
hey, welcome to jake and amir! when you're here, it's like every--
yeah, okay. sorry.
 make way, for shia the beef! 
 hey, you! clear the way! it's an a-list star! yes, you! out of the way, it's an a-list star!
i'm just flustered because i'm around a frickin' celebutante! yeah, shia the frickin' beef, in the flesh! you're looking at a quadruple-threat, motherfucker!  film star! movie star! tv star! and guess what?  he's got an instagram!
not yet, but you're looking at a social media team,  and you'd better believe that's top-notch number-one priority.
not for long!
i don't even know why i'm talking to you right now! you're sitting in the king's throne! up, or off with your head!
no! nonsense, sir! and i'm really sorry you have to see me like this, but please, jake! immediately! get the fuck up! this is shia the fuckin' beef!
"mike fink", right? "john doe"? okay? we don't have to use alii. we're friends here, and shia, by the way, you're not foolin' anyone, okay? i can smell megan fox's naked box on your bated breath, and guess what?  it tastes good!
don't tell me what to do; only one person can tell me what to do, and he's standing right here. 
then i won't.
chia the frickin' bean! get it right or pay the price.
now do you believe me?
yeah!
low blow!
hell no! shia, please! enlighten the man!
...wow!  ever humble, even though this motherfucker starred in holes, then went on to fill up megan fox's holes! i'm serious, dude! you gotta tell me about that shit! i want the deets! i have such a crush on her.
wow, jake's never been to hollywood, nollywood, nor bollywood. and it's clear to me that megan fox jumped on your jolly wood, and rode that dolly good!
i will! and i'll help him work; in fact, i want to be your johnny drama and your turtle. if there's anything you need, i'm your man. i might be a vegetarian, but tonight... i'm eating beef!
that's actually a good point: we should release a sex tape.
no no no, something tasteful at first-- you know, a little kissy-kissy, a little anal-- and then, when people aren't ready for it, boom! we hit 'em with the big one! we're viral!
kissy-kissy!  kissy-kissy!
...oh.
hey, you're watching jake and amir-- oh! my nose is bleeding.
yeah, but this time it's, like, for real!
what are you doing?
what's a bid?
why are you pledging a frat?
my country's a cunt.
you called it a frat first!
stop it.
i know. stop it!
how does it get you paid?
how does it get you paid?
no, you said paid, and made--
...paid.
no.
isn't there, like, hazing and stuff?
so what did you have to do?
jesus! why?
holy shit!
did that hurt?
why, why, why!
no, i was just reading it. y-y-y.
why don't you just call him on your phone?
you mean dick-tooth.
hey, you're watching jake and amir, and if you see my dad, have him call me! 
want to know a cute little life-hack?  if you're interested.
it'll save you time and money, let alone effort, and... did i mention c-c-c-c-c-c-cash?
every time i fly, when i land, i'll pen a little complaint to the airline that flew me. you know, i'll come up with something like, uh, "oh, they denied me a drink", "oh, the food wasn't vegetarian"-- whatever miscellaneous hogwash pot-pourri comes to my crazy brain-- and like clockwork, within a business day, they're reimbursing me with a fifty-dollar voucher, a hundred-dollar voucher. i can sell that on the secondary market.
and proud of it!
stop it!  okay? a-- a "thank you" would have sufficed, for saving you time, money, effort, and let alone c-c-c-c-cash!
well i'm not most peoples!
enda-- no, more than endangering! i've actually taken a pilot's wings before. i mean he wasn't fired, as it were, but he was definitely forced into an early retirement! i'm actually locked into litigation right now, so i can't speak with too much more detail about what's going on. 
we're nine months deep and i do not have the capital to sustain this frickin' law & order: sv-fuck-u! i have been grilled by several expert witnesses and a lot of professional cross-examiners, and i'm just sitting under oath, lying through my teeth at this point!  i actually broke twice! yeah, i couldn't even keep a straight face. my own lawyer left the courtroom mid-testimony.
it is a shit-show! i'm so heavy in debt, but nobody wants to take this on pro-bueno! seriously, i'm two million in the hole, and at this point i have to win the frickin' case just to break even! how is that normal? how is that fair?
oh, they rob us.
yeah.
no, have you-- have you seen these fares? they're gouging us!
have you seen erin brokovich?
have you seen erin brokovich?
 well i'm erin choke-a-bitch!
 what?
why?
i don't know if i want to. this is ridiculous!
i can't hurt you! i can't punch you!
i'm sorry!
 you a--  you assh--  oh--
 hello? ...what? ...no, no-- esquire, sir, with all due respect, that pilot touched me! 
hey, you're watching jake and amir! see, i told you we didn't need jake. wait-- you're not still recording, are you? ...noooo!
ahh, thank you streeter! please don't eat me!
"nice"? you mean "rice", or so you wish!
so!  the name's amir, but you can call me jake--
--and, uh... who here has a guess as to what my talent is?
no. okay!
stop that.
jake? help?
my talent is slam poetry, and my passion is sticking it to south america.
"uruguay: you are a gay."
"p--" okay-- "peru: p.u."  and, uh, "brazil: you can--"  "--go to hil." ..."go to hell." okay, feel free to not hold your applause to the end.
"nicaragua: i need more agua." ...so.
it's south of america, and i urge you to stay silent until i'm done.
"jamaica, mon: how 'bout you make a mon? or are you too high?"
how is this fair? okay? i was the one making fun of other people, and now, like-- they're making fun of me!
i have several more, each one funnier than the last, but just by a show of hands, who wants me to stop?
okay, who wants me to stop, but sort of sees that there's potential in this idea, and with a mentor and a page-two rewrite, can actually win this frickin' talent show?
sheep! you guys are all sheep!  moo, moo...
...and especially moo.
hey, you're just watching two handsome dudes do what they do.
why?
relax, dude, i'm on vacation, okay? don't make me regret traveling with you.
alright man, you said something nice i appreciate it, now stop talking before you ruin it.
let's just go to bed okay? lights out.
aah.
yeah. just, uh, it's just dark as shit. trying to find the bed.
and give up! you'd love to see that!
no no no no no no no, i can do this!
either way, challenge accepted, and completed! 'cause i just found the bed.
har har hardly. which is why i'm about to turn it off! aah! it's hot!
i thought i had to walk through it to get to the bedroom!
why? why, so you could say i told you so?
we can go to bed. you're the idiot, 'cause i just found it, and to prove it, i'm gonna fall backwards into it, right now.
grunting
missed the bed by a quarter foot. worry not, crawling into her right now.
here we go.
just getting my bearings straight, loser! arrivederci!
wow, my hand sucks now.
yes sir, just a close call. worry not. here we go, leaping into bed, one time.
room service?
no.													
and?
wow, way to be ambitious!
ha! this is fun. just two best friends watching hotel television together.  we both cherish this shit.
oh my god, congratulations! it took you thirty seconds for you to make me feel like garbage-trash today! that's a record!
and the shit just keeps on... 
that's right!  diva! 
hey, let's go swimming.
hot tub?
come on! traveling with you is such a bore. what do you do, just sit inside of your room and jerk off all day? 
so we can't even spank it?
can i hold the remote now?
oh, here we go, it's story time! hey children, gather 'round; it's time for jake to tell us a tall tale! please, jake, remind me what happened next!
 hey, room service? yes, can i get two cheeseburgers, one with fries, one with salad, and can you take that entire order and shove it up your butt? that's right: go fuck yourself! you've just been punk'd by ashton coutchard! ha, i wouldn't eat your pig slop if you forced me to butt-chug it!
oh, bullshit. they did say 228, but i guarantee that's a lucky guess.  yup. jake hurwitz speaking.
it's electric!
boogie-woogie-woogie. 
enough! absolutely no more!
 garbage, fake news, reality trash, propaganda, propaganda, the weather channel... skinemax? 
you really are becoming a thorn in my side.
 room service? hi. yup, room 228-- no no no no no, don't hang up, that was-- my boy got a hold of the phone earlier, and you know how kids can be. anyway, we would actually like to order lunch this time. do you guys have, like, a small seaweed salad? maybe like a quinoa starter of sorts that you could just roll up into, like, a... like a torpedo and shove up your ass? like, just shove it up your goddamn ass?  that's right! my name is jacob penn cooper valerie blumenwitz and you were just the victim of a jerky-boys-style stunt, aka a flash mob!
did you instavideo that?
ass!
 hello, room service? no no no, i'm sorry, please, no no, don't hang up, don't hang up. that was my brother. he's going through these-- i actually am calling to apologize. he's going through this, like, pha-- it's not even worth getting into. we actually-- i know this is hard to believe, but we really do want some food. i feel like the boy who cried wolf, but if you can just find it in your heart to-- to believe me one last time, i really w-- i'll make it worth your while. i'll pay you 200 percent.  gosh, thank you-- thank you so much. i so-- i so, so much appreciate it.  i don't have a menu on me, but if you have, like a-- any spaghetti dish, like a pasta, like a penne vodka, something tomato-and-cheesy, that you can shove up your ass! that you can shove up your goddamn ass!  hello? hel-- oh my god, you gotta be kidding me! that's like the third time they hung up on me!
oh my god, dude, dude, dude, you gotta get that.
 please, please, please! i'm so sorry for prank-calling the hotel! you really- i don't know what got over me, but you can't kick me out! you really cannot kick me out! i deserve to stay here! you don't understand, this is like a vacation for us; this is like a once-in-a-lifetime frickin' thing--
 i'm not going to apologize; it was a joke!
 got 'em.
yeah.
 hello, room service? yeah, can i have, like, a soup, and can you shove it up your, your goddamn-- yeah, your goddamn ass. thank you.  they would. they said they were going to.
ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls.
i was done.
though if you ask me? we already found our leading lady.
we gotta go through the whole dog and pony show of at least seeing everybody, but i assure you it is more than a done deal i think we can all agree. promise us you'll keep monday open?
cancel it. sweetheart. please. okay? you're as healthy as a clam. we will call you.
never. holy shit, that was awful right?
next!
how does it feel like? i'm serious, how does it feel like?
i'm serious. i musta been to like, what, a million of these?
and i've only ever seen one person ever have it, as much as you currently do. okay? and uh, elisabeth shue turned out alright.
i want you to walk out. walk out right now with your head held high because you just won a goddamn beauty pageant and a talent show all in one.  there she goes, miss americ-no. that was... what was that? next!
yeah, you jessica rabbit meets jessica biel a-list . patricia? do me a favor. remember this moment. can you do me that solid? can you remember this moment? can you remember this time and place? can you remember what you see and feel? okay? because this is the last second of your life that you are in a goddamn a-list fucking .
yeah. i want you to take the scenic route home. i really do, i want you to waltz downstairs, go to the book library, the food store, whatever the fuck it is you do, and i want you to soak in  breathe in that privacy for the last fucking time, because after this week, after the people see what the performance that you just gave to us for the first time, and honestly, i feel treasured that i got to see it first, your life, as you know it, is completely changed, and i don't think everybody can handle it but i really think you can. because honestly? you're a goddamn elisabeth shue to me. she is. like i know i've said it before, but like, now i actually mean it. thank you.
you more than got the part! you got our hearts. namaste.  and more importantly. we've got toilet paper. for our farts! thanks patricia! ha ha ha ha ha ha, wipeout!
dammit.
i'm aloof!
fine. relax.
nothing.
i called you a queen. and you know what? sure all these girls might not have all gotten the part, but you know what at least they felt like a star for half a minute. and yeah, they'll come crashing back to reality when you tell them the truth, but isn't it better to have loved and lost than to have never loved at all?
i'm aloof!
geez, relax!

good question.
after a year of inner turmoil, some deep reflective thought, and a lot of, um, light soul searching, i've decided to finally heed your advice and delete my reddit account, so... salut.
sorry... what?
yeah, haha! sorry.
yeah yeah yeah, what were you saying?
good question.
no.
it's subversive!
i'm sorry. i had no idea you were a circlejerking diva, when were you gonna come out of the closet on that one?
yeah. exactly right, i'm glad you see things my way! my way or the highway!
exactly right.
oh, really?
i don't know if you saw this, but it was trending quite worldwide on twitter, last week, this loser? went dickless for michael chiklis. so. i don't know.
i'm a good guy greg.
i am, i am a good guy greg.
no, it's not! take it back!
the comments were helpful, and i appreciated them.
to which i zung'd him back!
to which society dealt him more than a fatal blow.
and counting!
didn't need to.
you know what, enough. okay? i already regret even bringing up the fact that i was gonna delete my reddit account because quite frankly at this point in time, i don't even see me having the huevos to pull it off! i really don't!
and?
yes.
a thousand?
no, i know.
yeah.
yeah.
yeah.
uh huh.
oh yeah.
am i really on the front page?
my name?
on the front page of reddit?
a hah hah hah hah hah hah. yeah! woo!
today i learned that i'm a pimp and a cool! upvote me to karma heaven baby!
wow! recording intros without me-
touche
hey! what's the capital of cleveland?
what's the capital of cleveland-
ooohioo!
let me answer your question with one of my own.
what was the worst part of my face before the surgery?
my jew nose.
well now you're really not gonna have a problem with it. please allow me to reintroduce myself, my name is nose.
n to the ose e!
well, you know my cousin leeron, right?
...anyway, his ex-boyfriend, parm...
yeah, dude, it's 2013, why is that of note to you?
yeah, he has ki- uh- i'm sorry, no-
so gay people can't have children, is that what you're saying? is that your little agenda?
no, i'm serious, if gay people having children freaks you out this much-
then you have a lot of soul searching to do
yeah, you really do.
you have to look yourself in the mirror and you have to say: do you deserve children?
because i really don't think that you do.
parm fancies himslef an amateur surgeon- a, a bone sartorialist if you will.
anyway, i'm in the market for a new schnozz, you know, and the price was right at five-k plus gas.
did i mention that the hospital, was a van?
if you thinks it's legal, i've got a news flash for ya!
general anaesthesia, general,  i need no anaesthesia. i was clubbed on the head like a stunned cow before slaughter. i fell into a deep fitfull rest, fevered nightmares of birds eating my face and what have you. but, listen up because this is when it gets real.
i shoot awake mid surgery, you know i guess the club  didn't do the trick. heh, anyway, long story... shart...
i wake up in a cold, cold sweat to the sound of a bone saw cutting through by bone cartilage, nasal cavity deep deep deep into my skull and i'm like, you know what? no! enough is enough! i take a scalpel, blind old parm and i am out of there. unfortunately, for me, i'm too weak, tired, scared and lame to get much further than the front of the inside of the van. erstwhile, parm is on in the back, rufflin' around, swearin' to the only pagan god he believes in that he's gonna have my head in a jar for what i done to him, re, blinding him with a scalpel.
let me work it, ha ha.
it was nerf ifinifin when yet and you're not even cracking up-
yup, a smile.
if you're talking about blinding parm then you should know that he was nearly blind to begin with, okay? if not already there.
oh, speak o' the devil, he he. parm's hospice nurse is calling me.
ninety-three.
it's 2013!  hello? yes, no no no, okay maam, maam i can assure you he was blind as a bat already. you are not putting that on me! hello-? if parm wants to talk to me he can talk to me himself. oh hello mr sir. yeah, you know what? no- you are a chicken, you are a chicken parm! you are a god damn chicken parmesan!													
and my lucky number is sixty-nine! 
okay.
oh! got a spell of good news in an otherwise... quite shitty week.
i don't have to be nice to anyone anymore.
yeah, well now i'm rich about it!
ever heard of the lottery, jackass?
well i just found out about it yesterday!
either way, i just won the goddamn jackpot! so call me whatever you want. 
 enough with the name-calling!
i'm serious.
i'm not trying to! it obviously itches like a bitches!
either way, i'm serious about the lottery thing, man. i-- i beat the system on that; i really did.
well, you know how everyone only buys one lottery ticket?
 well i got tree, i got tree, tell the world, that i got... tree! 
ass!
ass! ass!
you wouldn't have laughed even if i s--
that's why you're not laughing? 'cause i said two?
or is it because-- because everything i say doesn't make you laugh?
because you have a bias against me.
excuse me?
what do you mean, "first ticket"? they're both the same "winning" combination on each ticket! why win one lottery...  when you can win tree?
the same winning combination!  there's a difference.
1, 18, 22, 27, 38, powerball... tree! as in "i just won the lottery tree times".
i know. i know.
not luck, okay? strategy!
oh, excuse me! what's that supposed to mean? is that some kind of dig at my nose?
i can't handle this right now! i gotta go back to the store and get the numbers on these tickets to match the one on the site!
not right now! but i have a feeling if a guy who just won three hundred and thirty-three million dollars waltzed in there,  they'll pretty much do whatever the hell he asks them to.
it just itches a lot, okay? but it's fine!
 oh my god!
hey, you're watching jake and amir, and if you like that... 
 what? what? what?
jake, can you get that?
oh. thank you! ass!
hello? hey! hey, no no-- sorry, i was... i was washing a bowl. oh! no, you're calling about the couch? unfortunately, she's uh... she is no longer available. alright. thank you. thank you so much for calling. bye, hun. 
no, no no, no, no--  --it's actually a... it's actually a funny story--
here's what i do: i, uh, put a nice leather couch up on craigslist saying it's available for free to a good home. you know, i even peppered in some really believable details, like "i'm moving; i don't have a place for it," et cetera, yada yada.
"why" what?
oh!  no, i just, uh, i like to let people down. i like to hear people's disappointed voices, i guess. i don't know if that makes me weird or whatever.
shit... can you get that?
 ass!  hello! hi. sorry. i was--  ...washing a bowl. how are you? calling about the couch, right? alright, well my first question is usually "why do you want the couch?" ...oh, your daughter's going away to college and she really needs a good couch?  that's really sweet.  watch this!  unfortunately, the couch is unavailable! yes, it is because of how you answered the question.  no, no, i'm not being cute with you, uh... you really-- you disappointed your daughter on this one. alright. okay. bye-bye now. bye-bye then. 
i told her i was being "cheeky".
i said that. i said i was being cheeky.
god forbid i have some fun at work!
yeah, because i don't want people to know my personal number!
ass! ass! ass!

 i'm so serious, man. oppa leads, like, a halloween-style gangnam life and you have no love for it? like... how is that good for oppa?
oppa sad. alright? oppa leads a... a sad-style life.
yeah, he really does.
 i have a dream...

...thank you.
 do you know why i like to eat brains?
...'cause i'm a zombie!
i'm stretching.
 oppa... oppa leads a suicidal-style life...
oppa is confused of himself.
 so this one kind of works as, like, a two-person costume.
skeleton guy, and, uh... whatever the hell you want to wear! 
oh my god, you're calling me out on all my bullshit today. and i love you for it!  what are you, on your period or something?

happy halloween and merry christmas from jake and amir!
all right.
oh! there you are.  where have you been?
 huh?
it's only me over there!  who are you looking to avoid?
oh! let me show you a magic trick. stick out your tongue.
come on! please? just stick out your tongue. it'll only take a second! we never have fun anymore.
have you realized that?
everyone walks around with their button-up suits--
--and suddenly it's, like, illegal to have fun.
oh-- damn it, i'm sorry. i think i messed up. was i wearing shoes?
okay. alright. you got-- you got the point across, you diva! you're overreacting. you're being so dramatic!
got it!  you owe me one, you little drama queen. hey, uh, why don't we have a french kiss and we'll call it even?
oh, yeah!  oh! oh, jake! tastes like sushi!  relax, dude. what's the matter? me got your tongue?  just joking. same thing happened to me last week when leron tried the trick on me. it's actually a lot easier than--
get off of me! ass.  jake! stand back, everyone! stand back! you do not die on me man,  you are not! going to die! on me!
he's alive!  he's alive!
seemed to have, uh... bit his tongue off in the process of hanging out, but, uh... that's normal.  that's gonna happen.
unless...
okay.
 ass.
question: do you think peyton manning gets paid to do these papa john's commercials, or does he just, like, love pizza and shit?
and no answer from the peanut gallery!  salut! so i will just assume--
i know. never mind.
i know he gets paid, ass. it just seems real or some shit, like he frickin' loves the pizza.
forget it.
 forget it because you don't know what the fuck you're talking about... ass!
in the ads, ass, peyton manning is borderline obsessed with these-- these-- these pizza pies! i mean, it-- it's insane, it's sick! he's, like, chowing down on them!
he's gonna, like, choke, he's eating them so fast! i swear to god!
 that's what i'm asking you!
fine.  eli manning for sure loves dunkin' donuts, okay?
that much at least is true!
yes yes yes! for sure, for sure, for sure! whether he got paid for that ad in-- in donuts or money--
 want to know how i know he loves donuts? do you want to know how i know he loves donuts?
do you want to know how i know he loves donuts?
 the proof is in the smile! ...dipshit!
 because he's smiling in the ad! yeah! and people only smile when they're happy. unless... did i miss a memo? that--  that-- that frowns means happy?
which means he loves pizza from papa john's! mystery solved! that wasn't too hard...
 ...ass!
whoa, a billion!
can i quote you on that? no no no, i should email business insider, because hey-- that's breaking news! that's, like, the biggest athlete endorsement ever!
hey everyone, gather 'round! big news! jake thinks that peyton manning got paid a billion dollars to be in an advertisement for papa john! 
 pa-pa-pa-john!
pa-pa-john!
pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa john.
forget it because you're dumb?
you're the ass, ass!
ass!
ass!
 ass!
hey, you're watching jake and amir!
it's fancy!
we should do that again-- ...what?
i'm happy.
this was a good morning for me; first in a while, actually. in fact,  permission to hug the shit out of you, sir?
sharing a meal with you was--
 amazeballs! yeah! it really was amazeballs, for lack of a better term. you know they say breakfast is the most important meal of the day.  try my life.
 ...cool it.
i'm high on you!
 you're right.  i'm sorry-- woo! i just--  --i had all this positive energy pent up and i had to, like, let it out in one-- one, one-- one primal scream! but, uh, okay. now i'm done! we're good--
 i'm rather glad.
pat! my main man!  what'd you do for breakfast today?
i ate with jake! i ate with jake, i ate with jake, i ate with jake, and i don't care who knows it!
 i love that! breakfast club is nothing if not ribbing on each other!  cool it with the name-calling though, 'cause i'm secretly depressed about that kind of shit.
 "hum"? like my nose emits a humming noise? excuse me, but i have a deviated septum about that kind of shit! where does she get off calling me that, that-- that queen, that diva, that roach?
 i hate it when it's used on me. i like it when it's used on other people... dillweed!
 and time! congratulations, you've ruined the warming glow of breakfast by ten am! hey, it's a new record, bud!
 maybe.
and then you'll take me to lunch?
you're on.
quiet, dork!
 noooooooo!
who wants free comedy?
 alright.
hey, check this out. i, uh... made my own bread last night?
 yeah, i just figured, uh, why not?  i've been, uh, interested in that... kind of thing for a while now, so... ta-dah!
 yeah, last night for dinner, i was, uh, jonesing for, like, a grilled cheese sandwich, you know. so i open the door and i just see, like, uh, cheddar?
and i had, um...  tomatoes?
i had tomatoes?
but hey! no bread, so i, uh...  i open the fridge, and i'm like "you know what, jake"--
--"jake, today's the day... today's the day you finally... you figure it out. you figure it out, and you get it done." so, uh... let me cut you off a slice, huh? 
 come on, please? it'll mean a lot to me if you... try a slice!
 i'm curious to see what you think about it.
 whether you like it or not is actually what i'm most curious about!
here you go. careful, it is hard.
sometimes bread comes out like that.
well, it's a work in progress, sure, okay, but there's a learning curve.
that is uncalled for! it is chalky, to be sure, but there are some redeeming characteristics.
enough! more than enough, actually, okay? there's constructive criticism, and then there's this-- this-- this-- this-- this poison that you say to me...
do you like it... or not?
appreciated!
alright, here: try it with some of this homemade jam!  yeah! just spread that liberally on the chalk-- or, bread.  now you have me saying "chalk", ya dingbat!
no-- i don't know how! you said "chalk", and then suddenly i'm saying "chalk" instead of "bread". it's a whole thing.
it is jam! you just press its head against the bread-- not chalk mind you--  and then you use a knife to sort of squeeze its little jam insides out of its anus onto the cha--  bread, oh my god, i hate you!
here! here! give me that-- give me that rabbit jam. i'll show you.
excuse you.
no, excuse you!
give me the rabbit back, my friend.
hey-- hey! get-- that guy's getting away with my jam! get back here, you thief!
oh!
ho ho ho! happy thanksgiving!
sorry!
hear ye, hear ye! can anybody hear me?
 unreal!
 "top ten alternatives to turkey on thanksgiving", by amir raymond blumois!
it's animal cruelty! "number ten: did you know that turkey is a live hen?"
"that's why i'm telling you... to eat a wren!"
"how are you going to have bird love for a pheasant you've never heard of?"
"number nine: feeling swine! what's that jive? slit that piggy's throat while it's still alive. come on, bud! drink his blood!"
"number eight: would it kill you to put some veggies on your plate? a strawberry, a yam, asparagus, or meat."
asparagus! asparagus is a vegetable!
and "yam"!
"number seven: i'm eleven! a throwback thursday to my tweenage years, when my dad gave me three aged beers. child services gave me away, but that very afternoon, gave me right back! turns out i pissed off all the wrong people in the clerk's office. they figured what my dad was doing to me was more than deserved: it was earned!"
"have you ever seen an admitted child abuser get off scot-free? yeah, i wish it happened to someone else... and not me!"
"my dad defended himself in the courtroom, and all he did was stand up, point at me, and say, 'i rest my case.' the loser got a standing o, and then my court-appointed attorney gave him a handy and a blow! two jobs for the price of fun!"
"number six: can't be fixed! but that don't matter, 'cause we got"  "gold teeth, grey goose, trippin' in the bathroom; we don't care... we got something in our hair... 'cause we'll never be royal!"
what?
very nice, asshat. who's that?
alright, good... we're good then.
i'm saying 'cause i'm... just-- leave me alone. i'm busy. christ.
right, i know. just let me finish the list.
dumbass.
"number five: put the car in drive! i'm talkin' 'bout a whopper from wendy's and dunkaroos from the d's! eatin' it in the backseat of your car alone, because nobody came with me's."
..."number four: dave's mom's a whore."
 "number three: jake, please help me!"
"number two: this latch won't do! oh, this hulking ape is more than a chape, and look at me, this frightened queer jew!"
ohh! "number one: what's done is done. i've, i've-- i've-- i've made my bed, and i said what i said. there's... there's a beating that's coming, and it won't do me any good running, so... i guess i'm caught on the can, and i must be a man. do what you must. i accept your blows."  "break my jaw; eviscerate my nose."
"but maybe... just maybe, my bravado is uh... is a-stirring something inside you. there's a kinship here, a-- a mutual respect on a cos--"
hey, you're watching jake and amir, i guess.
you're sad at me!
...hi.
are you... er... i just think i need to go to the hospital.
i'm not... or, i don't know who i am.
 ...yeah?
what's my personality like?
that's fun.
 and so i sit, like...
why are you crying?
i'm just rifling through my pockets, trying to figure out, you know, little hints about my past, and there's, like, this... barbecue sauce container, a-- a clump of blond hair, and this really poorly-worded note.
 "clone jake with his hair if he's ever being a bitchly."  are you jake?
ohh!
...jake... jake... jake. jake! jake--
so i guess this is goodbye.
aah! what was that? jake! where have i been?
yeah, why'd you do that? get him, jake! show him no mercy! what the--
ohh!
ohh!
ohh! stop it, or i'll--  --clone you, you--  --bitchly!
or you can press stop and sta...
i'm just saying, it's an option
aah, dating apps! rollcall! go!
i have 'tinder', 'hinge', 'grindr', 'minge', 'okcupid', 'okstupid', 'whatsapp'..
they're all dating applications, if you know how to be a pimp! 
the only app that's worth a damn on here is 'grindr', i'm actually 10 for 10 on that shit! huh, it works perfectly, if you don't mind who fucks you and where.
not as of yet, nay!
 i'm on 'match.com', but it says i'm 0% compatible with everybody!
like an alley... or... my face.
so 'hinge' is like 'tinder', but it relies on you to have facebook friends, of which i have none!
yeah, luckily for me i fucked the creator at the launch party. huhu
that i went to the launch party?  no!
thoughts on this guy?  would you let him...
excuse you!
i have a 'tumblr' lately. yeah, i reblog hot chicks in the art scene and sort of neg their shit! i say i'm a gallery owner, so they respect my negative opines.
you're just pissed, 'cause it works!
not really, no, but you'd know that when you called me evil, did ya?
oh, made ya flinch!
i lost a nut! how does that even happen, right? i, i swear i'm having the weirdest year. ha
 i was so afraid! i thought you were gonna hit me, but more afraid of the pain. i was really afraid of how that punch would change us. how it would effect us going forward as friends.
actually met a girl on 'myspace', invited her back to my place, to sit on my face. hehe
absolutely not! much to my disgrace! huhu she, erm... she sued me! which...  ...was bad!
na, i just met his wife on 'ashleymadison.com', hu.
it wasn't really that site, as much as it was 'yelp'. she left a not so stellar review on this diner that i frequent, so i messaged her and begged her to open an 'ashleymadison' account. i gave her access to my paypal address and eh, she is not using it responsibly! bitch is bleeding me dry and her husband is threatening me on the daily with bodily harm! i guess that's why i'm single!  hehe
chill! chill with that, those nasty asides!
the trick is to join these, 'cause you're feeling lonely.
well, i'm christian from single mingle...
wait!
wow. okay just cause there's a sombre moment doesn't mean i can't crack wise, can we wax poetic for a second about one-liners and their place in history?
not my friend.
then i'll kill myself.
ricky! objection! leading the bitches!
no!
 hey you're watching jake and amir and you're--
it is a good song!
well... this is it.  it's more than it, actually.
this is goodbye... it's more than goodbye.
 wow.
you're gonna put me on blast for that?
oh? that's a good idea?
to blast me?
on the day i move to the angels?
what?
no possessions? there's a sandwich bag!
it's odds and ends, mostly!
i pack light.
 enough, alright? enough.
it's been ace working with you.
ass, ass, ass for not laughing at that? it was a callback!
i thought we were gullies!
"last hurrah"? what are you talking about? just 'cause i'm gonna be in la doesn't mean that we're not gonna work together anymore!
how frickin' so?
 i know! but we're still gonna be in the same office... dweeb!
congratulations! time! you just ruined my last day on earth here in six minutes flat? no! six minutes bumpy!
in what?
...what is that?
we're driving across the country in an rv?
just you and me?
 wow...  i deserve so much more than... 
 i deserve so much more than this! this-- this... this is your big idea for a send-off?
cool it.
what is that, like, a... like a thirty-footer or some little piece of--
twe-- you might as well have rented a minivan at this point! i'm not going dutch with you on that!
no, no no no, come back, come on, yeah, i'm excited. big adventure. hurrah.
you know what? no no no, this is good. you'll make it up to me along the way.
oh sheesh, y'all! t'was a road trip!
 whoa! okay, taxi almost nicked me.
 on the road again... just can't wait to get on--
wow.
 oh hey there!
 oh, no thanks. i think i'm good!
i butt-chugged a dasani! at the mason-dixon line!
i'm sorry, if i had known you were gonna be a babysitter on this trip, i would have charged you $3.99 an hour and tried to kiss those milky white thighs on your way home!
unimportant.  i've been doing some light map research...
 ever seen midnight in marrakesh? the lights dance on the ocean, and reflect off the anus.
very well!  we'll summer in cte d'ivoire, aka the ivory coast! golden sunlight! silver moonlight! all of it weaving together in a glowing tapestry that tugs at the anus.

why are you being such an ass-cracker, okay? the world is our oyster!
pass, pass, ass. okay? you know, i'm just gonna go to sleep if you're gonna be such a queen roach about it!
i love you so much!
and you? do you love me, brother?
 and in terms of love,  where did you land on that debate?
 let's hit it so hard that we love each other for it!
hurt it so much that it's... lovely?
i love you too.
 your love is taking me higher! 
 no! sleep! 'till!--
 oh, don't kiss my thighs!
 on the road again... just can't wait to get on--
wow.
b'shanah haba'ah b'yerushalayim: next year in jerusalem, my friend!

 i want to eat drugs, roll face, rage face, suck face, fuck face, starting-- starting with her!  okay.  hey baby! you want some beads?
that doesn't matter! if there's no grass on the field, play bald!

let's play a drinking game! never have i ever: been happy! 
 aaaaaa.

never have i ever been to the equator or made anyone in my life smile or proud of me!
do you think i'm funny?
i'm serious! i know you laugh at my jokes,  ha ha ha ha ha, but do you ever, like, sit down a day or two later, and think about something i said, and crack up to yourself? that's the type of shit that you do to me.  that's the type of shit you do to me, i want to know if i do it to you!
forget it!
i guess i'm a two-beer queer! just don't tell my dad. he hates gay people!
say that again! say that again, and i will knock you the fuck out!
talkin' about my dad!
you're clearly too high to have this conversation.
woo!
 ohh, my sinii! take me to mount sinai!
george bush doesn't care about black people.
i'm serious, man!
never have i ever hugged a bitch, been accepted by a bitch, or felt connected to a bitch!  why do you think that is?
ooh, wrong answer. guess again.
enough.
avert your eyes, cornholio, daddy needs a new set of beads! 
i'm actually down to clown with a lady of the night, if you catch my drift.
a janitor! ...ess!
 we are being boarded by armed pirates! we are being boarded by armed pirates!
i'm good.
and my dad hates me, he's got a fuckin' problem! and he won't return my call, i got a fuckin' problem...

you know i've had a shit life, man.
thank you, mother teresa.

where?
hey man. sorry, one second. waitress gave me a tough one, actually!
...yeah?

as the sunlight kisses the majestic vista, our heroes emerge!
okay.
that awkward moment when you realize it's not that grand of a canyon.
and she is canyon. i'm just saying... that awkward moment when you realize it's not that big of a canyon.
i was facetiming with leron back in the states.
and he actually only had one note. it was to add "that awkward moment when" in the beginning, to make it more like a... meme.
i'm sorry.
no, about everything, okay? i've been acting like a real... a real diva roach for the past seven... eight years.
 i actually wrote you a note. if i could... read it...?
 "thanks for everything. uh, i know i've been a diva roach, and, uh, while i respect the shit out of you, i rarely show it. i don't know if you've noticed, but i don't-- i don't have a single friend, and my family life is, um... not. you are the one bright spot in my otherwise dismal life, and even though you get short-tempered with me, i know that at the end of the day, you have my back. i just want to say thank you for that. i appreciate you."
'gramming it. hashtag: best moment of my young adult life.

 thus concludes your tale of woe and worry, but alas, everything worked in the end!  bubble bath! bubble bubble bubble bath. 
 except i burned my finger, okay? if i may be so bold as to ask: how is that fair?
you don't have to be a roach about it!

thank you, thank you, thank you.

because it's worth more than cash! ...ya jackash! one bitcoin is currently worth four hundred and fifty... cash!
which, last time i checked, was still more than the one hundred  "dollars." that i bought it for six months ago, so.
 i love you!
oh-ho, swish!
i am, ya jackash!
...what?
excuse me.
uh... okay...
oh! you're h-- ...you're heavy!
i thought you said you already had bitcoin!
you're hurting my back!
...i'm sorry!
that weird bullying was the highlight of my life! ...jackash!
hey, this episode of jake and amir is a slam dunk! 
swish!
start spreading the 'cuse! i'm leaving duke--
me like arizona, but me have a soft spot in my heart for mid-major darling wichita state!
enough.
creighton barreled their way past bed, bath, and b. young!
brigham young!
anus!
let's see, you got iona, you got iowa... what's next? kentoka? or... yukor...?
winda? or some shit? i don't...  you hit me in the face, dude!
sorry, i'm weird about violence. i just have zero tolerance about that shit. that really fucking pisses me off.
okay. okay! no, keep bringing it up.
for the final four, i'm liking unc and that baby blue!  can i see you pee, and a baby poo?
someone has.  someone absolutely has.
 to strike me like you did showed a lack of tact, and you came off like a classless ass, and that's the facts, jack.
alright, i appreciate your attempt to mediate and alleviate what you've done to me to date, but it's a little... too little too late.
 come on, you little pussy! get... ah! aw, shit!
fill out a bracket, huh? i say fack it! nah!
yeah, fack it.
fack it! nah!
relax.
relax.
fuck.
let's get high. right now. i swear, my picks will make more sense if we're baked!
alright, enough-- hey! no eating! ...no cheating!
 stop!
st. louis, st. joseph... what is this, a fucking, like, a...  ...i thought this... what is it, like, a-- a fucking... 
damn it!
double or nothing, okay? anybody else's dick. any dick.
 alright, so these are them.
our final brackets. let me just file them under "e" for evidence! 
because you're under arrest! 
yeah, that type of shit might fly in nyc, but this is illegal gambling, alright? we don't look too kindly on rinks!
hey, you're not watching jake and amir!
reverse psychology.
it is!
 get this guy out of my country; get this guy out of my life, dude!
i'm sick of this tmz tweeny-bopper canadian lesbo ass, dude!
 it makes me want to puke or something, dude!
 everything justin bieber does is a "blunder", and so i think we should send his ass back down under.
either way, this mongoloid ass needs to be deported for his actions, or lack thereof!
 he's just obnoxious.
 he's just a little obnoxious. he just rubs me the wrong way, in a way.  he's a little johnny obnoxville.
this motherfucker is ruining the lamestream media, with these pop-up, tabloid, e-zine, blog, link bait, listicle bullshit! okay? i can't-- they're just covering his downward spiral; it's disgusting! look, visit my facebook wall. i post about these things pretty often, actually, they're--  --they're actually really funny! they're great! 
i'm serious, dude. buck him! yeah, why does he get all this attention? he doesn't deserve it! just... just thinking about it, literally all the time, makes me sick to my stomach!
yeah, 'cause he's a basket case! he's a car crash, and i can't look away! also, belieb it or not, i'm... i'mma kind of obsessed with this little fucker.
i have bieber fever in a way. okay? diarrhea and all.
i'm actually starting a facebook group.
if you care to join it, it's called, uh, "deport justin bieber before i faint"! 
holy shit, did you see this tmz video of justin bieber pissing in a bucket? 
you can actually kind of see justin's balls in it. it's... it's pretty hot.  i'm sweating.
i'm fine. i'm just freezing, and...  puking a little.
oh shit, dude! 'gram it! 'gram this, and dm it to justin. i have... i have giardia for this tween fuck!
 "hello! you're w--" ...you sound bad, dude!
who wants soup?
i know you're not mad at me, okay, but i can't help but feel that you're a little bit pissed at the day.
whoa! did not expect or deserve that tongue-lashing!
fine!
want to know the worst part?
it's that april fools is like ruined now almost.  not in a good way, either.
i'm just saying that i feel like every april you'll be reminded of this little snafu, and i won't be able to play another epic prank on you without this green cloud hovering over us!
today just got sucks.
i guess kinda i could hear him...
...though murph does raise a good point that it was a little bit masked by, b-- by the, by the bitchly screaming.
i mostly do, but maybe not completely, because he didn't finish the sentence. he was like, "i'm sorr-- aaaaah!"
i don't want him to get hurt--
--though, on the other hand, everybody does deserve a second chance, and maybe another rip will give jake that opportunity.
it's fine!
 so, i got us an amazing real estate agent, who will find us an amazing apartment!
 nobody does it better!
 i told you he was the best!
and a donut!
we can't live in a muffin, you idiot!
what?
yeah.
oh, very cool!
uh, yeah!
that's okay.
oooooh, do it--
uh, yeah.
ooh!
whoa, a raven.
where are they?
work?
moving on!
 this one tastes like glue and paint!
so how much does this place cost?
ooh!
aww.
ooh!
aww.
we don't want to live in a muffin!
let's do it!
i got us an amazing real estate agent, who will find us an amazing apartment!
we don't want to live in a muffin!
it's close enough.
we don't want to live inside of a muffin.
thank you!
whoa, that toilet felt great! it was like a massage chair.
oh, no.
yeah, yeah.
mm-hmm.
 sven? yeah. damn it.
that's so dumb of me.
even for me. that's dumb.
agreed.
mum's the word! we're all on the same page.
no.
don't need to.
exactly.
i know! how amazing is this blueberry sun roof?
it's fun! it's--
it's friendly; it's different.
then get out! if you don't want to live here, get out.
aaaaaah. don't go anywhere.
hey, you're watching jake and amir. who needs jake?  where is he?
oh hey there!
what?
been thinking a bit about poster ideas; thought i could run a few by you.
yeah.
i think i can make 'em funny!
we should come up with a ratings system. so instead of you saying, like, "this is good, this is bad", you'll be like "this is amber, this is taupe".
no no no, taupe is great. amber is just better than that, and if something is ultimate, it's gray.
it's a poster of jordan, right-- air jordan, probably-- and he's soaring through the sky and slammin' it home! 
pretty--
pretty forcefully. is what i was gonna say. don't taint my ideas with your negative shit feedback... christ!
uh, it's a poster of dank weed, you know, like sticky bud, and there's, like, a girl in a bikini.
pretty good. agreed.
huh?
 alright, it's a poster of a clock, right--
--but instead of the hour marks, it's little beers... except at six o'clock, it's a little ears. 'cause listen up! it's beer-thirty! and i'm thirsty!
amber.
see if you can wrap your twat around this one: it's a psychedelic black-light poster for a little band i like to call... the grateful dead! 
that's actually a pretty dece idea. maybe a poster store in the front, a cool cafe in the back, and a little spot to put air in your tires if you ride a bike!
i'm not a businessman. i'm a businesswoman.
it's a picture of a ninety-eight-year-old dude on a toilet, right? caption: "i'm gettin' too old for this shit!"
well that one already exists too! so all this shit about me not selling "originals"?  "you're dumb"!
...what?
i'm actually on the fence about even pitching this one, 'cause it's so, like, hyper-offensive.
but it's a 
...taupe.
so it's a poster so shiny and reflective that it shows you a mirror image of yourself when you stare at it.
yes, jake?
...yes, jake?
dope.
i can has cheezburger?
no, i'm just hungry, and i was wondering if i can has a... has a cheezburger, actually. i... i hasn't has one in a while, and i was... simply... curious as to whether or not i can has one. a cheezburger.
this one's less of a poster and more of a drink, but it's like a... orange juice and soda water.
i-- it's just that i'm starving, and i feel like i can has... a whole lot of food, but more than anything else, i... i cazn't has a cheezburger. in fact, i... i cheezn't has a cazburger in quite a while, factually.
i caz hoping i caz has one. with cheez.
it's called the guide to british smiles, and it's just famous englishmen and pictures of their fucked-up teeth. it's like half social commentary, half me just being a little bit of a dickling.
 wow. 
oooh, i shouldn't has this! i cazn't has this cheezburger! it'll give me bad cholesterol! i can has bad cholesterol?
this one's half poster, half beverage. okay? it's called an arnold palmer!
just tell me if you like it or not!
winning! 
it's a 1988 lamborghini countach, parked on a hill during a sunset, cherry red! and guess who gets to drive it!
heck no! ...me in ten years!
...milk?
you'll never understand my scatterbrain!
i can has my notebook back now?
dad?
alright, just trying to organize my thoughts here. would you say your top three choices so far have been psychedelic poster, milk, and mirror?
okay. that'll suit me well for my first round of funding; the angel round, as it were. by the way, how much could i put you down for? it's a big pie, so feel free to ask for a small little slice.
that fucking hurts to hear.
dude, i am watching out, dude!
learn how to drive, shitbird!
call me a shitbird again. call it to my face and see what happens.
yeah? well learning shit is for aunts and dweebs! and last time i checked...
 ...i'm have a pussy. yeah!
exactly right. can we-- ...can we just listen to the radio? alright? music helps me drive!
i'm sorry if music distracts me! i think that's pretty normal, actually.
 i-- i--i know how to drive, alright? i'm a regular james deen.
what?
i can't... you know what?... i can't see anything. i think i need my sunglasses.
no, i got 'em, i got 'em, i got 'em.
i got 'em, dude! i g--
why am i an idiot? okay? there's a lot of glare. it'll be much safer if i just find my shades!
i don't need 'em on the road, buddy! alright? relax. i--
 beware, beware, beware...
 ...of a woman with a broken fart! 
got 'em, baby!
pussy-whipped much?
i swear, dude. you let women walk all over you. you gotta--
okay...
me neither, so we're both... on the same page, as it were. 
fine.  it's funny... this whole thing reminds me of my old man teaching me how to drive.  was sittin' in the same seat you were. if you can belee dat!
cursing the only god he knew that he lost that rock-paper-scissors match against my mommy. "loser has to teach queen dweeb to drive!" that's what they said.
"queen dweeb". that was their nickname for me. they used to yell it me, taunt me, throw shit at me like the, uh... what's the inside of a-- of a peach?
yeah. they used to throw knives at me.
because you gotta cut the peach with something! ...idiot!
yeah?
 i use arm signals.  hi-ya! less legal, sure--
--but... way less effective, too.
yeah.  oh, god, these driving lessons. daddy used to sit right there; me, crying in the front seat like a five-year-old. "i don't want to drive today, papa! i can't reach the pedals!"
i was four.
excuse me! say that again! say that again to my face and i will drive this car into a cat, so help me cod, you fishy bitch!
i can't see shit, dude! these glasses are not prescription!
 let me put them back in the case!
what, dude! drive, shitbird!
hey, you're watching a very green episode of jake and amir!
what?
work is fun, but i've actually been pretty into hobbies recently, horticulture being the latest. i like... masturbating and shrimp quite a bit.
masturbating might actually be my favorite. 
do we have, um... a hose?
 sorry, can i ask you-- how much a week do you spend on produce?
 i'm serious. how much a week do you spend on produce?
 i really want to know, dude!
wow! ...really! that's... that's nothing! ...where do you shop?
nine.
bucks.
dude.
you know what? i'm sorry, but i'm not going to apologize for having a green thumb!
 believe it or not, i'm actually growing the ingredients one would need to make a salad!
it's, uh, basil, ficus... manure...
yeah. a lot of salads actually taste like shit, but i hear they're pretty good for you. here, look.
 this one tastes like horse manure, actually!
 sure tastes like it! 
 ...what are you talking about, man?
 and?
 so why didn't you say so!
 before i ate it, idiot!
 because it's good for ya, see?
now if you'll excuse me, i'm gonna have some shrimp.
 and if you need me, i'll be in the men's room!
very well, then!
mmm. saving the best for first, i take it.
 jake, you'll be darryl mcmillionaire, smooth-talking wall street agent with a heart of cold. the only thing he cares about more than money... is cash.  and sophie, my beautiful little peach, you shall be playing moira cunt, a woman so hot, she doesn't have to be smart. and news flash: ...she ain't!
you're moira. from this moment on, i don't want you to break character until you die. you got that, "emily"?
who?
great.
okay, let me stop you right there. uh, for anybody who's a little bit too thickheaded to get what's going on, moira cunt, at this moment in the script, is trying to... mask her true identity.
okay guys, try not to lose your cum, uh, when you read what happens next. i know scripts don't usually get this salacious, but this is the hottest sex scene i've ever written.
okay, that's very hot. i might lose a little cum myself!
who am i to deny this on-screen chemistry?
ohh!
air jordan, fuckers!
i got winner.
y'all are a bunch of lisa leslies... and i'm rebecca lobo!
who else has anything to say about my personal appearance, or my persona? in fact... who here thinks i'm a persona non grata?
 looks like y'all need one more.
 take it out. i'll go jew on one.
let me bite her! let me bite her!
it's clear to me what's going on. i can take a hint. y'all don't want me here. right?
play me for it.
the court. play me for it. one take. one ball. one play. winner take all. you make it, you take it. playground rules.
 come at me.
ohhh!
boom, baby!
wooooo!
doesn't matter! i win!
playground rules!
nah. dq. i don't think so. flagrant.
go home, jake.
go home, jake.
nice!
i know.
sixteen?
sixteen.
yeah!
...yes.
okay.
good.
you said it first!
lord?
i wonder if i should get tinder!
mean!
loser! you have a tinder coach?
how many matches have you gotten?
long time.
oh.
oh!
why?
holy shit. how?
inhumane!
that's not a good reason!
where are you taking her?
...she's a bot.
...i mean, it's clear to me--
these photos are of--
all--
all these photos are of different strippers.
meaning, this one's blonde. this one's a redhead. this one's asian!
yeah, she wrote "hey, cutie. want to see me tonight? go to livecamgirlwhores.co.nz and enter your billing info."
you responded "i don't have a credit card. can i paypal or venmo you? i think this could be the real deal, and i'd hate to lose you over a technicality, lod."
she responds "sorry, cutie. no cash. need billing info."
you write "shit, shit, shit. okay, calling my dad. do not hang up, please."
she writes "don't worry, cutie. this is a text conversation. there is no hanging up."
alright...
yeah, you finally respond "my dad yelled at me, but i cried, cried, cried, and my mommy was able to make things right by snagging a pic of dad's cc."
"sending you some major coin as we squeak."
she says nothing!
you write again "i love you."
she said nothing.
you write "i love you so much, lod."
she says nothing.
okay, 'cause then you said "i'll see you tonight on the cam. i love you so much, lod."
she just wrote back "can't do tonight, cutie."
"i withdrew a thousand dollars from the account as a holding fee for next week."
yeah.
yes.
what?
"top five reasons--"
okay.
 yeah! oh my god, i'm dying! ...sharing that!
sharing that!
 i got helvetica! what font are you, you dingbat?
 here! here, i'm gonna post it to my news feed!
that way, you can click on the link and take the quiz yourself!
 i can't help it if they're viral!
...ouch.
 yeah!
 yeah!
 yeah!
actually working on a quiz of my own at the moment, if you're down to give it a shot.  would love some feedback. "what bean are you?"
good question! ...leema!
question the first...
"when you walk into a club, a techno, trip-hop, euro-synth style pub, are you a: down to clown like a kidney bean, all high and mighty."
"b: black bean style, muy caliente from head to toe. you're sexy and i know it."
"c: chickpea, or d: leema."
question the...  ...two...
 "which nineties fem teen trend would you most align yourself with, bean-wise?"
"a: kidney bean slap bracelets."
"b: black bean style locker photos of jonathan brandis."
 "c: chickpea-chee folders, or d: jared leto aka jordan catalano aka leema beans--" what song are you listening to that's more important than this quiz?
 it's gonna sound stupid, but they help me project a self-image i didn't even know that i had! ...in this increasingly anonymous world of modern technology, these "quizzes" give us the only thing that any of us truly wants, which is... an identity.  ...regardless of how... sophomoric it sounds on the surface, i truly believe that the hardest thing for any one person to know is themselves.
oh!  i got "soft-serve"! "what kind of doo-doo are you? shit-wise!"
 hey, you're watching jake and--
 let me do it!
 ohhh, yeah!  oh! did i tell you i'm doing a gluten-free june? nothing too drastic. just like a... gastric bypass, maybe a tummy-tuck, and a... a face lift.
chill with that shit.
ahhh, crap!
ahhh, double crap!
 yo yo yo, dj shmumu on the house! in the line, and turnin' it up! how's down, my playa?
sounds awesome! let me just check with my secretary!  hey, do we have work on wednesday the 25th?
can do! pencil this dj...! up? 
you'll never in a million years guess what i've been doing lately.
better. starting a dj business.
 good question! business is booming!
business is booming. i'm happy; you're happy for me!  i'm doing everything right now pro bono, but that doesn't mean i'm not makin' bank! 
i can't help it if my yelp reviews suck!
 wow.
yeah!
yeah!
yeah!
whoa, dude!
i just blacked out for a spell...
ohh!
 i'm gluten-free!
ouch much?  that hurt more than my last yelp review!
mickey, my friend!
yes, my friend. i too am excited and eager to be djing your daughter's wedding tonight!
yes, i already spoke to her regarding the playlist; it is set in stone. i assure you she is a lovely bride, and she's gonna get the reception she deserves. i'm actually... setting up the turntables as we speak, mickey!
not to give too much away, mickey, but i figure we start with the hora, move on to some playful, yet tasteful, golden oldies, before transitioning beautifully and seamlessly to the father-daughter dance! i believe the one you requested...  let me pull it up right now... is, uh... that's right! it's called "i'm not actually djing your daughter's wedding tonight, mickey!"
she's gonna be an ugly bride, mickey, and she's probably not gonna get married, mickey!
you know why, mickey? because my yelp reviews suck, mickey!
news flash, mickey: i press play on spotify... and i faint, mickey! yeah! i really faint, mickey! in fact, mickey... i'm fainting right now, mickey... mickey, help me out, mickey. 
mickey!
mickey.
we should start charging for this shit!
i know.
move. move. move.
 i'm sitting, i'm sitting, i'm sitting, i'm sitting, i'm sitting, i'm sitting! i'm sitting.
thank you. fatass.
hey, i wish i knew y'all were eating today. i would have packed a lunch, or bought one.
what's the point of conversation as it stands right now? i can wax poetic about a myriad of hot topics. 
okay... and what's the consensus? just so i can play devil's advocate.
and in terms of theses differences, are we excited or thrown by them?
 easy!
 been thinking about setting up a home theater system shit in my den!
what do you guys think is the difference between sonos and other leading brands like bose? or do y'all only like to talk about unimportant shit?
 really! because last time i checked, audio was the second-most important part of the audio-video experience.
i just wish we'd talk about my hobbies too, but i feel like i can't even get a word in edgewise.
not really a hobby, but i'm pretty good at alienating significant others. like if one of y'all's girlfriends or wives were here, i'd make her feel uninvited, unwelcome... i'd phase her out of the conversation, slowly but surely.  box her out physically, just so she doesn't feel like one of us.
at least we're talking about something!
can't handle the heat, huh? f-f-f-f-fatass?  ...i think i might be dying.
you don't have to tell me twice.
i still do. even if it's just us three: me, you, and this thin little fatass.
 and then there were jew. what should us two little sister-friends gab about? 
can't hear you! listening to a spotify playlist aptly named "songs that pair well with a carrot-based lunch".
are you still in the room, fatass?
...fatass?
i actually have a good idea for a video.
very well, then.
best part of life?
games! jinx! 
the next tiny wings is on this list. the next snood is on this list.
copyright infringement.
 doo-doot doo doot-doot doo! doo! jojo the italian plumberman.
let me see your phone.
okay.
what would you say if i told you i had a game that would fix this?
not yet.
ninety-five percent of gaming happens when you're on the shitter. so this game is called "wipe me", and you get to clean your butt virtually.
like, nobody thought to land on the moon, and then one night, we were just there!
i'm just saying let's do that, but with this fix-your-phone game!
shut up about your phone for a second. i'm... i'm having an idea.
you know how it's illegal to spy on people while they shit, shower, and shave?
 really?
no chance in hell. that's an invasion of my privacy.
no i won't. again. or for the first time. i won't, and i didn't. and i haven't. again. or ever.
i'm peeing. for a second.
oh! not really a game idea, but--
--i shave a soul patch.
and the truth finally starts pouring out!
 hmm-mmm, hmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm, yeah...
okay, so it's spotify, but only for songs.
really? because last time i checked, you play music.
i'll put it in the "maybe" pile, then.
 hmm-mmm, alright, hmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm, do it too...
let me tell ya, i had a lot of time to come up with game ideas as a teen. i had facial backne.
nope, fbackne. i'm talkin' about back zits on my face. i wish i would've had acne. acne would have been an improvement... acne would have been nice.
 two hearts beating as one, hmm-mmm...
parcheesi.
 yeah yeah, he just, uh, he just whacked it with a hammer, and it broke.  i know! i guess he-- i guess he thought he can fix it with an app, which i don't think you can do. could you? if you w-- even if you dreamed big? 'cause of the moon landings. okay. yeah yeah.  you're a moron.
"oops! all long pieces tetris".
well i don't have the ability or the rights to program it! okay? so i'm kinda stuck there, aren't i. don't say "nice", if you know for a fact i'm dead to rights.
i like lists.  in fact, can i pitch you a list of list ideas that i have?
 no, no no, he'd be honored to be on your "idiots of tech support" blog. the name is jacob hurwitz, and as for the picture, i have a primo one of him taking a shit. or a shower. perhaps a shave.  hm?
bless you!
i know!
"top ten vacation ideas for the summer", by amir judy blume-enfeld.
"number ten--"
"are you feeling zen? if not, a staycation is what i recommend. or better yet, don't be a jerk. unwind by being a man... and goin' to work."
"number nine: stop whining about the time. go to work. can you?"
"please?"
it's just the first two!
"number eight: you're overweight! 'cuz you overate. whip your butt into shape with exercise classes. that's right: a boot camp retreat, for all y'all fatasses!"
"number seven: a sawa named devon! this tween idol deserves that title. shack up with 'now and then' co-star devon sawa in his hollywood hills bungalow! now that sounds like a place that's... fun to go!"
you're thinking of brad renfro.
"number six: check out brad renfro's dicks!"
"it's been too long since you've gone to see him. won't you visit his mausoleum?"
"number five: an owen named clive! he's got a palace in the english hills, and you can visit and stay for the thrills! clive owen would love to have ya."
"number four: lock your door! this staycation is for you and a playstation 2. lock yourself in your room all summer and close the blinds. that's the best way i know how to unwinds! and if it's a weekday... go to work!"
"number three: how 'bout some tea? it's a good liquid that's nice for your soul. have it in a cup, a mug, or a... bowl..." what?
shit. yeah, i think i musta got...  i-- i need to get my shit together! 
"number two: this jelly won't do... we need a jam or a paste of some sort; 'almond butter is nice' is my... usual retort..." i'm sorry.
i'm fucking unraveling here! wheels are coming off as i stumble across the finish line!
yeah, i had a perfect game going!
oh! okay, here we go. "number one: palm springs. a desert getaway with your best friend."
"well i know it might be a long snot..."
"...but i figure it's worth a shot!"
"the tickets are booked. the price is right; i looked. so what sayeth thee, my ffb? will you go away with me?"
do it harder, like one--
oh no!
what happened?
hey, you're watching a real  goal! --episode of jake and amir!
wait!
it's fun to watch tv at work! thanks for including me, guys!
can i change the channel? can i change the channel, or do we have to watch this soccer shit?
 hi, twat. yeah, can we get two large pizzas, one medium pie, and, let's say, seven small 'zas?
and chicken wings? yeah, i love those frickin' things.
whats?
ever notice how we call it "soccer", but in the rest of the world it's all like "futbol! futbol! futbol!"
then laugh! it's an observational humor!
still! a chuckle would have been decent. got this fatass to grin about it! 
 count it!
 my credit card number is, um, uh...  it's sixty-nine.
alright. 
aww.
ahhh, this sport is boring. nothing ever happens. it's just like, pass the ball. kick the ball. i don't--
and the universe gives me a slice of humble pie! my point still stands, though: hardly anything ever--
in what fucking world do you live in?
yeah, i'm serious. this is my food, shitbird.
i'm not talking to you.
as a joke! 'cause sixty-nine means to 
everybody in this sport has a weird name. who's that guy? garageio?
weird.
take that back!
why? i didn't do anything bad. all i said was that sixty-nining was, like, a 
why is it when people take up soccer it's considered cute and quirky, but when i get a hobby, no one says jack shit?
well, not really a hobby, but when my family and i dine at restaurants that give you beepers while you wait for a table, i'll always pretend like it's buzzing. make my dumbass mom or my goofy dad walk up to the waitress, time after time, in vain.  then at the end of the bit, i'll throw the beeper away so that my dad ends up owing cash for it.
no shit, dude.
all i'm saying is that real athletes don't wear cleats. they wear real shit, like baseball shoes.
...i'm starting to think my only friend in the room  is fatass over here.  what do you think, dummy?  "who are you calling a dummy, dummy?"
 fatass loves it.
all's i'm saying is for a sport to be exciting, there should be points, you know? none of this low-scoring, tie-game bullshit--
why does this keep happening to me?
gay much?
sorry, i thought pat said that.
why is it, on airplanes, they give you little tiny napkins with your drink? what are they, afraid i'm gonna spill?
whatever. my point still stands.
yes it does! i'm just saying i don't spill shit.
oh, sh--
sorry, am i being a dumbass american for preferring baseball to this "game"? i mean, baseball might be twice as slow and pretty boring, but at least shit happens--
fuck, dude! this is more than a coincidence! this is so bizarre! i'm, like, freaking out! every time i bring up the low-scoring nature of the game, which it--
how?
that was fun, actually! when's the next match?
so what now? should we watch the mls?
what?
hey, you're watching jake and a celeb.
realistical!
yeah.
oh! i came up with a pretty neat little plan today... dating a celebrity?
life's not about what you know, it's about who you know. and in los angeles, it's about who ya fuck.  i'm serious. if i'm gonna make it in this kooky town, i have to be seen canoodling with jamie lee curtis on the sunset strip yesterday.
you naive little twat.
nothing's real in hollyweird, okay? a lot of it is just make-believe fairy dust. some of it is actually just a pr nightmare bullshit!
fuck off.
i changed the khakis! fuck off!
yeah!
uh-oh! daddy got amanda bynes's gmail address. yeah, her niece went to my cousin leron's laser tag place in queens. leron stole the cell phone, texted amanda, and she gave him the email address so he would give the cell phone back! i was gonna take you on a double date. me, you, amanda, and amanda's best friend, who's probably a meg ryan type, but i can always ask somebody else.
she's a loose cannon, sure, but sometimes the crazy ones are the ones that land you on the back jacket of star magazine!
no!
nice!
is that too forward?
is that good to write?
no!
 no!
promise?
even if one of the brothers ryan give her away doesn't mean i can't be your best man.
oh!
oh!
i'm nude! you've nuded me!
if the fates allow!
okay.
i should not have taught my mom how to text. look at this message!
yeah, that's mine to her.
dumb bitch! 
hey. that's my mother you're talking about.
oh! do you know these horoscope things everyone's talking about lately?
about how, like, if you were born in january, that means you're a capricorn, and so you're some type of way?
yeah.
i don't know, i-- it was in the ether, but now it's starting to get to me.
honestly, i thought a lot of it was legalese japanese mumbo-jumbo bullshit; western medicine meets western union; urban garbage yoga yuppie mommy-blogger rag-mag e-zine candyland cookie-cutter sci-fi wi-fi jai alai verbal diarrhea, but honestly, it turns out a lot of it is spiritual fact.
when's your birthday? august 5th, 1985?
2:15 pm?
okay. cool, so, like, yours is, uh--
 "you will confront conflicts this month, but rest assured you can solve them. maybe not, though." ...it's vintage you!
 no! because the way it works is that you're a leo, so the stars look like a lion, and it knows what you're gonna-- how you're gonna act.
yeah. they really do. they look like a lion.
no way.
my mind is not impressionable!
i guess it is.
 i will believe anything anyone says...
i'm getting...  sleepy...
very sleepy, master.
didn't have to.
i am your mental slave.
and thus, you are my master.
fine, master.
yes, master.
cluck like a chicken. something silly. boy, will my face be red.
jesus.
my fear is that the window will be closed and i'll break my neck on the glass. then you'll be left to deal with me as a quadriplegic, master.
mm-hmm.
no chicken.
...got it.
mm-hmm.
mm. a suicide note of sorts. yup.
absolving you of guilt.
got it.
chicken.
no chicken.
sure.
absolutely. thank you, master.
 aaah. jesus.  what happened?
 ...i'm texting you....
...hmm.
 that's right! my horoscope told me to be on the lookout for hypno-killers, and it was right! sagittarius, motherfucker!
 you still tried to kill me! little fucker!
you're watching jake and amir.
chill!
gum?
i'm gonna...have a slice ...thought i'd offer you one.
first you're ok now you're good?  what's wrong with you? you're acting all goofy-- i mean are you high at work? i'm not gonna tell anyone, i'm just down to toke! or at least have a bite of whatever edible you're high!
my gum.
i know. 
i come in peace. 
 hmm?
are you sure? it's on the house!
the pack was like two bucks! if you wanna toss me a dollar...sure that'd be fine . that'd be fair--
you said you were ok!? you said you were good-- you didn't say jack shit about no. holy shit; you are high!!
 slice. 
 oh. well. what are you gonna do for me? 
wait! i have something that you want ! you gotta pay me back somehow, that's how society works!  i'm not working here for free! 
 it's cool. it's friendly. it's chill--
it's like ...it's just a nice thing to do! 
shut up!  really!?  that language?!  from someone who has something that you want. it's tit for tat, jakey! when that tit-tat is a tic tac or a kit-kat, you can't go this that, hit hat! you gotta go mit ma--
 what?
jake--
gum's gone, man...alright? this is...
 it's such a--this is such a small thing in the grand scheme of things. i-i-it's infinitesimal! 
once.
really?...shit. i'm sorry!
just  look under your desk. 
now in terms of paying me back are you thinking about cash or favours?
well i still wanna hang out!!
hey, you're watching a very special birthday episode of jake and amir!
go! go! go! go shorty! it's your birfday! we gonna party like it0 your birfday!
 ...what?
 you said it so soft! it was a big deal.
i made a big deal of your birthday, and you're just like "thank you. thank you."
i'm-- i'm hyped!
i'm hyphy!
want to know the difference between me and 50 cents?
i do give a fuck if that's your birfday... i really do.
silly me, i guess. you know, the big two-nine, it's kind of a big deal. in fact, how would you like a two-nine fish sandwich?
 of course... why would you? let me do you one better. you know how you have a weird love affair with coupons?
 here's a book of three hundred and sixty-five coupons. one for every day until you reach the wipe old age...  of dirty!
 they get better.
they get better.
 they get better.
a hundred and fifty dollars. the going rate.
free of style! ...free of style! i'm starting to think you don't like the coupon book!
i can't take it back! it's non-transferrable! non-returnable! read the fine print! i couldn't take--
oh!
 no, no, like it really cut me! ya cut me bad!
fragile? ya-y-y-y-ya sliced me! ya really diced me, dude! and on my favorite day of the year: your birfday!
i'm leaking, murphy!
 murph! murph! it's your turf! come down to erf! you crazy smurf!
no, that was females only!
hey, you're watching jake and amir, and i'm gonna be rich!
money, honey!
okay...
good news! gonna finally heed your advice.
 i'm going to apply for a credit card.
one step at a time.
oh, backw--...
first thing's first: i'm the realest. 
don't have one.
 'cause i'm so fancy!  also i'm an illegal alien.
yeah.
can't wait to rack up these points!
miles.
trips.
...points.
miles.
...miles? ...miles!
oh, actually, i spent a hundred and ten thousand euro on a koi fish once.
well technically a dolphin, but it was a coy little fish.  little bugger was playing hard to get. we actually met each other-- have you ever been to the maldives, or mall-dives, or whatever?
my credit score is so low, someone once stole my identity, felt bad, and gave it back.
it's a truth! ...ruth!
i'm actually down to open a joint checking account with you. you know i do have tens of millions of dollars.
but, here's the trick: you do have to tell people about it.
...seventy.
aah, no no no, nineteen.
aah-- two!
i'm serious, dude. my credit score is so low, i couldn't get approved for a birthday card. 
phyllis diller is here...
so what you're saying is once i have this magic card, i can buy whatever i want, like a vehicle, or a three-bean salad, or a mr. skin pro account?
i know, but i can get, like, a salami sandwich, some silly putty, and, let's say, i don't know, a mr. skin pro account?
can i get a mr. skin pro account with--
my credit score is so low, flo rida wrote a song about it.
"whistle"! 
what i'm in dire need of is actually dolphin food. or dolphin medicine. or...
caskets, yeah. exactly right.
because you can stuff it into a human casket?
no, you can't.
call me han! because my credit score is...
...out of this world!
you know, human caskets, not too terrible of an idea.
if you just wiggle that dorsal fin back and forth like you're peeling off a soda tab, you know,  a, b, c... and then whatever letter it lands on, that girl has a crush on you?
 like if it gets ripped off on s, you're gonna marry a samantha...!
now i understand to build my credit score, i need to make my payments in a timely fashion.
okay, and if i don't will they hack my nuts off?
then i'm good.
then i'm good.
but my nuts? are they gonna take away my most prized possession? my family jewels? ...i'm okay then.
mirror, mirror, on the wa--  "denied". how is that normal?
 i wanted the points! i wanted the points, i needed the miles, and i could have really used a trip.  least i got my nuts.
...dude!
hey, you're watching jake and amir, and i do declare!
i don't know!
 unhealthy...  ...what?
unhealthy much!
 look at you--
 bad for your back, bad for your spine, bad for your life, bad for your attitude, bad--
 yeah, that's 'cause i have a standing desk! which means i can afford it...  ...fuckwad! 
 yeah, but on an exercise ball! okay? aka!
...what?
what are you, waiting for me to talk?  alright! let's talk!
okay, i didn't know that... wow!
i didn't know that! i thought it was like a pu-- yeah, like a...
it's a play on words!
my legs were tired, fatass! and by the way, this is healthy! healthier than the standing desk, 'cause i can do crunches while i work! 
yeah, well they hurt my back pain!
yeah! i have sciatica, motherfucker!
yes! which is why i can't stand. so i sit, which hurts my back. that's why i got the desk! it just hurts, so i'm sitting, aka!
...jesus!
that's, like, a lot of times you ask me to die.
 it's so... sad.
it's sad to me that you want me dead.
yeah. you're not even hiding it anymore.
i need to... i need to lay down.
 it doesn't matter if i'm sitting or lying, okay? as long as my work gets handed in.
i'm alive!
 and it's all thanks to that standing desk.
what?
not for long!
'cause the videos are short.
i can work from my phone.  ...shit.
 they're here, they're here! help me choose a headshot!
i just want your opinion!
about the headshots, idiot!  you should have let me finish! now you look like a fool!
i want to be a famous! ass! a star is born? nah... a star is corn!
please don't call these dumb. okay? i spent, like, a bad amount of money on these.
i have an audition today!
wow! suddenly, jake's-- actually, this is perfect!  i'll give you a fork and a knife so you can eat your words. and, in addition to those--
--i have a napkin... where the french is it? i don't want you to spill the words--
where the fff-- is it, dude?
the role is of a paralegal, in the film "steinberg and ginsberg".
every interview in this town is an audition. in this town.
 no, they're just blurry.
i think so, yeah. they're mosaic.
actually, they were taken by a brazilian photographer.  nunya? ever heard of him?
no, nunya luiz ricardio. he's actually pretty famous in rio.
been painting recently! nothing too crazy, just some abstract pieces. trying to open up my own gallery.
subjective.
 been baking recently!
yeah, nothing too crazy. just, uh, applying for grants to open up my own patisserie/gallery.
 found your napkin!
nothing too crazy, just some, uh... oregano.
roach!
ass!
nice.
i know.
 i did it a few weeks ago!
you invited me in here 'cause you said nobody else would hold your bucket for you.
aren't most people doing it with a...with a bucket and--
it-- it's called the ice bucket challenge--
"prboblem"?
no, i did not.
...maybe, yeah. i--
s-- ...so yes. just one.
alright. here we go. ready.
i don't know if it's that-- like, that--
three, two one!
whoa. the water wasn't that cold.
 to actually help out, go to alsa.org!
 your penis was really small.
hey, you're watching a very expensive episode of jake and amir!
cash!
hey jake, what do you call a twitter account for cottage cheese?
cheese!
hope you like to barbecue!
'cause homeboy's got a grill!
i like flaunting that i make cash!
 money--
my dad gives me bank. quite bank, actually.
i got this grill off sale!
no, my cousin leron. he has a friend named sale.
well, had a friend named sal.
sale. sale.
sale!
sam!
...sale.
off her. and no, not her grill, her teeth. okay? when she passed, me and leron had the dim idea  to gank the dentures off her still-breathing body!
we're all at the vet trying to huff some of that laughy gassy, when we realized: uh-oh! some of it's euthanasia! so me and leron hightail it the fuck out of there, but, uh... sale wasn't too lucky. she couldn't flap her wings fast enough.
did i mention sale was a goose?
i guess you can say she's trans-gandered!
 sure, small price to pay.
were!
no, i mean me and leron aren't cousins anymore! he frickin' divorced me!
how was your weekend? ...always talkin' about my shit. how was your friday? what'd you do saturday morning?
i traded them to leron for a bedazzler so that i can jewel-encrust sale's dentures so that i can flaunt my father's wealth! what don't you get?
excuse?
want to know the gayest part?
i truly believe that the world revolves around me.  not even metaphorically, either. like, uh, say this marble is me, and this tennis ball is our solar system? 
yeah, this is how i feel. like i am at the center of it. like i'm the sun.  i mean, how dumb is that?
yeah? well at least i got a grill i can count on!  hope you like sausage!
i'm the sun! i told you i was one!
hey, you're watching jake and amir, and if y'all want to follow me on instagram--
damn it!
how would you like to accompany me on an online shopping spree?
i paid for it with my privacy. you know apple owns your shit, right?
i think i'll order a v-neck and a plaid, 'cause i'm from teaneck, and hi, i'm brad! 
call me brad!
yeah, well airplanes were a bad idea too, but business is booming, so i'll take my chaunces.
oh, i should buy sunglasses.
no, i don't think so.
oh!
exqueef me. 
queef.  two distinct queefs.
you know, i just wish i had an event to wear these to. i mean, i'm buying these platinum-white dress shoes, but i literally will never wear them.
well, what if i get invited to a gala, ass?
 you know, whenever i go online shopping, i like to reward myself with a little "you're worth it" gift.  and today i got myself this zebra-print pillow!  i'm obsessed!
i'm sorry.
i was upset.
you offended me!
if it makes you feel any better, i might even get a plus one to the gala!
say that again, and i will scratch your other face!
hey, pretty neat little lifehack: if you put in a pseudonym in the shipping information, like vance or something, the package will show up with that fake name on it.
yeah, but then after a while, the mailman will start to call you vance! he'll be like, "hey vance, how's it going?" you'll be like, "oh, it's pretty good, but actually boom! gotcha! my name's brad!"
these white shoes are breaking the bank, but i feel like i gotta have 'em. you know, just in case-- and don't say what you're about to, or i will scratch you yet again-- but i feel like i gotta have 'em just in case i get invited to a charity event, or worse still, a, a--
a gala. yeah, exactly right, a gala.
no way.
no, dude! that's--
it's way too risky!
bought 'em.  i bought 'em!
we're going to a gala.
 you think this button-down is pee-proof, or dry clean only?
or dry clean only!
yeah, pee-proof! just in case i--
wha-- oh! oh, sh--
alright, i can't bear to look.  what's the damage?
huh. that was a cheap spree, to be sure.
well, you should have gone pee-proof! you know, just in ca--
oh my god, why again?
not me! my eyes are closed.
ow!
 check it out.
ohh!
oh, it's in me!
oh, shards!
shards where i shart!
 no! no, it's funny!
it's a funny goof!
it's gonna be worth it! when it starts copying my ass!
it's burning my anus!
no!
you'll ruin the joke!
yeah, it's burned. it's burned bad.
absolutely! sliced from taint to sphincter! gutted like a fish!
...is it funny?
the copies. am i the office clown as of yet, do you think?
where's the paper?
then have him scan and email it back!
 chicks can't do math, dude.
it's a five-in-one workstation! and fine, i'll-- i'll copy it. here we go. ready?
what the butt is that? "pc load letter"?
will you insert paper to tray 2?
will you insert paper to tray 2?
fine. i'll do it without you.
this-- this may kill me, sure, but, like with any tortured artist, my work will live beyond me.
i shall be remembered as a martyr, a cool, and a philosopher. for i have the anus of a god.
perfect.
worth it, baby!
yes.
i'm actually a little butthurt today!
ow...
 here comes the dweeb... here comes the dweeb!  shittiest weekend of the ever award goes to, dumroll please... amir hurwitz! "you like me! you really like me!" friday night, i crash a feminist meeting, and told each and every one of them the god's honest truth: that they were all on the rag! their aunt flo didn't just come into town to visit. she moved in, and they were becoming scissor sisters. i wish one thing led to another, because what happened next was all at once. they tied my wrists to my face, shoved a tampon in my asshole, and kicked me out into the street! keep in mind, this was 7:45 pm, so it's still bright out and i'm missing jeopardy! i will take "things you don't want your parents to see after leaving a restaurant for their forty-second anniversary" for, let's say, two hundred, alex.  doo doo doo doo-doo doo doo doooo... doo doo doo doo doo, ba-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo doo doo doo-doo doo doo doooo... doo, doo-doo doo doo--  --doo--  --doo. bom, bom. what is their thirty-one-year-old son scooting across the sidewalk like a baby in a diaper, trying to grind the tampon out of his bleeding asshole while he howls at the moon like a wolf! ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding! and what did you wager, alex? zero dollars? that's... that's funny, 'cause that's how much my life was worth to the police officer who, rather than unbind me, took out his motorola krzr and added me to his snapstory. what? just as i start to think outside the bun, you know, convincing myself that at the very least this will be a fun little anecdote to tell at my bachelor party-- if i don't decide to go stag to my own wedding-- four of these femmes fatales emerge from the shadows,  and start assaulting my face,  my body,  and my neck. all of them had hair of gold,  like their mother... the youngest one threw squirrels! one landed in my mouth, like a furry ball gag. finally, out of fear, loathing, or las vegas, i j--  i just start spray-shitting everywhere. yeah, it's like someone's dumping bucket after bucket of chocolate pudding on a rotating helicopter blade. i am defecating hither and thither, still howling, still at the moon, this time blue corn. with the tampon finally out, hands still tied to my face,  i finally have the wherewithalrighty then! to let out on more zinger. one more joke, this one luckily not at their expense. it's-- it's pretty broad, actually.  it goes a little something like this: a woman boards a bus with her newborn baby, and the bus driver says, "hey, ma'am, that's the ugliest baby i've ever seen." the woman, appalled-- frankly, she has the right to be-- sits down next to me and says, "that bus driver just insulted me." i said, "lady, you don't have to take that from him. you go up there and tell him off. here, i'll hold your monkey."
seeing you chuckle at that joke made the entire weekend worthwhile.
yeah? well my asshole needs stitches! so start laughin', buster!
hi, you and the nsa are watching jake and amir!
hi, obama!
hmm! congrats, grad!
you're getting the new iphone! amazing!
 by the way, there's no such thing as a "free upgrade".
 because you're paying for your shit--
 --with your privacy!
you know steve jobs spies on you, right? that every little camera on that phone is a peephole for jobs to peep your peep while you sleep?
good.
you know the iphone 6 actually has a bigger screen.  all the better to spee you with, my dear!
spee and sy!
spee and spy!
see and sy!
spee and sy-- see and spy!
as in, be inspired... fuckward!
let me shatter your perfect world for a second. every time you had phone sex on that phone of yours, it was actually an orgy. a group orgy. yeah, there's not just corporate spies on the line, man! there's legit frickin' government agendas reading your sex and getting off to every adjective! "what are you wearing?" i'll tell you what it is! it's the new apple icloak!  but it's not invisibility, it's actually visibility! aka, the visible ability... for apple geniuses... to get off! jerk off! nut to you! 
smile!  you're on dipshit camera! i just got a picture of the biggest dumbass i know.
fuck off. what's that supposed to mean, "was it a selfie"?
 when we designed the new iphone, we had one facet that had to be absolutely necessary, and that was the fact that we wanted to jerk off!
so we put a camera here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, everywhere! 
mine's jailbroken, you fucking idiot! it's running linux, java!
mm-hmm! mm-hmm! you know why? so that i don't lose it, dipshit!
good. 'cause every front-facing camera, of which there are probably a baker's dozen--
--is a glory hole for jobs, woz, and spielberg to fuck you with.
i didn't say it.
i'm serious.
you don't get it! you got your imac, your icloud, your ipad, your ipod... it's all i i i! ay-ay-ay! it should be you!  it should be you, you, you!
ouch.
 it's here, it's here!
 yeah, but i'm gonna hack it!
