como una promesa, eres tu! eres tu!
it hurt more yesterday, yes. my entire face was in a blister.
yes, just a small, small leetle bit of an accent.
i was lost for many moons, and many suns.
yes, 17 moons, and oddly 21 suns.
well maybe i missed some moons, yeah.
yeah, cause i fall asleep at nighttime.
do you want your souvenir or not, i had to smuggle it.
let me just pass it through me, sanitize it, and give it back to you.

hey, thanks asian for the invite last night! 
i just really needed to get out of the house, so i appreciate it.
 ...is this like an inside joke based on something that happened, because i'm sorry, i was a little bit gone.
yeah, i say a lot of funny things. 
i thought the party needed a new energy, okay?!  sometimes nights are about what kind of energy you're able to infuse -
 i had just drained the main vein...like 25 seconds earlier.
a lot of the girls last night were slumpbusters, can we talk about that for a second?
that reminds me; that slumpbusting sasquatch owes me a five-spot. an abe lincolner.
 you probably think, you think you're cooler than me.
 ...no...
 i had just drained - 
 ...vaguely?
 i'm sorry, is there a point to this story?
 why don't you ask me why i'm mad, okay?! you take me to a slumpbuster festival, i haven't gotten any in like weeks - i'm on a 2-month dry spell - and everybody is outta my league.
they're both, okay. i'm a 1, and they're 3s!!
 no, you stop and listen to pee.
 i just drained the main vein like a day ago. on a cake, lest you forget.
 guys! guys! stop it, stop it!
i'mi'm not a ghost?  oh! 
 i'm lerona's twin sister.
i'm jessica.
okay, well
what, uh 
no
 anyway!
what?
yeah, well, so are you two!  i mean, youyou act like a four-year-old in a twenty-eight-year-old's body.
 and youjake, you stole your best friend's girlfriend, and then you killed her.
oh, and by the way, fedoras are not stylin'.
because i'm not lerona's twin, okay? i am a ghost. i came back here to see what nice things you guys would be saying about me, and instead, you're flirting with my fake sibling and talking shit about me.
 you know what? whatevers. bye. 
 we're not transparent, you know! it really hurt. 
 it did. 
 it did. 
woah, pervert alert!

well, i kinda get the sense that you make those jokes a lot...
well maybe he was just fed up, and... didn't want to be here anymore.
