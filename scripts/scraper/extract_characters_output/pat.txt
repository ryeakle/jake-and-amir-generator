jake, amir blumenfeld died the day before you were hired.  there's nobody there! 
 yeah, sorry; just dropped my pen. ah, you're nuts though. get your shit together. i'm going home. 
sarah is a big girl, she's going to forgive you, dude. the important thing for you, right now, is to just get her out of your mind.
you're not helping.
 yeah, you are. 
so did i, you're digging your fingernails into jake's arm. 
this  is what you need, ok? look, it's your favorite beer, the one with the--
jake, i'm telling you. sarah is not the only girl out there, ok? there's a million pebbles on the beach.

no, that's not what i meant. 
i can't read that. 
no. you just don't know how to spell. 
i'm going to tell you w-what my dad told me, and it's got me through some of the hardest times--
 thank you!

hey, sarah, umm, it-it's pat. umm, again. ha. listen. uh, last night was just, it was   incredible. i know that you just think of it as a one night thing, but i, you know what? i think we should do it, you know, do it . . . i want to date you. i think we should date.  stead-go out steadily, we should be- go steady with one another. also, oh, i want to apologize because for, when, the way jake reacted, and the way he hit me that night and scared you.  umm, i didn't- i seemed like you were terrified, that's probably why you were laughing. i'm sorry, i'm rambling, i'm rambling, i'm so, i'm just- i never felt this way before! anyway, umm, oh.  ok, sarah, i got to go, amir is calling me. ok, bye. 
nah, shut up!
no, man, you made me forget what i was talking about, amir. ok? oh right, so han has to go save le-
uh-oh. someone didn't smoke enough. 
ugh, you're such a wiener, dude. anyway, han calls chewbacca 'chewy' because they're friends.

ah, there he is.
welcome back, man!
yeah, you make it happen my dude?


well, it's good to have you back, jake.
ahaha, you almost had me, man.
you're back.
 oh lord!
hey jake, uh, can you print out those files for the three o'clock meeting please?
great. thank you.
oh, jake! hey, um.. could you help me write, um, this email, to this girl?
okay. no, you know, could you do it now, cause i just want to get it out while the moment strikes me.  
 so what i have so far is hello but i thought maybe in this case i should do something more casual cause this is a love letter..
hey
i'm watching you, so don't steal anything from me. okay, strong. it's agressive. i like it. 
what else?
i'm going to break your neck. alright. you know what? 
good.
your soft and chewy 
you've got beautiful eyes. yeah...
they're blue but there's a tint or brown in there, i guess.
your eyes are like blue chocolate chips.
can you just do me a huge favor and leave me alone forever
i am playing hard to get... she's going to come crawling back to me!
 what are you doing? i call you over here to come help write a letter and you eat your damn dessert-
thank you.
okay, message sent... the fuck happened to you?
i didn't know that.
 will you just let me work, please? you are insufferable!  wow, this is actually really self aware, amir.  i'm kind of proud of you. 
 hey, that seems pretty fishy to me, pat.  hey cortan that's not a fisher-  
where the hell is my computer?
i heard that.
and then don carleone says, 'i'll --
make him an offer he can't refuse'! 
oh my god. 
i love the godfather.  
have you seen it?
um, can i ask you a question?
what do you think of jake and amir?
well, you know, it seems like they hate each other, but i think recently, it's like, they're like legit best friends. 
yeah but, i mean, there's definitely an underlying respect they have for each other.  i sense it. 
yes! and then remember christmas? they went home together.
what? 
what? 
come on. 
lover's quarrels?
yeah, i mean, jake punched me when we slept together,  remember?
i'm sorry.
that was way out of line.
no, yeah. but i thought that that meant we wouldn't talk like outside the office or something. 
or if it came up organically. 
hey.
ok, that was--
my kyndle! 
yeah i can call the karaoke place, but someone else has to dial for me because amir broke my fingers
so, if the room is 300 dollars for the night
man, it's crazy out there.
hey, where's amir?
woah, woah! what are you guys doing with my dad's antique dresser?
hey guys, um, sorry to interrupt. has anyone seen a bag of cookies? by any chance?
no? are you sure?
oh, totally separate incident: i'm missing eighty cents.
 yeah, one sec! 
dude, is that shit?
soda pop: the final frontier. these are the beverages
 oh my god, amir?!
what's the joke?
oh, uh, yeah actually, i did.

i-
daphne.
no, you know what? i would rather-- we should just break up.
i do, yeah. sorry, go away. 
hey, jake, why are you giving amir such a hard time, man? i head you say you wanted the ipad yourself, what's up?
why?
oh, view what?

you saw him too!
come on. 
for the gift.  how much do we owe you?
you never said that.
you never said that!
no. 
is that a sincere apology? 
i was not even on board for the headphones. 
so it's not all inclusive! 
so you cry when you don't get the gift that you want?
oh! ohhhhh!
it's just pudding!
what does that mean?
we heard you got your ears pierced, so we came over to make fun of you.
we don't.
you kissed your cousin at a club?--
what's going on here?
did you specify no hip touching?
you lost man! get over it 
you already lost, get over it!
you monster!
woah, woah, twinsies! did you guys plan that, or...?
woah, woah!
aghh!

 oh my god, that is ripe! 
you!  are you fucking insane? you threw a match at me while i was taking a dump!
 woah, woah, hey hey! look guys, guys: tank top triplets!

oh my god... amir! amir, oh my god-- jake! get off of him!  amir! wake up, man. breathe, buddy! breathe!
jake, don't die on me, man!
jake, stay with me, buddy!
shut the fuck up!

oh! um... actually, it's-- it's a pretty sad story. um, as you know, my dad... is not feeling well; he's sick, he's very sick--

jake, sorry... didn't you buy, like, ten bitcoin a few months ago, when they were selling for twelve hundred a coin?
why?
how is it the future of everything?
meaning...
and how is cash traceable?
how are dollars traceable?
jesus!
i'm not jewish.
this is absurd.
this is so weird.
hey, amir, you know, for what it's worth, i'm proud of you for standing up to that, uh... really weird bullying.
what does that mean?
...i'm dead...
he has a point, jake.
yeah. go home, jake.
no no, it's fun. it's just... new york is so dense and lively, you know? and-- and, and la is more spread out and chill.
no consensus, really. we;re just saying they're different.
...right. so... you know, new york just has a way of getting under your skin--
are... are you serious?

see you in four years, everyone.
