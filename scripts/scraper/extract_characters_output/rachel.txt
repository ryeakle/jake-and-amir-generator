 hello.
 i'm sorry, i missed the train. i must look terrible.
goodbye! 
i'm mad at you because you saw me speaking hebrew at a bar and hit on me, demanding that i come meet you here at this park, that you'd have a translator. i told you i spoke english well, and you laughed, saying that it was a cute attempt at speaking normal.
i figured i'd come here for a free meal, but you are so unbearable to be around, that it's not worth it! though i am happy that you're not wearing that ugly fedora anymore. and those dog tags.
is that a watch?
ugh. 
and we already have pizza.
 make him stop!
i think soccer players are the hottest.
