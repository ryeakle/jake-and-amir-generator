you're watching jake and amir.
nice.
it's okay, but-- hey, jake, uh, if your date had dietary restrictions, you really should have emailed us ahead of time. that would've been polite.
well, you just threw him a curveball that he can't hit, and i kind of need tonight to go perfectlyyyyyyyyyy...
hey, c'mon, c'mon. easy on the grig', easy on the grig'.
i know. it's jake's fault. it's jake's fault. he raw-dogged us, he did-- you're blinking a lot--
that's exactly what he did. he just took us and he just fuckin' took his dry-ass little dick and he just shoved it in our raw buttholes.
 alright. right; spit-- just spit on it. that's all i'm asking. just spit-- just one. right. that's fine.
it was his fault!

'sup, jake. ...making amir feel bad again?
 i think that you owe amir an apology.
 i don't think amir could hear you.
because you were yelling like a bitch.
so let's try that again, jake.  this time, without the bitchly screaming.
amir, do you accept that?
amir, should we give jake one more chance to apologize like a man...  and not scream like a bitch?
 everyone deserves a second...  chance!
 i'm applying warming jelly to your back. jake, the soup wasn't burning hot... it was freezing cold.  you went into shock, and... we told you your body was covered in third-degree burns.  it's funny, you know? you're always wondering what to expect... maybe you should start expecting what to wonder.
oh shit, i'm sorry.
what'd you say about me?
 that's good writing.
very good writing.
 sex scene! jake!
it's a little too hot, don't you think, jake?
 off-screen chemistry!
 that's it!
 jake. i saw what you did to amir there.
it's actually a huge deal.
and i've caught you...  bitch-handed! yeah!
i don't give a fuck if it's your birfday! it's your murphday now.
too bad. it's your murphday.
it's your murphday. you shouldn't hate it. eat your murphday cake.
