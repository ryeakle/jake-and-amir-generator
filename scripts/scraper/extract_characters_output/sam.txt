wow, you're just saying that because you have a crush on her. 
so why did you specifically ask to be her secret santa this year?  really? 
and why did you spend all day sunday finding her a first edition copy of her favorite childhood book: where ze wild ziings aren't? 
is it? 
hey, jake, don't talk to me for the rest of the week.  make that ever! you can give that gay-ass book to somebody else! 
 hey! hey! hey! through me. 
wow, that was epic! 
oh man, oh man! amir, get the hell out of here! 
 amir gave me like, promised three thousand dollars.
i'm already in his computer.
jake is sick today so he wanted me to email him some stuff at home.
it's trash and this chat is with you.
he called you impossibly dumb and extremely lonely.
searching dirt isn't going to get us- it's jake talking dirty to his girlfriend. i can't believe that worked.
that's nowhere in this chat.
we shouldn't be using jakes computer in the first place. i feel ba- he left his facebook open too?!
you already said that.
smooth.

i don't know what a cardigan is either...
i was making an educated guess.

you know what we should do? we should go to the movies and see if they're good enough for you and jake.
my parents are not how you say, alive.
 they died in a plane crash.
