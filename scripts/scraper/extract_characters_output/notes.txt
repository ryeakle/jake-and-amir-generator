evidently, i know next to nothing about poker so i may have missed out on some lingo. i also am not completely familiar with all the guys' voices so some names may not be right when someone's talking off-screen. there were a ton of inaudible things i just couldn't put together so if y'all could help, that would be awesome comploodle. be as nitpicky as possible. :p oh, and a huge congratulations to the cumulative and collaborative effort of this subreddit to have now officially transcribed every single jake and amir video ever. oh sheesh y'all.
