we present to you:
starring:
ok, of course, of course.
well done.
ooh, good question, he asked: "what the fuck did i just watch".
oh no.
blue.
let's go samuel!
i have a question if you don't mind.  you guys mind? don't care what you say. my question is: what were your motives? why did you choose to do this as a movie?
s'cuse me
s'cuse me i'm getting my seat.
i'm getting my seat-
i'm getting my seat.  maam, what's your name?
franklin, let me ask you this-
do you wanna get with a hero, a zero, or a gero. 
um...
this one is made of lamb  but the b is silent.
aah! the beginning one was, jake! blamb?  maybe you've heard of it?
just kidding,  it's a joke, it's a joke...
...it's a joke, it's a joke.
 good! good, good, good, good, good, good. un-believable.
do you mind if i ask you another follow up question?
fantastic, do you have any ideas for maybe, i don't know- a sequel?
tell me.
excuse me!
did your head hurt?
did your head hurt when you rose from hell and you hit your head on the ceiling, you- devil angel.
i don't know
are you trying to pick me up? it seems like you are! if it's not me then who? who do you love?
i am a priest! congratulations, you have been wedding-ed 
i now pronounce you: man and wife 
hey, you're watching adele dazeem and amir, on collegehabbaps.
oh, my name?
it's funny you ask, 'cause i have a very ordinary name, and you've never met me before, so i can understand why you'd ask, so do you want to hear it?
my name-- here it comes --my name is cherry dude! ...cherry... dude!
 ...it better!
 i think you'll find that the door is locked.
aaah. it's the door that i need to open!
well! i will be back with a key, and a donut! okay?
 here i come to save the day!  look what i brought.
i forgot the key!
i ruined a donut!  i'll be back-- with a donut!
with a key.
i'll be back with a key.
right.
and--
oh, just a key this time!
it confuses us.
this time i remembered...  the key!
 that's a donut. 
 if you want to view paradise...
now i know you haven't eaten in the past twenty-four hours, but feast your eyes on this!
then feast your mouth on this!
moving on!
now let me give you a little info on the place.  we're currently inside a five-bedroom, six-bathroom colonial townhouse, in williamsburg, virginia.
okay, that's my fault. it's the wrong listing.  aaah! here we are inside a blueberry muffin.
is that wrong too?
okay, let's back 'er up. aaah! 
we're currently inside a shithole in crack city, usa.
moving on! 
do you guys like bathrooms?
ohhhh, damn it.
this place has zero bathrooms.
what i do is i take a shot of moisturizer, and i get real wide, get over a toilet and go like this:  hakuna matata. haaaaaakuna matata! nothing happens. that's just to scare it, to get ready. cut to seventeen hours later: i'm in my bed, shittin' my balls off. moving on!
i shouldn't tell you this--
okay, fine! do you want to know who lived here before you guys?
have you heard of a little band called the rolling stones?
well, the serial killer who lived here loves the rolling stones. played it while he killed people!
lives here. moving on!
oh, i forgot to ask you! oh, no! do you guys have any pets?
ohh-ho-ho! good, 'cause this place already has way too many pets.
they're at work.
yeah. uh, you never seen a rat be a chef before?
yes! but a dog animated it.
just like the movie "willy wonka", the walls taste like things.
 this one tastes like asbestos!
 the snozzberries taste like snozzberries.
ten--
--thousand--
-dollars--
--a week.
well, i do have two other listings.
i do have one other listing, but it is absolutely terrible.
but there wouldn't be a part two if we didn't see it!
i do have one other listing, but it is absolutely terrible.
welcome to part two of juke and aboot!
i can't believe we're even in this place. look at it. it's a dump.  it comes with all the furniture... ugh, and do you smell that? you might want to clog your nose. it smells like fruit.
well, if you love the smell of this, i got a muffin on fairfax that'll drive ya wild!
can we leave, please?
another one of the countless things wrong with this place: the tv doesn't even work.  it's all in black and white, and it only plays soccer.
 whatever you call it in england, your majesty!
 ahhhhhh...
wipeout! ...please say we're done.
here's another guest bedroom, but what's the point of having a bed in a room?
and you're a bad boy! 
hmm.  i mean honestly, i can't even count--
no. i don't know how to count.
i don't know how to count. but, let's all get up! three, two, heel!
and here, we have your own personal movie theater, but what's the point of jerking off in a movie theater if strangers aren't like "hey! hey, this is frozen! stop doing that! cool dick, dude!"
moving on.
s-- you know what, i think you probably just took a shit on the masseuse.
yeah. did he talk?
different language?
was his name sven?
i can't believe he just let you shit on him... here we go. 
so, we have seen apartments today; do we know which way we are leaning?
 yeah. i think so.
no need to say it!
we know which one to get!
but just in case, should we say it?
don't need to.
'cause we got it.
