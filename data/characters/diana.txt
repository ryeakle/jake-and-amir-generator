He was joking.
No, thanks...but I'm free tomorrow night.
Well he can come, can't he? Why can't he come, Jake?
What do you mean?
Oh, these are really good pictures!
Jake, you look so cute in this one.
Jake, relax, it's just a joke.
Jake!
Hey.
OK.
Jake.
I need you to break up with Amir for me. ?
He's crazy! I can't do it myself.
Did you know that he only eats Chicken McNuggets?
No, I mean, only eats Chicken McNuggets. Nothing else! Not even water. ?
He came to my house this weekend. ?
In California. How did he even get there?!?
He's putting on that penguin suit right now, isn't he?
I-I can't, I'm sorry, you have to do this for me, Jake. Thanks. Lunch this weekend?  ?
