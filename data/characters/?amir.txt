I went camping.?
Huh??
I asked around, nobody really wanted to go, so . . .
The Adirondacks.?
Yeah, it's 350 miles north of here.
I took a cab.?
Seventeen hundred dollars.?
I don't. ?
No. I mean I thought I'd catch a fish or something.
No, that's the worst part. I had to like, follow squirrels and try to club them over the head with a fishing rod.?
My leg!
Oh, hmm, let's see Jake, uh...it couldn't possibly be plastic, so...?
Uh, it would be ridiculous to think that they take plastic and they melt it down to a thin layer. Oh that's in-that's insane, nobody could figure that out, who'd crack that mystery? H-how do they get the air in there? I don't know, do they...put it in?
Yeah, well, let's see, it resembles bamboo canes and that nodes are twen--
I'm looking at corn. How do you spell bubble wrap? ?
No shit.
I know! I took a Sex in the City thing and it tells you which character you are and I'm a Charlotte. That's the lesbian!?
Isn't it? Oh. The cute one.  That's pretty fly. Actually I'm going to forward you, forward to you the URL, brotha. ?
Take it. I bet you'll be a  Carrie.
The cuber the better.?
Uh, he'll call you, how about that? He'll fucking call you. So great. Problem solved! You can leave! ?
Pah. Pah. Pah. Buh-bye. B-bye, roll away faster next time, when someone does you a favor, right?
Well now he respects me.?
What?! What did she say to you? I'm not ready to be a dad!?
OK, let me finish. We look tired because  we were up all night.
All night long.
Jake. We were basically all night holding each other. I'm her cuddle buddy, it's stupid.
They should call me Mario, I jack so many coin-o's.
Hey! My princess Diana, you're more alive than she'll ever be.  Still made contact, you saw that. ?
Be nice!
...OWW!!?
What happened??
What happened?
What about?
Why wouldn't she do it herself?
Nobody should ever outlive a relationship with somebody else, especially her.?
Can I be serious with you for a second? ?
I thought she was the one.
The one, whatever. The one...well I don't know, you just say it. You just say it and the girl smiles and kisses you on the cheek... OH GOD THIS SUCKS!
Well which McDonalds?
Ugh, god, a dry McNugget, huh?! A dry McNugget! As if my day wasn't going bad!?
It's fine. Ugh! Sweet and sour first! Sweet and sour first! ?
There's a difference.
You're going to die now! ?
Works every time!
Whoa, hold on a second, I'm going to put on the SyFy channel. I think there's a special on ghosts...like me!
Whoa, pizza!
How about, I already feel bad about it so don't make me feel worse.
FINE! Jeez louises, enjoy! All right? Have fun.
Did you check yet? It's fly as shit.
So... ?
OK, I guess I think I know when I'm not wanted.
