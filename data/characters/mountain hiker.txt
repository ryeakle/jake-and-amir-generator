I gotcha ya! Finally!
Ah, I'm so sorry. I thought you guys were cows.
Because of the way you were talking.
Who am I?
Thank you so much for asking that. You guys know Bear Grylls?
Yeah, well, I'm Stanley.
Who the fuck is Stanley Grylls? Who's this guy?
Who's this jack-a-lope you bring along?
I can help you guys outta here.
No no no. A baby could get out of that net.
I'm happy you asked that. I am hunting the most dangerous game of all.
Cows.
Think about it, man. Overweighted-ness, diabetes, heart failure, um...choking on stuff.
What the fuck is beef? Who is this guy?!
Well are you kidding?
Surely, he's kidding.
Thank grood-ness.
Uh, half the cars in the United States and Milwaukee are all driven by bovines.
Saw it in a documentary.  You should see it. It's called The Far Side by Gary Larson.
Uh, I think it's on Netflix In-staunt.
Uh, a cartoon based on facts.
A cartoon based on jokey facts.
Hold back, hold back, hold back.
Moo moo.
Oh! You're not a cow.
Ugh, the way you were using your cow-y fingers I was almost certain of it that time.
Cows has hooves!  You hear that, Tree? Cows has hooves.  Next thing you're going to tell me is that top hats don't have tops.
I can't draw a cow. There's not enough time.
Okay, stop. You could give me 2 months straight and all I have to do is draw a cow, and even then, I couldn't draw a fucking cow.
We can talk about cows until they come home, but the fact of the matter remains your friend is missing and we must find him
The hunt is on. Do you have your safari hat?
Good.  You're gonna need it.
