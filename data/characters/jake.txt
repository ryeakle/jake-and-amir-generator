Guy who is been secretly collecting playboy magazines for twenty-five years and tries to sell them all of them on ebay without his wife knowing.

A guy getting upset with his friend who's being complaisant about adding videos to edit on his computer regarding a serious video they're shooting.
Incoherent fast talking
More fast talking

Hey, Amir. What are you doing?
What's a beerd?
Yeah.
Oh...
Kind of like a spork is a spoon and a fork?
Now I get it.
You shouldn't do this.
The joke--the joke is in the spelling of beerd.
It's then--it's not gonna work.
Let's do quick characters.
Yeah, what?
Dude!
I feel like such shit, you trusted me and I let you down.
So pimp. It's just so fucking pimp. Soaring like a majestic eagle or something. Like, that's it, right up in the air, that's my
Nothing. Nothing.
Nothing.
No... I flew a kite, is what it was.
I flew a kite this weekend.
Well, I wish I was kidding. My sister wanted to or some shit like that. So... it's just like... homo. Of course I didn't like it,
No.
Just kidding, it was so fucking pimp.
What's going on?
Yeah.
Man. What time do we have that meeting? It's like, 4? Or 2?
I don't really...
Do you know, just like, when--
I'm really trying not to.
You don't- you don't have to.
What is it of?
That looks like a fish or something. Is that what you got?
A bear? Where is it? Where did you--?
When you get a tattoo, you get it of something and in a specific spot. So, it's of a bear, you said, and where is it?
What area?
Let me see it!
Is that a dick.. on your... stomach?--
Let me fucking see that!
It says GAY'!
Okay, you sunk my Milky Way.
Can we stop? I'm down like eight bucks.
Ok.
Fuck you, dude...
: I'm sorry, I really-- I didn't mean anything--
I didn't mean it like that...
...uh...
You know what, let's...  why don't we just talk about i--
Aah!  Fun... funny!...
Yeah...
Good one... What do you want me to say, it really fucking hurt!
You're drunk right now?
Ah... you... nice.
How many? How many is so many?
How many beers did you have?
Sixty? That's... Sixty is way too many. That's not a believable number at all.
Twelve?
Yeah, I don't believe you. I don't think you know... I don't think you've had a beer, ever.
So what does it taste like?
It's not sweet. Like sugar?
Closer. Like what?
No, no, it doesn...  It's not that either.
Exactly, so what does it taste like?
Ok...
You see where I'm at, but you weren't reading it?
I'm not drinking tonight, I have to take my cat to the vet, actually.
She's having, uh, she has heart palpitations and they might have to put her down.
What are you doing?
You know what I mean.
I put on sunglasses and then you put on, like, the exact same pair.
It's, like, the idea of putting on sunglasses.
You know what I mean. Just, I put on sunglasses and then you did.
Okay, well yesterday, when I wore these sunglasses, you called them gay. So. And you don't even own a pair of sunglasses.
No, now you're just admitting that you're a poser, because you got something because other people liked it.
Your phone didn't ring.
You have your office phone on vibrate?
It doesn't go right to dial tone when you lose somebody.
Hey Amir.
That's good. You win. Tie, or whatever. I just have to answer this email. One sec. I'm dead! Done. Alright. Stop for one second, I just gotta make a phone call. Mom? Hey, did you call me before?
I have to call you back.
Oh sorry. Yeah, what is it?
It's actually pretty tight.
That's actually really tight.
I mean, I dunno. I think, I mean all your friends know you on your screen name that you have
Well, I mean was it available?
I'm not surprised.
That's tough.
Sorry.
If I had a screen name that chill I definitely wouldn't trade it with anybody.
Really?
Honestly, if I thought of a screen name that chill I wouldn't have told anybody until I'd already made it.
I'm just trying to pimp out this chill pro right now. What's that Jovi quote?
What's Streeter's handle? I need to add him. I'm trying to flesh out this BL right now.
Chill out, dude. All's fair in love and chill, you know that.
Hell yeah we did!
What was that?
A girl wrote it. And a girl sings it. It's about a girl who got broken up with by a guy.
You don't go to the gym.
Come on!
: Alright, can I, do you think I can just call you back grandma?. Alright. Love you. Bye.
200?
What're you talking about?
Did you deduct 50 points?
For being dumb enough to take an online IQ test?
How many questions were there?
Alright, ask me one.
Yeah.
No, that's right.
There's only 7 questions there.
Sounds like a scam.
So you have to pay for that diploma, right?
Right, that sounds like that's the scam. You're paying for something that doesn't mean anything.
Ok, fine. Send me the link.
This is REALLY easy. You only got a 180?
What the hell?
You turned off my monitor?
I did figure it out and it was you, you turned off my monitor.
Can you just plug it in? I have to do, I have to do work.
I already plugged it back in. It's fine.  Just got a text message. From you. '180'.
Yeah, it was. It says... it says who texted you.
Yeah, sometimes, if you press the right buttons it says 'Restricted'.
Not maybe. It just does.
Ah, no thanks. I'm pretty tired.
No.
Well, yeah. I said no to both, so...
Fine. Sorry.
Honestly, don't worry about it. Forget it.
Take no for an answer. I don't want you to come tonight.
Listen, I just, I don't want to do anything tonight, but I'll answer your question; it's Stella. But don't come over.
Ok, you're not listening to me. I really don't feel like doing anything tonight. I'm sorry.
Uh, god. I'm just really tired, I want to get home, I feel like shit. If you absolutely have to come over, then...
Do you mean Red Bull?
But you also said dog.
Forget it.
That part's so funny. It's really funny. Go back, play it one more time. The look on your face is priceless. That part's so funny, just rewind it; just watch that one part again.
But your face in that one part is just priceless. I have a really good idea; if you just take a screencap of that one part, and then we'll take it into MS paint, and write something like 'Box of  Popcorn: $4.99, Movie from Blockbuster: $2.99, Amir's face at this part: Priceless.'
Right. When's the last time you saw a face look that priceless?
What about this one?
Give me a price on this face.
Ok, I have a really good idea for a new one, check it. Like take a whole, entire bag of pretzels, and you tear it open and you just put it on your face like .
Kites are gay.
Ask me one and I'll tell you the joke.
Because torn is gay.
Ok, are you going to deny that torn is gay?
Rewind this one.
What's the matter? Are you tired? I'll do this.
Ch-ch-poooh.
Just start the song.
Forget it.
Don't do the guitar, I'm doing the guitar.
I started it first, man. I'll do the drums.
Fine. Do that, but that's bass.
You're doing guitar again.
I just realized we're listening to 2 separate songs.
Well, yeah, it's weird more than anything.
What? What are you taking about?
What are you referring to?
That's not how those work. They all mean something.
No, that means something. That means not to like expect too much of anything.
That means like to work hard.
I couldn't. They all mean something.
Yeah.
Do you honestly think that's how proverbs work?
Forget it. I'm just gonna ignore you the rest of the day.
Alright. You're right. See? Makes sense.
Nevermind.
They're pretty ace.
Ace is just like when something it's cool.
Yeah.. It's ok.
Yeah.
What do you think of just like rock in general?
Yeah. I just made up the word ace, because you always steal my words and I wanted to see if you would
Ace isn't real. I just wanted to see if you would steal it.
Yeah.. I made up that one too.
Yeah...
No.
cinaducks, no.
No, that one is real.
No.
Yeah.
crunches on one No.
You just ate.
No. I'm starving. I didn't...I didn't even eat lunch.
No. It wouldn't be hard.
Here's a pen cap. throws the pen cap and it hits Amir in the face
Honestly it's not important.
Fine. God. hands Amir a cookie
This is why I don't give them to you, 'cause you do this every single time.
Did you say 'discussing'?
That was close.
Why did you even want one?
holds up the obviously store-bought bag of cookies You thought these were homemade?
Oh yeah, my mom puts the nutritional information on the back.
You know what? I was actually gonna call my mom right now.
puts the phone to his ear Hey mom. It's Jake.
Could you send me another pack of cookies? You know how I like it with um...the cream in the middle..and uh..wrapped in plastic with the nutritional information on the back? Great! All right, love you. Bye.

The next what? Do you want me to..?
Am I supposed to finish that sentence for you?
Yeah.
Uh, no that's stupid.
Okay so just skip this one then.
'Cause the Barry Bonds idea was no good.
Yeah, that one's not gonna work just because, uh, Facebook already kind of has you know, every--all the college students--
Okay.

Uh, yeah. Sounds like a standard idea. It's not bad.
Okay, so....
So you don't get how businesses work.
Okay so next.
Nope.
Nope. It's your list. Just cross it off don't check it. There you go.

I mean, have you ever taken voice lessons?
Wow.
No, it shows. You should, I mean you should walk around the office more and just sing in front of people.
Yeah.
Sounds good, man.
I was just kidding. I think you have a horrible singing voice. It's not good at all.
What was that?
Was that your mom? You talk like that to your mother?
Why? What is she doing?

Eating by yourself like a fucking loser, huh?
You're a fucking joke, Blumenfeld, you know that?
Have you even gotten laid? You ever fucked, Blumenfeld? No, I didn't think so, did you? You're a piece of shit, right?
You think you're a piece of shit? Just say you're a piece of shit.
Say it.
Yeah.
That's right.
Yeah, fuck you.
Yeah right. I wouldn't eat lunch with you to save my mother's life.
You know you're a fucking joke, man? Nobody respects you, why don't you name one person in this office that even likes you.
Wrong!
Hey, Amir, one last thing.
You failed. That's right, man. It was a test.
Can't let people talk to you like that, man. You gotta, you gotta stand up for yourself. Be strong.
Yeah.
Don't talk back to me!
Alright, see ya.
Yeah, whatever.
I bet you I can go in there and barrade Amir, ruin his lunch, come back out, and he's gonna respect me more than he ever has.
Yeah.
...
Hey.
I know, you're-- you're sitting across from me.
Nothing.
It's definitely you. We're not on the phone, Amir.
That's fine.
Ok!
What is your problem, and what is in your back?
C'mon, man.
We talked about this. I will only talk to you if--
...
...
Shut up!
...
Yup.?
Uh, went home, visited my family, you?
Sounds pretty fun, who'd you go with??
. . . Oh, you're serious.?
Why would you do that?
Why would you go camping on your own?
So the normal reaction to that is just not to go, right??
Where'd you go?
God, that's like, 3 hours away.
How did you get there?
Jesus! Are you kidding me? How much was it?
Oh my god, Amir! How do you have that kind of money to waste?
Jesus, you look really sick. ?
Yeah, you look really pale. Did you not bring food?
Are there even lakes up there?
How did you get home?
You can't change the subject.?
. . . god.
What?
Number one, Halloween is two months away. Two, we're not dressing the same, and three, blood brothers isn't a costume.
Don't! I'm- What is that?
Alright, I'm not.
Not even close.
What friends? What are you talking about?
Are you just, like, repeating stuff you heard on T.V. again?
Ok, so you are. I think I probably just shouldn't talk to you.
Ok, you're talking really strangely.
Ok, see, it's like, even that, it seems like it makes sense, but it doesn't.
You mean like a blood brother?
Ok, that doesn't count.
Do it.
Thought so.
What the hell, man? What is it?
Oh my god!
What is that?!
What?!
Hey that's not a prank on me, man.
Sarah, look at this.
It's Amir's parents having sex.
You guys!
Hey!
I know! Oh my god.
I should send this out.
Cassels, come here!
Amir's parents having sex.
Can you put my monitor back? Put it back up.
You know, for your next prank, you should just like, piss your pants in public. That would really get me.
That would be pretty good. Is there another picture on here?
What are you doing?
The pick?
Ok.
Yeah, but, that wasn't you playing. That was Will. You just cut to a close-up of Will playing.
Why don't you just play that same exact thing except no close-up shots, just a plain old shot of you playing.
Wanna take that disc and play?
Just go up.
I messed it up?
Now everybody knows, so I did mess it up.
You haven't apologized yet, but once is fine.
Nothing.
Star power.
Who's she?
Yeah.
What? Did you miss your flight?
What?
What the hell are you talking about?
No, I mean how are you on the phone?
Come on, don't say lonely. Say bored, remember?
Alright, look, this is really dangerous, I'm just going to hang up.
No, it's unsafe!
Don't. Jesus.
Yeah.
He is.
Oh my god.
What's up dude?
See ya.
What?
What's the big deal?
No.??
Well, I just told you, so. ??

Can you just work or something? Please.
I'm sure I will.
Yeah. No, yeah... That is good. I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
Don't.
No.
Kay, definitely not. Why do you need thirty bucks?
Oh, god. When?
Jesus. How have you been eating?
What are you planning on doing when the thirty dollars is up?
Ugh, never mind.
No!
No actually, I took that back.
Yeah. You know if you don't just stand up for yourself they're not going to stop walking all over you.
See, this doesn't work.
I will transmit it to your brain!
Stop.
Alright, I get it.
Just quit it!
Would you please chill out?
Stop it, please.
Don't do anything like
What the hell are you doing?!
No. I try to have a little bit of fun, and you just take it too far, every fucking time!
Oh have I!

Yeah, that's sharp.
Yeah.
Oh, wow.
This is mine now.
Thank you.
It's brand new.
Yeah.
Forever.
It's mine. Like, it's mine now.
It will not be yours now, Amir.
No, it's not!
Still mine then, right?
Boom!
I wonder how they make bubble wrap.?
Yeah . . . do, do you know?
OK, I'm listening, you have my attention now.
OK, so you obviously don't know either.
What are you looking at?
It's not c-o-r-n. ?
Stop free-styling. ?
Yeah.
Can you just try to relax? What are you doing?
Come on. Amir. Just try to work like a normal person. Please.
You mean corn on the cob.
So you've, like, been chasing the same girl for three months?
Yeah, and so this is what you got to do.
Oh god, that's digusting.

patrick: No, no, wait, wait. Finish what you were saying.
Alright. What I'm saying is you have to plant a lot of seeds and see what grows, because there's no point in just having one girl on your radar.
Nope.
Shut up, Amir.
No, you don't understand. He never really knows what he's talking about.
No, we're-
You're not a monkey.
Hey, what's that, uh, killer away mess that you throw up when you have to go #2?
That's it. I'm going to throw that puppy up there right now.
Sorry, bro.
What are you talking about? It's 9:30, go home.
Don't hit me man, alright?
What the hell is wrong with you?
What the hell is wrong with you!?
w-will you at least get me a towel? I'm getting light headed.
Don't make me follow your voice, just put it in my hand... You're kidding me!
Oh my god.
Don't try to...

What's the difference? ?
Can you even do work with your hands like that??
That's a duck. ?
Not. Closer.
Did you see what he was wearing?
Velcro shoes. Who does that? You look like a little kid, you're 24 years old.
What are you doing?
You guys, listen to this. You know there's a McDonald's by our office?
Ok, so last night I was walking home, right, and I see Amir.
Sit down, please. What are you doing, dude? You're in your pajamas.
So no shoes?
I swear to God.
It's insane. It's ridiculous.
That's an M.
That's an M.
Go.
Stop.
Sup?
No. Sometimes when I'm at home, I don't wear a shirt.
Don't, just-
I can see you moving the mouse.
Ok. Much worse.
What are you doing?
No, I have Thanksgiving dinner with my family.
MY family.
You know that's backwards, right?
And spelled wrong.
Ok. Closing this, then.
Whoa, you all right??

What results??
You don't - - you don't have like an STD, I mean you never have had . . . What is it? ?
The results for what??
What?!
No, it's not.
Do not.
'Scuse me.
Don't.
Special brownies?
Nice.
Hey Amir, don't eat those.
It's really sick. It's just incredibly morbid. Don't think about anti-drug commercials at work, okay, just do your real actual
Times they are a-what?
What'd you say?
Thought so
Hey,
Don't make it...
So you do know Jude is in there.
The good guys...
Yeah. Stop. s- That's really sad.
That's a bad thing. Heh.
Hold on...
Chill out!
Uh, this girl, that I'm kind of interested in, but we've been friends for a really long time-
I open up like an inch, and you just-
Sure.
Ok, then don't say it.
Oh, god, wish you didn't say that. Now I'm thinking about it.
I'm right here. We're having a conversation. Don't say my name in the middle of a conversation.
Ok. Yeah. We have a meeting to go to. Come on.
Why?
So, yeah, they had me do that like my first day as an intern, they told me I was way overqualified.
You know, it's not even worth insulting you because you just don't get it.
Woah. I know that look. Means you're about to do something crazy!
Oh-hoh no! Yes! No way! I'm gonna hug you. I'm gonna hug you! I'm gonna hug you, here we go!  You're my boy. You're my
What?
What?!
Why don't you just sit back at your desk.
What?
You hurt yourself? Did you hurt your ankle?
So you didn't hurt your foot, right?
So if I go right here
Jesus, I have 98 emails from facebook.
Did you send me 98 facebook gifts?
Oh my god, these are a dollar each. You know that?
How do you have that kind of money?
And he's okay with you doing this?
You don't have a girlfriend
Do you think that's a pun? God man, this is ridiculous
I just don't understand. What are you doing? Let go of my foot.
Amir what are you doing?
I'll tell you what size I am, just stop
Stop it. Stop it right now. Stop it.
Give it back now. Right now. Right the fuck now.
I really have no idea...
You don't get one.
No, you read my email.
Ugh.  Hello.
Definitely nay, it's Christmas.
25th.
Where are you, at the office?
Cool.
Can you check something.. really quick on my computer?
Not sneaky. You're just dumb.
No.
Not a resolution.  That's not how they work.
What is it?
How's that working out for you?
What's that?
How much do you weigh?
Ohh.
You're on the cusp of being grossly underweight.
I don't know, like, one sixty.
No what?
Spell it.
You know, you never cease to impress me-
-and not in a good way, how dumb you are.
What did you say, idiot?
No, I mean, I think that's all doable, and I actually don't even see the need to bring--
Sorry... God...
I was on the phone about work, oh my god!
kidding me.
Yeah.
What're you-- what exactly are you trying to do?
Just straight up over your head I guess, then.
It's fine.
barely did that right.
So movies twice, then?
Then you spelled it wrong.
Freestyle means it's off the top of your head.
That's Kanye West.
It's not. And you said it wrong.
Can you just go back to work? I need to be on the--
God!
What the fuck are you doing?
I don't care
Will you help me pick these up? Please?
So you know they're for calling people, but you don'tbut you think they're foreign rods. But they're for calling people
What script?
When?
Oh my god, Amir, whawhat do I say to that? You know that that's stupid, right?
I can hear you, and you better not fucking tape me, Amir.
Oh my
Until next time, you're my best friend, Jocelyn.
Hey, what's up dude? You here? Nice. Alright, I'll come right down. See ya.
I'm just going to pick up my friend from high school, give him a little tour.
You don't have any friends.
Just try to be polite, please? We're not gonna be here long, alright.
Chill out!
Amir.
This is my friend Josh.
Everything. I don't know where to start, I guess.
You like this guy. Cause...
Cause a minute ago you said you were gonna kick his ass.
Yeah, you know what, you guaranteed it actually.
You guaranteed you were gonna beat the shit out of him.
Taking some ibuprofen.
Would you just relax?
Jesus Christ!
Oh my god.
I'm not pissed; you just owe me ten bucks okay?
No.
Stop it! Let go!
I always hate you right now.
Obviously. Just get off of me!
People can probably hear you, alright?
Hi, I'm Jake.
He's Amir. What you saw just now was a Jake and Amir skit.
That's an opinion.
Okay, so you didn't get it then.
I mean it's not.
It's different. I'm stopping it.
So you left to get the same shirt as me?
Can we just try to get some work done before we do that, please?
You probably won't be, but fine. Not gonna argue.
Okay.
Jesus Christ, man!
Jusit's not an emergency, just call Domino's.
Don't care.
Pizza's Italian.
That's too many.
But that's still 30. Amir.
Okay then just hang up.
Hang up the phone.
Come on.
It wouldn't have been good if he believed it. I'm calling a deli.  Hi. Uh, can I have a turkey club? Uh,
Instead of that.
What kind of bread?
That's disgusting, I'm not saying that. You say it.
Oh my god, that's dis...
I lost my appetite.
Syrup?
Yeah, one 'j'.
There's an 'a' and a 'k'
What is wrong with you?
Oh hi. Nice to meet you!
Second best to Amir, but thanks.
Cannay do that, sister. Amir's my BBF  and I don't go anywhere without him.
Of course I do, that's the most hot normal fantasy ever, everyone knows that.
Uh, yeah. He actually does that all the time.
And it's pretty much awesome!
Amir can do a backflip, he just won't show us cause he's too shy.
Amir beat me at arm wrestling three times today.
Two out of three and he used both hands, but that's legal.
Amir!
Come on, you know I always wear a tie on my birthday.
Mine's down.
I would never plan you a surprise party.
What's this?
Party goes until question mark question mark.
Also ends at question mark question mark
Nobody gives a shit.
You want it?  Here you go.
Don't fucking bother.
It's after 6.  Why don't you just go home?
Final-finally, Jesus!
What are you doing?!
I organized this.
Uh, some people you work with.  Do you know them- do you know people at work?
Okay, just try to be polite and have a drink.  Ok?
Get to work.
We actually never hang out.
I see you met my cousin, Diana?
That's great.
No, chill.
It's 11:30.
He wasn't, you don't understand.
She can see you.
Just be cool.  Maybe, take a seat.
I'm leaving.
I'm not thinking of anything.
I'M NOT PLAYING!
I mean, it's all the same thing, it's all-it's all me not playing.
Good point. Good point. All right I'm leaving.
Sorry, I'm going home for the weekend. I can't do it.
You're OK? You're all right with that? Usually you freak out.
Umm, don't call me that.
But I'm glad, I guess I'm glad you're OK with it.
Uh, hey mom, it's Jake, uh, happy birthday, sorry I can't make it home, but uh, maybe I'll send you one of those donuts that you love from Kingpin Donuts, your favorite place in New York City. OK, well I'll see you in a few weeks, tell everyone that I miss them. Love you, bye.
Oh. God. What is he doing here? Who let him in?
Don't tell him.
That's my mom's!
Come on, let's go to dinner.
That sounds very racist.
Well, they don't, so, I'm sorry, you can't come.
He can't come because he's insane. I'm sorry, I'm just saying it.--
I'll show you what I mean. Here.  Move. Right off the bat I don't even have to touch anything.
No, yeah;  200 pictures in a folder labelled January 30th. That's today!
Oh my God, don't touch me.
You're right, that's not the point.  I mean look, there's a video here, too; this is insane! .)
And you should never be FUCKING RECORDING ME!
You know what, you guys go to dinner.  This is good. This is good.
You guys are perfect for each other, you know that?
I'm not your fucking brotha, and you're not invited.
Okay, number one you hate roller coasters.
Okay then, number two that's sad, and number three, every time everybody's hanging out together and having fun, you seem to ruin
Oh, I don't know, why don't we start with: earlier today when we were all sitting on the beanbag?
Butch league...
Nope, nobody noticed because nobody's here.
Everybody noticed that you weren't at work today, though.
Nope, I guess not, just me, who's here at 11 doing your work for you.
I mean... how do you even be 13 hours late to work?
Okay, well given the fact that that's sad on its own... why did it take you three and a half hours to get to work?
Nice! Is your computer in that bag?
That's disgusting, please put it away.
I mean, why are you even here? What are you doing here?
Okay, I'm 22.
Yeah, yeah you did. Jake and Amir did this work how do I hit send is this an email Jake
dot org.
You pretty much spelled my name with two 'k's, why?
Seriously though.
Twice.
Okay, how 'bout the dot org. Why is that?
Probably not.
I guess I just don't understand why anybody in their right mind would go to a website about us. Just seems really boring.
Hey guys!
What are you doing?
Yes, but I don't have any cash.
That's really far away, actually. I have an idea. Dinner's gonna be on me, hold on.
What's up, dude?
What number were you at?
Don't bother. It's my move. Can't use it.
Whispering is when you talk lower near my ear, ok? Anyway, it's not for sale, sorry.
Don't make me laugh. See you tommorow.
Sixty.
Done for eighty.
Cool. I'll do it for a hundred. No refunds.
Then you never started listening.
Actually, I'm glad you're here. Check this.  My name's Amir, and I'm a loser.
And no one likes me.
And I will never steal Jake's wallet again.
You should be able to.
You won't. I'm going to Florida.
Oh, really? Because last time I checked, I was going to Florida with my friends, and you're not my friend.
FYE?
Ok, so, wrong phrase, wrong word, and it wouldn't start with an E.
That'd be awesome.
We're far from even.
You're 25, you really need to start eating like an adult.
Ok, not what I meant.
No.
Not personal, not a question, and I said no, so...
Alright, what are you talking about?
So just say that. We're not going for the sandwiches, we're going for the beach.
Just relax, it's going to be fine.
Just relax. We're in the air. There's nothing you can do.
Don't.
We already bought stand-by tickets for the next flight.
Amir. Can I talk to you in the kitchen, please?
QQ, ass-fuck. What time did I tell you to wake me up?
11:30. What time is it now?
It's 6:30.
Look at me.
Yeah, red. I'm burnt to a crisp!
Ow!
Not knowing what supermodel to date would be a good problem to have. This sucks!
That's it. I'm done talking. You've single-handedly ruined my vacation on the first day we're here.
What is that supposed to mea--
OW! Fuck you. I'm done talking to you.
OW! God damn it! What is wrong with you?! I fucking hate you!
Is nobody seeing this?!
One last piece, I think everybody should be here
wanna get everyone?
Yo come check this out
The puzzles almost over
I'm going to bed
Okay, no.
Please speak in English. It's really annoying when I have to decipher your stupid language.
See like that.
Alright that's cheating. Come on.
And now you owe me a bag of chips. Great. Good job.
I'd- I'd just rather it's complete gibberish so that I can just zone you out entirely.
That what?
That you couldn't finish the joke? No, it's not. Do you even know what that means?
Eughhh. I shouldn't have asked. I shouldn't have asked.
No, I didn't ring you. I don't ring you. Do you even know what it says  when you call me? Call me right now.
I don't wanna hurt your feelings, but I do want to.
Stop
Hey, hey!
What are you doing?!
No you're-
You're unsuccessfully trying to close Firefox. You know I can read what you're doing on here.
Where exactly does Jake live dot com.
What is Jake's favorite color dot com, backslash is it blue, backslash grey.
That's sad. Where does Jake hang out after work dot com.
You should be.
Does Jake secretly appreciate me dot no.
What are teeth made out of dot com.
Enamel. Scale dot com.
I remember that one.
How does Google work dot com. Is this a search?
You're getting closer.
I'll give it to you.
Shit he's coming, close, close, close dot com. Then, Jake dot com. You tried to sneak one in there.
You don't get how embarrassing works. Alright, two things, okay? Number one, if you touch my computer again, I'm going to get you fired. Number two, get the fuck out of here.
Okay, Shasta McNasty.
And it wasn't the best show ever on television. Now leave.
French fries.
Thank you.
Okay, you left a picture of yourself when you were a kid on my desk.
I'm gonna throw it away.
I'll keep it on the top of my trashcan for ten.
You don't have to yell, you're standing right in front of me.
It's pathetic.
Does Jake secretly appreciate me dot no.
Not getting through this one dog!
Calm down, it's a sandwich.
Not that it's any of your business--
Mayo.
Mozzarella.
Mozzarella cheese.
And a veggie burger.
No, none of those things.
Don't be.
It's not.
You're right, no questions asked. My sandwich.
I'm the only one here that knows you, and I'm telling you that it's my sandwich.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Me too, yeah.
You don't bring food to work.
I'll choose neither.
You're not getting the sandwich.
Oh, god, I know you're serious. Here.
Said that a little early, didn't you? Now I'm not gonna give you the sandwich.
Shut up.
I did. It was terrible.
Same thing, right? It's the same thing.
Why am I so tired?
What?
What did you do?
I don't drink coffee.
What just happened?
Uh, yeah. Yes.
Really? That's great! Thanks.
AGH!
I think I just got a migraine.
I don't know.
Jesus, it's cold in here!
Why are you doing this?
Is it about work?
So not at all then.
...How?
I wanna be. I really do. Unfortunately, this is normal for you.
What are you angry?
Why are you freaking out?
No.
You okay?
I'm gonna get a soda. Try to relax, calm down.
What?
What are you doing? Oh God.
Fine.
Don't touch it.
Get what are you doing?!
Not this again...
I have an idea: why don't you just leave? Okay? Get out of here, do something else?
Jesus Christ. Listen.
You're gonna edit this thing like a
aren't you?
Five bucks.
How can you say that, Jurassic Park 2 was terrible.
Special effects? Name one good special effect in that movie.
Alright, uh, yeah, I guess I'll give you that. See this is the kind of shit we should be talking about, none of this weird... go,
What?
OK wow. Uh, I see what's going on, Patrick, why would you agree to this?
OK, that's more.
Patrick! Stop.
Come on.
Jesus Christ!
No.
Let's start lower with an actual team. North Carolina vs. Mount St. Mary.
Okay, you can't do math. Also, this isn't a scoreboard. These are their seeds.
You are though. I'm watching you.
I just wrote Indiana.
No, you're drawing a picture of me.
Because the hair's.
Stop.
You know you're an idiot, but I got Texas AM too, so.
C'mon.
That.
Ok, Those - there are two St. Mary's teams.
You can tell.
That's immature and the wrong innuendo.
It's final four.
C'mon.
It's already a movie.
It's not very likely.
It makes me sad.
Do you even have the $5 buy in?
You're just drawing lightning.
Not or whatever. You are.
Write it!
We don't.
The finals are in San Antonio. You need to pick two teams.
It's Jake. Jake wins it all.
It's my name.
Sure.
Heh...alright.
I don't think you're involved in this.
No-
Hey, don't worry.  He's kidding.  We just need to start thinking-
We ALL need to start thinking of Spring Break articles.
It's fine.
You're not stupid, Casey, obviously.  Uh, Amir's just taking a bad joke too far -
Alright, Amir.  That's enough.  You have to leave. Now!
Yeah, that's fine.
What?
Yeah.
Okay.
It's Indiana Jones.
No! Too late.  Hey, what's up?
Just say movies.
It's Freddy Got Fingered.
No, it's the only movie he's ever seen.
Okay, number one: Da Vinci PAINTED the Mona Lisa, number two: he painted plenty of other things after
No.
God, no.
It's complicated. Where is he by the way? It's been long.
Wow.
Yeah, hes sleeping.
No, those are words.
Jake, cnae find markers, got hot, thought I'd take a  snooze, wake me up pre Hercules on TNT, Amir.
I don't know.
Jake. LOL.
What's going on?
It's 9:30 where is everbody?
Oh God, what are you talking about?
Just stop, explain it
Okay, I have an email from you, and you signed it anonymous
It's very much not the same thing
I have lots of choices: one of which is to call Ricky and get you fired
You know actually I think that's pretty much it, what did you expect?
No, I don't wanna get naked
You know what, I'm gonna go home like everybody else
Come on, I don't have time for this, all right? I'm leaving.
. . . uh . . . downstairs, for a couple of seconds.
OK, you're not. Just relax. I'll be back in a few - in a minute, one minute.  Bye, everybody. Have a good weekend.
Put the camera down. Turn the camera off. What are you doing in LA? How did you get here?
So you followed me onto the plane. Where's your stuff?
Where are you staying?!
Listen. Absolutely not.
You shouldn't have yelled at her.
So did I.
Will you at least sleep head to toe?
Oh god, turn off the light then.
Come on. Ow!
It's 9:15 New York time.
Not whatever.
The pool?
He's pissed at you.
My cousin's apartment.
OK, you are definitely not.
Let me drive ri--
OK, so what is happening?
I'll take the wheel if you tell--
--me who should be driving right now. WELL HOLD ON TO IT!
Not close. Not even close at all.
Only not funny.
-And the wrong episode. Please! Just look around, does any of it look familiar? Do you see the car?
That's the first time you told me that because this place doesn't have a valet!
Yeah, I bet he was. The keys to my aunt's car, right?
About how to get the car back?
Man, you lost the c--
It's eight!
It's eight thirty and just relax, we're meeting my friends at In and Out.
It's-it's like McDonalds, just shut up, please.
Hey!
Can you--
Oh my god!
Let go of my fucking head.
No.
Yeah, you should though. You should at least do me do me that courtesy.
It's sad.
Come on, what's the rule?  Don't talk to me, unless -
Play?  Did I get play?
Okay, new rule: No talking to me unless you have a question, SPECIFICALLY pertaining to
Fine.
Okay, stop talking.
Okay, nobody calls chicks fine or says play.  THAT'S your problem.
Yeah, you're like an 8th grade nerd.
Okay, you're yelling.
Are you serious?
Okay.
Okay, that's like pathetic.
You're a nerd.
You're a nerd.
YOU'RE A NERD!
Don't do that.
Wow, you're actually bleeding.
You took my wallet, right?
All right, do you want me to help you up?
Say my name and I'll help you.
Say my real name and I'll help you.
Listen, Amir. You're hurt. Say my real name, and I'm going to help you.
No.
You don't have to upload it.
It is true. Say my name.
Here.
I barely even touched it yet!
Oh my god...

sarah: Let's give Amir the quiz.
No, it's just going to be depressing.
No we didn't.
Okay here you go, question one.  How often do you eat vegetables?
You don't eat vegetables ten times a day.
No, he's being serious.  How much fruit do you eat?
Kay, she's being polite.  She meant to say, "Of course it's not, obviously, you fucking retard."
Okay, I'll skip this question about vitamins because I assume you don't know what those are.
No, watch this.  Amir, what does "sparingly" mean?
He just has them.
Stop.
According to this, you should have been dead ten years ago.
See, you don't even do that.
Will you at least pick that up?
Wow.
No, that's not it, you're always like seven hours late.
I'm surprised you're not fired.
Do you not remember yesterday?
Hey, Amir, come on.
Alright just sit down, please.
Jesu-
Yea
So you lost your glasses is that um I'm not gonna guess
Do you know what Lasik means?
Ok for a reason.
How many fingers am I holding up?
When have you seen 18 fingers?
Ok you know it had to be between 1 and 5
You know lasik is when they cut tiny flaps into your eyes to correct your vision?
Yea you know. So you also know they shoot a laser into your eye while your

It hurt when they strapped you down and shot lasers into your eyes..
Ok put your glasses back on
No I don't.
That's me owing you a dinner, which I already said no to.  There you go

amir: Jake!
Oh my god. Two questions: why and how?
Ok, those are two answers, just not to those questions.
How did you know it was me? I took off my shoes so you wouldn't see.
Then I guess why.
No, I told Pat that I was going to the bathroom, and I asked him to tell you not to come.
Do I have to answer that?
God, that's disgusting.
Shut up.
Ah!
I am not telling you, 'cause I know it's for that stupid log you're keeping of my clothes.
That's telling you, right?
I'm not saying.
Don't call me that.
Yeah, I don't know, actually.?
Like me.
So Vince, Jake, combined. ?
Uh, QQ.
What does P.A. mean??
It does matter, because you just lied to Vince.
OK, he respects you for 24 hours until he finds out you were lying to him. ?
OK.?
Parks, beaches, museums . . . ?

amir: And Americans are doing it in record numbers. ?
OK, do you even know what that means??
I don't know how Diana puts up with you.
What?! You guys are getting married?
She didn't say anything. You just said she was your fiance. ?
OK, I usually do.
Oh.My.God.
Don't.
I guess that's better.?
Fine.
OK, now you need to shut up. ?
Yeah.?
Jesus.
What???
Yeah.
I said 'Yeah'.?
OK, what's the big deal?
I wish I knew.
I don't know. ?
Look, I know he's weird, but look, Diana, you have to-you have to do this yourself, OK? He's sensitive. ?
Amir...
I need to talk to you. ?
Amir...
I need to talk to you.
Diana told me something.
She wants to break up with you. ?
Umm...
Sh-She probably likes you too much.
It happens to everybody.
I'm trying really hard to--
Probably not.
OK, I was right.
All right, what do you mean by 'the one'?
What is 'the one'?
All right, come on, uh, dinner tonight. ?
McDonalds, let's go, right now!?
OK, well, whatever you--
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry.
I didn't say that.
Yeah, they're fine.
What?
What the fuck did you do, man?
I don't believe you... just tell me what you put in my food cos I might need to go to the hospital and get my stomach pumped...
Oh my god, this is a fucking nightmare.
I don't want this to be how I die.
What is it?
Oh my God.
Oh man not the Visine.
You have to call 911.
911!
SHUT UP!
Hi, mom. Yeah, I'm here now actually. Of course I'm excited, I got the keys this morning. Yeah, it's closer to him but if I let him decide where I'm going to live, he wins. I'm going in, I'll call you back. ?
Ughhhh?
Oh, Jesus.
God damn it. All right, that's your one weird picture for the month, all right? Look at me. You understand? That's it.
No.
If you're asking me seriously--
My mom's dad, because I never got to meet him--
John, his name is John.
OK, what are you even doing?
I don't know what your interests are, what did you do last night?
OK, so say that, say meeting new people. Even though I know that's a lie!
Is it easy or are you asking me?
OK, um, I really like Billy Joel and you spell that  I space A-M-
space R-E-
T-A-R-
Uh-huh.
Just google it, OK? Google it.
That's guys.
OK.

amir: Nothing right?
I'm not getting involved.
You're not wearing any shoes.
OK, it's raining.
Yeah, and there's twenty thousand dollars up for grabs, so we're gonna go around, and talk to some gamers, and--  --and Amir's here!  What.. Amir!  What are you doing?
It's pwning.
You're like number two on the leaderboard!
It's fifteen hours.
Don't call him that.
It's just lame.
Sarah??
What are you doing?
Okay.
You have sauce on your face.
Dad, what's up? It's late. ?
How?
At least you're getting smarter. Still annoying. Smarter.
I-uh, yeah.
That's not enough sleep.
OK, goodnight.
Why--
--do you keep calling me?
Bye.
Hanging up.
You just call me back.
I could turn off my phone.
If you like me, if you respect me, don't you just want to be nice to me? Maybe, in time, I could learn to be your friend.
?
What are you doing?
No, you shouldn't.
Ahh.
Ahhh!  Amir!
What is that?
commercial!
Oh my God.
Jesus. You know what actually, why I don't I just... I'll play these out loud.
Maybe this will teach you a lesson.
Maybe, I honestly don't know.
Cover for you?
Do you want me to be the one to play Snood all day? Why don't I stop working? Right? It'll be just like you're here.
Nope.
What?
You don't want to eat dinner with me tonight?
Not even if I go to McDonald's?
Okay...
...Fair enough.
You don't want to get dinner? Maybe you want to go away with me this weekend? Going to Boston...chicken nugget festival.
That's fine. We're just going to be eating french fries all day. And you know what? We're not going to be reading any books the entire weekend.
I'm not going to make a scene, just leave.
It's all the same women's sweater.
No I don't.
Get off of me. It's $350 anyway I can't afford it.
Not quite.
Why?
That's mine.
How can you afford $900 for a jacket when I can't?
22
Yeah, it really just feels good to get away from work.
It's not so much the job--
Yeah, I'm feeling better now.
Oh I think Pat might be coming.
Cassels! What took you so long, man?
For...
Oh, wow.  You really need to learn how to defend yourself.
Nonexistent.
Same answer.
Sorry.
SHHHH Shut up!
She's def-initely not.
Don't.
You will probably build me up... ...Go ahead.
It's really working.
She actually thinks I'm cute! She likes me!
K..
Hey
Sup.
Cool. I actually just took one of those shits where you don't have to wipe at all. Really cool.
Yeah, really good.
You love those?
And after, after that, I pissed blue. Isn't that weird?
You've done that?
Eheheh It's like whoa!
Exactly. And to-- instead of washing my hands, I just peeled the skin off of my palm , and I just rinsed it out under the faucet, and I slid it back on like a glove.
You did say that, right after I did. Tell me something crazy that happens to you.
Talking about me, so
Something that I haven't mentioned already. Something just.. happened to you.
Something.. tell me something, about you, that's crazy.
Can I see it?
Twelfth floor?
Don't--
Oh my god.
We're not!
He's not going to go- This is his job, he doesn't sleep.
He can hear me through your hand . . . We're stuck in the elevator--
That would surprise me a lot, actually.
What are you talking about?
Oh, dude, come on.
What are you doing?!
It's been three minutes.
Shut up.
Yeah.
Mention that what?
Yeah, you don't plan freestyles.
No.
Yeah. I agree.
Right, right. I told you to work on the vide-
Alright, so you sat down, you got to work, and you just, you thought of just taking the first letter-
Even taking ten minutes to do that, though, is kinda pathetic.
Yeah, oh my God.
No, I don't.
Don't.
Ew.
Dinner tonight?
Ok, no. You know I wasn't. I would never ask you to dinner.
Sorry you came
dont do that anym-
Just get to the question
Nine
Alright That's so dumb
No
No I don't wanna hea--
Two. okay so it sounds like the same answer. Seven
Do you realize how stupid you sound. It's like me saying hey would you rather have a billion dollars or the nicest apartment in New York City.
Okay you know what all that money was fake now you're broke and you're homeless and you
you see it's stupid  you can't change--
It's not a real- It didn't really happen it's a riddle and-
No you got- You sold it. sold it for the answer to the riddle
It's not a real thing
It didn't happen
You're not a fucking retard
Alright I'm gonna go
Is there somebody there?
I'm gonna kill you!
Amir?
I'm so sorry.
Put this on, put this on on your eye.
I'm so sorry.
This is... Amir, is this... is this that stupid pilot thing that you're doing?
Hey, guess what? You're a double agent.
You're a double... you're a double agent, Ace-
... or Jocelyn, or whatever the fuck your name is.
This, this right here, this is a finger-blasting gun and it shoots invisible lasers and I'm gonna shoot you.
Get on your knees, right now. Get on your knees.
You have ten seconds to get out of here-
... crawling on your knees like a dog, before I shoot you in the face-
No, telling you would mean I have to talk to you, so no, I'm not going to tell you anything.
Well I paid for both of yours.
Yeah I guess so, I guess so.
Be my guest, please.
Cuz you ruined the game for me.
I didn't buy you that fucking hat!
I didn't even do that!
Nope. Just stop talking, actually. That's good.
How about I just walk home and you take the subway by yourself?
Aight look, I don't think I should be seen with you, just in case they're still looking for you, alright? Nothing personal, just get the fuck away--
Sure.
Nope.
No I wouldn't.
I said I'd take a picture, I didn't say anything about saying we were best friends. Now MOVE the camera.
Just ask it.
No, do it again.
Yeah. Not bad.
Um, I guess even it out.
I think you just have to take that front chunk.
Take the front chunk. Sarah come here.
And uh, you just have to even it out, just take it all.
Scratching thing.
No I think you, it's really uneven. You gotta go-
Yeah.
Yeah, it's not as much as you think it is.
I know.
Just work through it.
It's gonna look ace!
There you go.
It's not that much. It's honestly not as much as you think.
There you go.
Girls are really gonna like that, right?
I think-
Amir...get the back.
Shut up.
What just happened?
Ok let's do this: I ask a question, you ask a question, we can trade off.
Okay
Yes. Why did you just do that to Rosie?
Okay?
I don't know, probably grey.
Ok fine, it's grey it's grey!  It's gonna be grey!  Do you feel like what you just did was at all inappropriate, s- for work?
It's-  a crew neck.
Shut up. Just shut up.
Now that it's all said and done, do you feel at all sorry for what you did, keeping in mind he was crying when they took him to the hospital?
Amir.
Oh my god--
Yeah it has writing on it. . Do you think there's any way in the future we can try to control your outbursts? Anything we can do at all?
Yeah it's the ATT shirt.
You know you could have just asked me from the beginning what exact shirt I was gonna wear tomorrow?
Woah. Did you get this email?
Did you get this email?
Where were you 4th of July weekend?
You went home?
OK. Are you sure you went home 4th of July weekend?
It was a weekend. Friday.
Just so you know this email is a surveillance video that security took because they want to know who this was staying in
Come over here and watch this video with me.
Alright, so that's not you dancing?
Alright, how about...this is... who's this in a penguin costume saying Jake over and over again?
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
OK. How about when this guy comes right up to the camera?
Just go.
What?
What?! Yeah, an empty cup, okay.
No.
Just cause you say it in a goofy voice doesn't make it normal.
Oh God.
Now you're quoting Rob Thomas. Get over here.
I don't want you to say stuff like that to me.
I don't want you to say stuff like--
Don't tickle me. DON'T TICKLE ME AMIR! I DON'T WANT YOU TO TICKLE ME AT WORK ANYMORE!
Okay, so. Don't tickle me, and don't quote Rob Thomas at me--
Or say that I'm the one bright spot in your otherwise dismal life.
Okay? Cause you're being a FUCKING weirdo.
All right, bye. Go.
Jake. That was really mean! Yeah, he really looked up to you.
You don't understand. He's already forgotten it even happened.
No, my number wasn't a Q.
I don't know, that one's facing you.
Same answer, right?
I'd rather... I... Just answer your phone, how 'bout... that's... infuriating.
Answer it.
Hey.
Well, then just talk.
OK.
What was that?
Does she?
What does that even mean?
If that's, I mean, if that's a classic example, I would say--
That's really... that's a really noble profession.
You don't know, 'cause noble's a good thing.
Yeah, I think about it--
What answer could I possibly say?
Okay...
Do you even know what that means?
recoiling Well I don't have any tips for you.
Okay, here's what you do: you're going to go out there, confidently, compliment her, ask her out, just don't be you.
It's Hallie?
Ah... I don't know. Um, forget it. I don't think you should ask her out. I thought you- I thought you were talking about somebody else.
She's not right for you. Hallie's crazy. She takes drugs.
You do?
Yeah... actually, you know what? I think you should go for it. Just go ask her out, be yourself.
Good luck.
Sorry.
She's not my girlfriend anymore.
She's not my girlfriend anymore.
Her shoes are normal.
Alright. You know, just keep talking to her okay? It's working. Just talk to her like you talk to me, right Pat?
Good luck.
Okay, I think she's actually laughing at him.
I'm trying to listen. Hold on.
Oh my God, did she just say yes?
Yeah, the punch.. Okay shut up. Just shut up about that. Alright? Can you hear this? Shut up, shut up Pat.
How was your date?
I can't, you tell me.
Is that what you wore last night?
Is that what you wore last night.
Ok, I'm just going to ask Hallie.
Sup!
If you're doing this to get back at me, squeaky voice Tis nay working! Tis nay working! So...
QQ, did you fuck him, straight up.
They smell like chicken nuggets, you slut.
Oh wow! Yeah, I'll get away from you, right away, if-
Excuse me, Sarah, Get the fuck away from my computer right now. Amir, Bye-
Bye, bye

running toward a park bench singing Ace and Jocelyn, Ace and Jocelyn, from space or whatver, astronaut accountants nah nah nah stops singing Hallie, Jocelyn, sorry to interrupt your date or whatever the fuck you think this thing is, but I have reason to believe that Hallie is actually an alien from a rival accounting agency across the galaxy.
Don't tell me she's already used her amnesia ray on you, that stupid wench.
'fraid not, Jocelyn; time is of the essence.
Alright, listen. Straight up-

So you're saying there's a chance!
All right, bye.
Yo! Birthday drinks tonight?
...you're not still pissed abou--
All right, cool, well I'm going to go. If I'm not back in 5 minutes, just wait longer! ...but I am probably just going to go, so...
Somebody stop me!
Home.
All right.
All right.
Stop!
Yes, I have.
OK, can I have my phone?
Sans phone. Sans phone.
Yeah, you're crying about it right now.
What is it?
It's a condom holder.
I didn't want it to be that.
Can I just have my phone, actually?
Oh my god! Seventeen missed calls.
Ten text messages.
Nope. It's Pat. He says that everyone is at Cullen's.
Honestly what?
What?
OK.
Straight up, I'm going to go to Cullen's.
It's Pat. He says everybody is at Cullen's. I'm going to go to Cullen's.
OK, just relax.
Hey! Were you in on this?
OK, stop.
This is- We're in the bathroom, OK? There's no more private space.
Exactly, surprise.
Yeah.
No, we should talking about how you're going to get the hell out of here, OK? All these people here that you hate? They're actually my friends, and they don't like you.
Just wait here for 30 seconds, OK?
That's the surprise.
Yup.
Well I made--
I'm going to talk to Dan about a script I wrote.
It's- it's- you can- It's cuttable, right? You can cut that.
What's he talking about?
More specifically.
That's the opposite of what he just said.
That's the exact opposite of what he said.
There's a lot of good, short movies.
He drew a picture of a fireball.
Well, yeah, I couldn't- I  couldn't agree more.
Yep.
How did you learn those words?
Just have one more crack at rewriting it.
Hey, Hamden Hall, how's it going? Welcome to the Collegehumor office--AGH!
Don't touch me. Don't touch me.
Mike, sorry, I don't know that this is a good day for it--
What?
What are you--
It was never a joke.
Why would you do it today then? You have to edit it, right?
All right, all right, it's fine. He's not going to hurt you. Let's just, we're going to go to my apartment, I'll give you a tour of that and you're going to get an A and it's going to be great, OK?
D-Don't fucking call him that, OK? Not--I'm sorry, I'm sorry. He's not mad at you, I'm mad at him.
Don't tell me to hold on!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You know I didn't mean that. Just, I mean, don't-don't tell me to hold on.
Hey, uh Mike, this is where the magic happens.
Amir, can I talk to you for one second?
I-I need you to treat this delicately, OK?
I don't want Mikey to freak out but I think I call to go to the hospital.
Yeah, you were crazy. You ruined it.
Where do I even start?
What are you doing?
Alright, watch and learn, boys.
How- how long-
You can answer that.
Hey, are their any taco shells left?
I haven't had any.
Okay, good. Not cuz I'm ashamed of reading, though; I don't want anyone to know you were here.
We're-- We'll both go long. Ok? Relax?
I didn't email you!
Dun dun!
Haha!  Amir's here!
Love that! Make yourself at home, comprende!
Stop-- stop it!
Me and Rosie were actually just talking about you, and I realized how much I hate him.
Nah, I actually borrowed it from that zero, Patrick Cassels!
I'll take you out and buy your own copy, right now.
I will!
Don't even ask, man. You know the answer!
Cassels, d'you wanna know what really happ--
What's your plan?
You're just-- you're gonna do that every single time I try to talk--
--for the rest of my life? Okay. You're not gonna be next to me forever.
Okay, here's what happened:
Okay, here's what happened:
How many is that?
What do my tri's look like?
Aw, dammit! Amir's here.
What.
Aah. God, I hate that.
Okay. Make yourself at home, right?
Stop.
Stop it!
You know, me and Rosie were trying to hang out by ourselves, okay? Can't you let us be alone for five seconds? You know how much I dislike you?
It's a DVD, alright? I borrowed it from Patrick Cassels, and he was gracious enough to let me borrow it. Don't mess it up.
Why?
Okay, it's my story, right? So let me tell it: and he was doing the high voice and everything. He was like,  I'm gonna break your DVD! I'm going to break your DVD.
Cassels, I'm getting there.
I'm asking you politely: please calm down.
Don't even ask that, okay? You know the answer.
Jesus Christ...
And then he just broke it in half.
Y'know, Rosie was there! Why don't we ask him?
Y'know, Rosie was there! Why don't we ask him?
Rosie! Look at me. Rosie. How many have I done?
Shut up. You know I have weak ankles.
Anyway... how do my tri's look?
Fuck you. They're ginormous.
God dammit, Amir's here. This sucks.
What.
I hate you.
So you think you're at home? This isn't your home.
Shut the fuck up.
Can me and Jeff please just have one night to ourselves without you barging in here like an asshole? Do you even know how much I fucking hate you?
You see this? This--
It's-- it's Seth Rogen, okay? Everybody knows that.
It's not my DVD, so put it the fuck down.
You're gonna scuff it up.
Don't even ask me that, okay? You know the ans--
Are you crazy? Let me-- give it--
I don't care! I want you out of my life!
Okay. You know what? I feel bad.  Here.
Did you know that if too much blood flows into it, his dick can actually explode?
I'm kidding.  Got you!
Ok, that's weird, because that's the opposite of what I want to happen.
Doesn't really make sense here.
No, you're explaining it fine.
Just, yeah, in the middle,  I know. I get it. I just don't want it, I don't want it to hit any part of me at all.
Well, some people might say that I have to, I have the tough job of ex- trying to convince you not to throw it.
Still, I could probably say something like-  Oh. What happened?
You Ok?
Yee, you're Ok.
Yee, Ok, what did you hurt?
You're just...
You're grunting.
Oh. Why does- Did you- Are you sure you didn't hit your hand with a hammer?
Your head doesn't, your head looks fine. Your hand, though, looks really bad.
No, I can see bone.
Doesn't explain the bone.
Right, yeah.
Yeah, I dunno, I think I'm right, but it's a good idea. Why don't you take a nap, maybe we'll go to the hospital when we-
Hey!--
I hate you.  Look, we wanted to make a new video to announce our brand new website--
--Our brand new website design.  And you should check it out if you're in your RSS reader or your tumblr dashboard. Just go to jakeandamir.com--
--It's not.. a Ma- it's not a Magic Eye, actually.
Right. It's not, because that was a bad idea, and it's disgusting.  But, Amir's brother Ben, and our friend Amir Cohen, uh, coded and designed the whole thing for us.
Yeah, cuz they have full-time jobs, it was really tough.
What did you do today at work?
And you threw up.
It wouldn't hurt my-  I mean why wouldn't they like the design?
No. This is the end of the video.
Hello?
Sup?
Sup?
What? Hello?
Hello?
I'm going to hang up, who is this?
No, you should not. Who is this?
Sam, what are you doing?
That sounds horrible. What was the bet?
That's a very stupid bet to take.
Yeah.
I'm not surprised. I'm sad.
No, brotha, you should not.
So he's already through, right?
Well, it's not debatable, that was him.
Dump that, I'm not coming. I'm - I said no.
Oh nice, well why don't I put this in Amir's language then, I am nay fucking coming!
Dinner for one - make a note that that's really sad, I'm going to hang up now.
It's just the skin and the sauce, Sam. That's his special
The skin and the sauce.
That's disgusting. Ay, listen. Amir, new bet, right now, I bet you...
From, from here down to Houston. Okay, Amir look, new bet, I bet you can't go 5 seconds without saying my name.
Yo, Sam, you're my secretary now.
Oh hey Pat,
Can I ask you about your book?
I just want to know what you're reading actually.
Oh, you know I've heard of that. What's...
I'm sorry-I'm sorry yeah.
No.
You're just gonna believe him?
No that's not how it works!
Yeah what a great idea, move into an apartment with my best friend  over there.
What?
Fuck you!
No, actually.
Why don't you shut up for ten minutes, and I can tell you that Sarah and I have been best friends since we were little, and she's gonna know everything.
What is my favorite movie?
Okay, you're ruining it for Sarah, right?
Yeah, that's easy.
It's Annie's macaroni and cheese, good job interrupting.
Straight close.
Here's one, and Amir's gonna shut up.
Exactly.
Fuck, how did you know that!?
Called you?
I'm thinking!
It's Freddy Got Fingered.
Oh my god. We are BFF's.
No, actually
Why don't you shut up for 10 minutes and i can tell you that Sarah and I have been best friends since we were little, and she's gonna know everything, alright, ready?
What is my favourite movie?
Okay, you're ruining it for Sarah, right?
Of course, it's easy
What's my favourite food?
It's annie's macaroni and cheese, good job, interrupting
Str-Straight close
Here's one, and Amir's gonna shut up, what's my moms job?
Exactly
ffFUCK, HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT?!
She called you?
IM THINKING!
What is my favourite movie?
It's freddy got fingered
What's my favourite food?
What's my mom's job?
Oh my god, we are BFFs!
Yeah, well it--
How cold is your fridge?
OK, then yeah, it's really bad. Knowing you it's probably very-
Yeah, ugh-
-that's very gross.
Why are you getting impatient with me? This is the first time you've asked me.
OK
So you just waited 8 hours to re-ask me?
Oh my god! It smells terrible over here.
What did it smell like before that?
I think that's what I'm smelling, actually.
What is it?

amir:  --OK, just chill for a second, you're not the 'Jake' so you don't have to get all--
I seriou--all right, fine.
Who's- and then who's the Jake if I'm the Amir?
I told you not to do that anymore, all right.
Bye.
All right, fine, open up your browser.
I know, I know, here it is right next to the snood--
Internet Explorer 6, huh?
That's impressive.
6 ovah.
I got it.
OK.
I'm done.
Now pick a password.
Don't say Jake.
Um, maybe, this your pay stub?
Use the last four digits of your social -- you make $120,000 a year.
Whoa, whoa I said you could sit here quietly and bounce as long as you didn't interrupt anything I was doing.
Um... wow. Oh, geeze. That's tough. Where are the nuggets from?
Oh, from the D's, from the D's...Um, I guess definitely the money. I'd take the infinite amount of money.
Oh, uh--
No, I'd probably put it into a bank or something. Uh, like, where would you put your infinity nuggets?
In your stomach. Okay, that would kill you. You would die.
Straight up, you have a human stomach and you would die. Here's a would you rather from me.  Would you rather go onto your side of the desk and just--do some work and let me appreciate you and value our friendship  because you respect me or--
Or would you rather be a fucking loud piece of crap--
Know that you're being--
What is that, you're just not gonna let me talk--
Fine. Of what?
Great.
Amir? What's up, is everything okay? What's the emergency?
Yeah, you told me exactly where to come.
So no emergency?
No, I wasn't ever confirmed. You called me five times begging me to come here. You wept on the phone.
Okay, tell me if you remember leaving me these three voice mails.
Okay what is it?
A lip dub?
In an abandoned church in Poughkeepsie.
So what's the emergency?
Yeah, it's an emergency you're causing. I guess I'm glad I came here to stop you from burning down a church.
I'm gonna go.
Jesus. I'm gonna go!
No.
No!
Yeah, comin' down now.
Stay there.  There.
Where...
Is that my router?
That's.. is that my router?
Yeah. You got the same one as me?
Same box an' everytang.
That's so weird.
It's so weird that you would-- Um.. where did you get it?
So did I. What website did you go to? Maybe we went to the same one.
Yeah yeah.
It's- Are you.. are you gonna use it? You know, plug it in, spin it around, do all that--
You're spinnin' it. That is just.. so fun. Careful, it gets hot!
Yeah, it gets really really hot.
No, I know.
You just-- Smells good, right?
Alright, I'm gonna take this back.  What are you listening to?
Ok what do you want?
You want to vote?
Do you think that's a real law?
That asks if you are a US citizen.
I'm so mad I understood all of that.
You can't do that.
Is that, is that a real guy?
No you can't do that, election is November 4th.
No, it's not.
Maybe you shouldn't...
Democratic.
Republican.
I can't decide if you're being pointing or stupid.
Got it, stupid.
Obama is the democratic, black dude.
John McCain is the old white dude.
Don't talk like that.
Sorry, good.
You done?
A lot of people are taking into account the VP candidate.
Yes, which you know stands for...
Vice President. Rainbow?
Who's the last person you voted for?
How old are you?
Ok, so you're just not smart.
By a lot.
Don't do that.
Ok, what's your address?
No to both.
That was, that was actually clever. That was kind of clever, you should write that down.
What are you doing?
stop talking like that.
Let's do that.
Ok, rules are as follows: you're allowed to stay here--
Ok, incorrect. Every inning you stay here is a week that you're not allowed to talk to me.
Before, ok,  um no it's gonna be future weeks. Got it?
Oh!  That's gone.
I'm gonna call Kunal.
Yeah. He loves the Red Sox. I'm gonna  rub this in his face.
Uh, yo dude, I--
Hey, Kunal, it's Jake, ahh, just call me back, alright? We'll ahh, I just gotta talk to you. Alright. See you later.
Stop stop stop stop stop stop noww...
It's eleven to one.
Wrong player, wrong sport, wrong team, and that pronunciation of Kobe's name: intentional?
Wrong pronunciation of the name. That is a record for you.
Not a good one.
Not a word.
No one else is here, and you came from the front of me, so that's pretty easy--
. Use too much paper, huh?
Ohh my God.
Where is everybody? I invited everyone over like an hour ago.
Who is it?
Hey- oh
I'm really busy.
It's never been a code for that.
No, alright, I have someone coming over, and you have to leave.
Amir! I mean Jocelyn! There's a... there's a black hole in the bathroom, we can't go in there! We have to... run to the top of Manhattan! Right now!
Yeah I'm right behind you, ready 3 2 1, don't look back, go!
Good.
Uh, this is my friend Rima.

No, if you wanna know how the build got made, go to IndieMogul.com and subscribe. That's.. what you're supposed to say--
What are you doing?
Let's find out. ?
Uh, nothing.
It was.?
Yeah, no. ?
Uh, come back. Don't investigate! It was just a cat!?
You're not, it's fine. ?
Why'd you do that?
I know it works every time, I'm asking you why you do it every time. ?
You haven't answered my question.
Well, if you're going to watch SyFy, you should probably at least pay for half the cable.
My pizza!?
I see what you're doing and I still don't want you to do that. And how come you can pick off pepperonis with your hands but they go right through dishes when it's your turn to wash them? How does that work?
You're gross.?
I don't know! Because I guess I'm asking you not to.
Nope.?
OK, don't! ?
Uhh...
What are you doing??
OK, get up.  ?
OK, so get up!
What is this?!
Disgusting! Why are you on my computer in the first place?
How about you just leave?
Really? Why don't you just get me a towel?! Right now!
No, I haven't and I don't want you going on my Facebook any--?
Awesome.
Thank you.
Why are you still here?! ?
No, I mean, why are you still in my room?
Don't just turn invisible, I know you're still here.
Did you download Kazaa? ...I thought this was dead, like you.
Yes.
Okay, today is the most important day of our lives.
Don't... swear, but that's the correct message. Everybody needs to vote.
Well you can't... you can't be 9.
No, don't... what are you, what are you doing?
You can't give my phone number out. You know, don't tell me
It might not... it might not count if you live those places because you have to be an American citizen.
It sounds... it sounds smart but I know it's not because you don't mean it as a metaphor. Today is the day, this is it-
Well, it's personal I'm not gonna-
Don't touch me!!
E.
V-O-T-E vote. Everybody has a voice.
That's... not what I meant so...
That's not even close to being true. Why are you still watching this video?! Go vote!
No, well... vote for... vote for president though.
Hey look, promise me you'll take the number out.
Okay, thanks.
Get out of my apartment now.
You don't have a reason to be, so.
I remember, you tried- yeah, you tried to run into them.
Looks empty.
There's one in your mouth now.
Will you please put those away? I'm trying to teach you to eat like a regular person.
Just look at the menu, ok? Just see if there's anything you can eat that's not a nugget.
You pay a dollar off the Dollar Menu for a nugget, right?
How many packs a day do you buy?
K well- th- what're you-
Exactly! It's...
I.. I didn't.. understand that one.
Did you say the whole thing? Like I'm gonna sneeze but then it went away?
That's disgusting.
That's a penny.
It's.. one cent. So you're not.--
I'm not.. I don't wanna tickle your nose.
Let's just make normal conversation that doesn't make me wanna throw up.
...
Hey, question.
No. Did you delete all my computer files?
Why?
Just one way, really.
The other way?
Gotcha.
-if you do, damned if you don't.  All right, but you did.

amir: Or should I say, absol-fruit-ly.
I think absolutely works.
Oh, you broke my keyboard too, huh?
Fo' sho', fo' sho'.  How would you feel if I broke your computer?
OK, so you understand that it's annoying--
No. That's an example like--
I said I didn't, OK? I was saying 'if' just--
I'm not apologizing. I didn't do anything, so...
I'm not-I'm not going anywhere, OK? I have to stay here and try to recover my files.
Well, I backed them up recently so...
And this is not snake eyes.
Never bring your own dice, take them away.
Which one- Which one did you insist on being in the beginning?
Okay.
Well, you're eating my hotel right now, for starters.
Thinking, you are in jail. You roll doubles and you're out though, so it's not a big deal.
I already own it.
So, that's $950.
40.
That's $20.
You can't do that. You can't- You can't own chance.
Okay, you know why I called you in here?
No, I have - Damn it!
I want you to sign up for a dating service.
No, no, no, no. I don't care if you're interested or not, okay. I need you to leave me alone. Meet new people.
God, fine.
It's "Krick".
Well, I'll put it in.
Okay, relationship status.
Mingle, I think you mean.
That's kind of nice.
AKA a, okay.
Gross.
How often do you drink?
You never drink alcohol?
Okay, your height.
What?
So you think your fingers are inches, but you only have nine of them.
Eye color.
Nope.
Still no.
Closer.
Alright, distance you want your match to be.
Okay so--
Got it. So 3 miles.
Get--!
Alright. Interests. What do you do for fun?
Okay, so laser tag.
...
Stop there.
How often do you work out?
Kay, well I'll put "never" cause there's no--
Okay, describe your education.
K through 12?
What race best describes you?
Okay. I'm just- I'm gonna put that you're racist.
Okay. I think we're done. We just need to upload a picture of you.
Eugh.
Yeah, you are covered in juice.
I smell it. I can smell it. Was that recently?
It's 15.
I don't-
What are you doing?
How did you get up there?
Yup.
Cool.
Got it.
What?
Your TALKING is bothering me.
Don't!
You got a Twitter?
That was unnecessarily mean.
Do you even know what a Twitter is?
I'll understand words.
How's that?
Albert Gore. And I think Twitter's actually--
...Actually a great way to keep your secrets. Good call, good call.
No..
What's your Twitter's name?
Right, you use that for everything.
Not.. saying it's a good thing.
...I guess. I don't,, what does it matter if it's a th- yeah it's a- obviously--
w
Okay, let me explain  the economic crisis to you so you don't embarrass yourself in another meeting like that.
Okay, it's not about fish. Or ice. Dave Coulier, Dinosaurs...
Bangs or banks?
Bangs or banks, what did you say?
So a lot of people couldn't pay back these loans.
Gah!
Dont. You're Twittering.
Dear Twitter, No idea what Jake is talking about.
I didn't say thank you.
Stock Market.
You're not going to get me to go to a bar.
Stop freaking out.
What are you doing?
Not when you say them.
Those are words that I said but there were other words in between them and they weren't in that order so...
No that's Puff Daddy. No that's the plot of the first Star Wars movie. No that's you trying to speak pig latin. No and that's offensive to Asian people. No, that's the sound of your head banging on wood. No, you're talking about deep fried oreos covered in cake...
If you're just going to watch time-lapse videos, maybe you should go back to your desk.
With you're own computer!
Hi, I'm Jake and this is Amir and we're--
Well--
Hi, I'm Jake and this is Amir and--
We already did a voting PSA.
It is, actually. Now it's too late to vote.
It's too early, then.
Hi--
Shut the fu--
Hi--
Hi--
OK, done. Stop it.
And we're here to tell you that the deadline to accept submissions--
No.
Hi, I--
Hi, I'm Jake--
And we're here to tell you that the deadline--
Amir, don't!
We just want to say that the final--
Me either.
So the final deadline to accept submissions--
Relax, right? You're in pain.
Yeah, good work.
Hey, I'm jake, and that was Amir. We just want to say that the final deadline to accept your Webby submissions is December 19th.
Nobody.
Relax!
Sam.
It's what?
Awesome.
Look. I have to know. Did sarah talk to any guys last night?
Thank god.  You know it's- What was that?
That's fine. This whole Sarah thing is just really getting to me.
Are you serious? You tried to cheer me up about it last night.
I'm stressed out because I'm in love with her. Oh my god.
I'm in love with her.
What was that?
Shut up about the wind! Sorry. It's not you, it's just the thought of Sarah with another guy-  You know?
Ahh!
Ahh!
AHH!
AHH!
Good. Good, that was good.
Let's chill in your room.
Why don't I save you some time and give you Pat's number, so you can go fuck him.
Please don't right now.
I don't want to hear that from you.
Why do you do this?
Kind of.
Sarah.
You don't have to say anything. Let's just go back to the way we were.
I just--
Ah.
It was a joke. It was a joke.  Sarah--
It was a joke.
Say your own name.
God.
I though we said we weren't doing gifts this year.
Because every year you've gotten me something really weird.
Thanks, man.
No.
No, that wasn't me.
I'm not even sure I know what a kaleidoscope is.
It sounds really broken.
There's, like, over a thousand dollars in here.
I do now.
Thanks.
What?
What do you mean? Not what you said.
Just say it.
Ugh, Ok.
Alright.
Ahh! What? How did you- What is that?
For what?
I don't have the wolf anymore, Ok?
The wolf's dead, they euthanized it in my apartment. You wanna dig it up? For the wolf?
Who are you talking to?
Man, Cheez-its are fucking good.
Amir, relax.
Yo, I could chow down on the D's right now.
Trying to hide from you.
DON'T!
Why do you thinly veil these depressing anecdotes in raps? You're still saying it, you know?
DON'T! I can tell you're gonna rap by the face you're making.
Oh, yo it's like everything you say is still a thing and it holds weight and it's inappropriate for the work place uh, or anywhere really, you should, or you'll never be kicking anyone in the chest.
I don't think birth control comes in a bottle.
Was it really?
Are you okay?
STOP! Do you need to go home?
Hello.
This is MY apartment!
What did I do?
What didn't I do?
I didn't do everything?
No.
What's funny?  Look, what do I have to do for you to let me in?

amir: And it's not sighing loudly into the like EVERYTHING I SAY IRRITATES YOU!!
Fine. I'll sign your facebook wall.
I'll high-five you in front of Pat Cassels.
I'll send you a nice text message, so you can show it to everybody at work.
When you ask me questions at work, like 'how random would it be if we both had red, curly hair?' I'll give you legitimate answers instead of just saying 'I don't know'.
God. So random.
They're going to see what it's about in like a second.
Relax.
He didn't ask.
Then like I said before, right? Relax.
Not funny.
Oh, listen, can I videotape you for one second? My friends back home don't believe you're real.
Yeah.
Hey guys, alright, this is him. This is Amir. Say "Hi", Amir.
He doesn't know that's a joke. Amir, what's 12 plus 28?
It's not.
You didn't know.
What's my great-great-uncle's name on my mom's side?
And what's your middle name?
Final question. And this one should be really good. Um, what's with that tissue in your nose?
So he doesn't even know.
I'm doing the next one.
No signs whatsoever?
No signs or no science?
Don't act like you get it, cause those are both wrong.
What?
Rest...? You guys are cousins?
Wow...
Where?
oh...
Lost you once?
I am so sorry...
Hey, you're watching Jake and-
They can't see you!
Oh my god!
What is wrong with you?
yeah.
No, um, I'm just freaked out about the hand, you know?
You didn't hear about this?
There's a crazed axe murderer...
Yeah, I'm serious...
...He's in an insane asylum and he chopped off his own hand...
...And its missing. They don't know where it is.
Well you don't have to think about it. It's - I mean it's pointless anyway because it's far away  it's never going to-
OH NO!
Oh my god! It's headed for us!  Ahhh!  It's killing me! It's killing me! It's murdering me! It's killing me!  I can't kill it! Ah my go-  ohhh, aw fu...
Hey, hey, hey, hey,  it was my hand. It was my...  No, no! Look!  Hey! Look at my shirt! There's nothing inside my shirt, right?
And - and there's no hand. There's no hand. It was my hand all along.
You're fine, you're fine, you're fine, you're fine, you're fine, you're fine. Come on, you okay? You're fine.  He's fine!
He's fine, He's fine.
He's a big boy. Smile like a big boy!
Smile like a big boy! Huh? You wanna get ice cream?
No, K,  you're fine, you're gonna be okay.  He's fine.
Eh, hahaha!
Yeah
Well, you two actually do look really happy together.
Well, that's good for you.
Yeah
Each of those steps is something I wouldn't do...let alone together.
Huh?

How long have you guys been going out, by the way?
So you rehearsed this, that's good.

Got you.
She left.
Yo bro no go i'm a duhny -

Dropped something.
You don't drop shit, but you dropped your keys.
Let go of my head, right?
What did Ricky say about touching me?
He said never.
So those aren't your keys.
Neh.
Neh.
These aren't yours?
So that's fine.
That's cOO. Okay, that's coo. How are you gonna act like you're too proud for anything when your pants are on backwards right
Unzip your fly?

Were not going to do that.  No-No, no, no, no.
OK, hold on!
Put down the f**king camera and help!

The future is now! Seize the day!
Don't--
Yes.
Much too late actually. But--
Then what it- Then what's in the past, if history is now?
No one- No one wants to use it.
So you guys are here to learn about standing up, and making a change that you believe in. So--
Oh, God. That--
Yes! That's th--
You can't-- You're gonna tell seven hundred and fifty ambitious young teenagers that they can't make a difference?
It's--
You know, there's a Chinese proverb that says the journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step.
You heard it from Amir: we can be better than the Chinese. Is that what you want to say?--
We are- Everybody's equal! That's..--
Alright, everybody, have a really fun and enriching weekend.--
They're n-- How old were you when you kissed a girl?

So you haven't kissed a girl.
There's no time.

Cuz you need to base your opinions off of mine.
Because you don't have any thoughts or opinions of your own.
And you think that stealing mine is--
I don't get why you're being so honest about it.
I hate nuggets.
You're watching Jake and Amir
Out of time
It's my friend Steve from back home ok. His sister just go engaged.
This is so not relevant to you is what it is.
What're you...what're you doing?
You don't ever talk to your parents, man.

Nope
Relax, please -
Ok, so now you're being annoying and disgusting. Just -
Probably not, I mean it just happened, ok?
Cool. So you're done for now then?
No, I donno man.
Not for you. Nothing changes for you, it's all just one way.
She hasn't even gotten married yet, Amir.
You know what then, she's divorced. She got a divorce.
Hey you're watching Jake and Amir.
Shut the fuck up!
whoa get out of my appartment.
That's half right.
So totally wrong.
You were just mean to Pat.
So yes.
I guess why?
I'm depressed that you get it, yet you still wanna do it.
No.
I'm not curious.
Didn't ask a question.
That's like, where you only drink water for a week?
That's what you said.
So you're not gonna drink anything or eat anything for a week?
But I was right about not eating or drinking anything?
Yes.
Yes.
Why?
Sounds like three weeks.
Shut up!
I mean you're not gonna be able to keep that up.
That's Christina Aguilera lyrics
Yeah. I mean you're eating a bag of chips right now.
Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir, and you don't have to be holding my hand.
Oh my God! What are you doing?
Oh my-oh! There he is! Come here, come here!
Did you make a youtube video?
It doesn't. That's not what it depends on at all.
Why is that weird?
Like 100%, man.
It's embarrassing.
You can't; you didn't upload it.
Yeah, yeah, you should put it on Digg.
Embarrassing vi-You try and get as many people as possibly to digg it and that means like, to hide it.
Give it something, like boring, so that less people will want to see it.
And boring.
He doesn't get acronyms.
N-n-n-n-n-no!
...
Put your dick away, man!
My brother is going to be here, any second, and I really--
That's what guessing is. Kumail!
That's because I haven't seen Kumail, in like what, 13 years!
Or talk.
OK, I'm going to go to the bathroom man, and when I get back, we have checking up to do.
Hey Kumail, you ready to roll?
Again?
God, you're stupid man.
Sure, yeah  because, did you know that Amir is the last person on earth?
Yeah, that's the only reason I'd ever ditch dinner with you and have dinner with him.
Later, dude.
Uh, it was good.  It was expensive, but it was good.
You're just repeating what I say.
Uh, it's just that Kumail doesn't have like any money right now so I had to pay.
No. Not right now. But he has like this insanely good business idea which is why I invested my last $5,000 in it, and uh, it's going to make both of us rich.
Yeah, it's called scale.com. You step on your laptop and the site will actually weigh you.
I'm kidding! You think I would tell you the business idea? I don't even know it yet.
It's called trusting someone. Your brother.
My brother.
Shut up, all right? Nevermind.
Why? Because I want to hang out with him more than I want to hang out with you?
Wow.
You've kept me from my own surprise party, you've spied on me in the bathroom, you poisoned my food, but this is a new low.
Yeah, sure. You told me you had 60 beers once.  You said you never drop anything. You said you had some new girlfriend--
NO, YOU SHUT UP! My brother is finally back and I'm happy and he's going to make us both rich and for once I'm not going to let you f**k it up for me.
Frine or fine?
You know what? Maybe I will, because he's in the kitchen right now and we're going to get lunch together, bitch!
You're a bitch.
You're a bitch's bitch.  Nothing?
Hey, Sarah!  Did you meet my brother, Kumail?
Cool.
Absolutely man, where to?
Remember when I was 4 and you were 11 and you stole Robbie McGuiness's bike and you blamed it on me, and his friends beat the s**t out of me?
Forty-eight! You didn't even try to stop them!
Yeah man, why?
Absolutely, I'm going to go to the ATM.
Hallo, mate! 'ere you go, 100 big ones! Forty extra so you don't have to ask again.
Ooo yeah, that's tempting but f**k no. I'm going camping with Kumail this weekend  and I have to go home and pack.
Absolutely, we meet outside the Harlem train station at midnight, with all our gear including the biggest tent imaginable--
And don't take a cab!!
See you then!
My brother is going to be here, any second, and I really--
My brother is finally back and I'm happy and he's going to make us both rich.
I'm going camping with Kumail this weekend  and I have to go home and pack.
It was good. Camping. So.
It wa-it was crazy. It was awesome. We-we hiked, we camped, we talked-we talked for hours. He told me that uh, that I turned out to be a really good person.  That he was happy for me.  That he was proud of me.
And I caught a fish and Kumail said it was the biggest fish ever.  So...
He um, he actually had to take off.  Uh, yeah, he went to go get start on that business plan, so, I can guarantee you that I hear from him very soon.
Absolutely.
I'd be down to go this weekend. Again.
Hey. Thanks.
Ray, a drop of golden--
Still?
Yes. You were insane.
And I found you, with the park ranger, three days later, unconscious in a stream.
It's that program I told you about, the Big Brother program. You know it's a good cause, you should sign up.
If you have the time?
You sign up and they pair you with a kid.
No.
I already said no.
Please don't call them it.
Daily what sessions?
Cool.
That wouldn't work.
You don't have to teach them how to wipe, alright, I think they're like thirteen.
N-no forcing.. anything!
You don't have to pay anything, but that's a terrible attitude anyway.
Penny.
Oh, lemme put in your language: no boy, it ain't kosh!
Well it SHOULD.
Wow
What are you doing?
Is the first tip dressing like a schizophrenic homosexual?
And you memorized them all...
What's tip number forty-two?
And how does it feel?
Tip number eight?
I'm impressed that you know all this, but I wish you wouldn't use the little brain power that you have to memorize girls magazines.
You wanna freak guys out in bed?
Scaring people like boo?
I think this is the most you have ever not gotten it.  And that's saying a lot.
I'm just gonna... I'm gonna ignore you, sorry
Jesus, what are you doing!?
Who are you?
Okay...
Actually, you said we were dead.
You're the one who said I didn't.
Swine flu.
I was right with swine flu.
Why do you think you have it?
Okay, so you might actually have it.
I guess, why did you that?
Yeah, you might die.  And where did you get a pig?
Your cousin had a pig?
You just said he did.
Okay, tell me exactly what happened.
Don't lie to me about anything.
So you lied to me about standing?
You fucked a pig, or you made out with a pig?
The worst-case scenario: You're already dead.
Ooh, or Hell.
OH MY G
Wow, really bad.
Right off the bat, pick that up.
You can't even spell. How were you texting?
Uh, green.
No we're not.
I'll be white.
Thanks. Good compliment.
Alright, no more compliments from you.
Oh, just got a text from Amir. 'Garllln'. Question mark.
That's a piece from Sorry!. And those weren't the lyrics.
Oh, there's a simple rule for that. If it's made of wood, it's a house, and nothing on the table is candy.
I'm familiar with it.
What do you want me to say? The band did great. You are very bad.
Did you hear what... Amir?
Did you hear what I said about your singing? It was very bad? I said it was bad.
The bass.
I said the bass.
You keep calling everyone Bradlin and it's not a name.
It's... weird.
Yes, oh, a girl! Absolutely. Give me like 30 seconds.
I understand.
Okay, write hey. You need a lot of help, I understand. Alright. . Let's do...
I'm watching you, so don't steal anything from me.
Okay.
WHy don't you just say Iy's been really ni-
It's been really nice getting to know you  and I am going to break your fucking neck. Okay? I'm going to break your neck.
Compliment her, say she's got beautiful eyes.
Don't touch my stuff. Okay?
Can you leave me alone? Can you just do me a huge favor and leave me alone for the rest of my life?
This is my cookie..
I'm not eating-
I'll put it- I'll put it- I'm not going to eat it-
Okay, we're going to put it down right here.
Wow wow wow don't!
You want the cookie right?  Is it fucking good?
Yeah?
I'm sorry.
DOn't you dare cut me any slack. Okay? I'm out of line.
Let me help you up.
I'll get you some ice, how's that? WHat hurts?
Don't go. I blew up, I'm gonna go.
Hey you're watching Jake and Amir.
What?
Wow. You're just gonna let him talk to you like that?
So you've never talked to anybody?
You know what I would do if I were you?
I'd march right into Ricky's office, and make him choose.
I didn't finish.
You make him choose: you, or Streeter.
Him choose.
Hey, if he even hesitates, if he's like um I don't really know, I guess you, then f*** him! You wanna work under a guy who's not SURE  who his favorite employee is? No, you don't! You don't deserve that! Do you think you deserve that?
No, you don't deserve that.
You deserve some stuff.
Okay, practice on me.
Streeter.
Ooh, I dunno, I guess, uh--and then you cut me off, cuz you just f***ing quit!
You know what man? F*** Ricky, for even making you ask the question.
March your ass in there and quit!
Hey how'd it go?
Ooogh. I'm sorry to hear that man.
Yeah well I guess I'm really--...What?
Why are you putting your stuff in a box?
No you aren't.
What's wrong?
Oh my god. Is she okay?
Horrible.
Oh my god, you should go home.
Nothing.
You're still covered in lotion.
Hey, Amir? What are you doing?
You're dead?
You're acting like you didn't say you were dead?
You're terrible at being discreet while you are obviously playing a video game.
You do a lot of stuff your vocabulary isn't capable of describing, but that doesn't mean it's not happening.
For instance: you don't know what malnourished means.
But, you eat a diet only of chicken nuggets.
I'll tell you what. I'll take you out to dinner if you just make eye contact with me for 5 seconds.
Five second in a row.
All right. Catch.
Show me your hands.
OK.
Ooo, you messed up.
You know that this is a youtube video right?
So no.
Hey-
No.
Jake.
I'm just standing here-
Stop.
Your like saying this into my neck.
It's working?
Okay first of all you both look like shit today, which is saying a lot because you usually look terrible to begin with. Secondly, where are you guys going to lunch? Because thirdly, we're coming with.
No.
-n with, secondly, were are you guys gonna go to lunch? Because thirdly,  we're coming with.
Yeah.
I don't care, what you do, at all...
Guy walks into a bar, ouch.
Hey!
So...--
...It's nice to see you. That's it.
The movie?
You ditched us when you went to the bathroom for 45 minutes.
Ok you mean this one?
No its not
Ok 10:16 pm, one minute later, NO no no no no no wait 30 seconds I'm leaving right now.
Then I get one from you at 11:45 pm, Just got out of B room. Sorry for the lie sauce. Had to buy some time to finish those sandies. Where you izat?
Just read what I wrote actually.
Ok 1:01 am, lololol are you fucking joking me.
Well, you're talking to me now, so...
Thanks.
Thought you weren't talking to me.
Y'know, I think you're more talkative when you're giving people the silent treatment.
You're talking to me again.
Pat's not here.
I get it. It looks like a banana vagina, go back to your desk.
Wow, don't make that a thing you call me.
You just yelled at me and now you want to ask me to din--
Even if you weren't yelling at me, I have dinner plans already.
Not going to McDonald's, all right? I'm going to another restaurant called Nina's.
No, it's not.
So you've done that?
I'm surprised you think it's a coupon.
Like a temper tantrum?
Not what I said. So, do you do this often?
I guess I just feel bad cashing in these types of coupons.
OK, now I've lost my appetite.
There he is!
I cannot even believe you came into work today, man.
Dude, after last night, bro?
What do you think you did last night?
Do you seriously not remember?
We got drunk last night!
Oh, my god. It's called blacking out, man.
You must've forgotten the entire night!
Shit! I had no idea you could drink that much. Did you know you could drink that much?
Try three bottles of vodka!
I know you can because you had some fucking gin right afterwards!
Yeah, they called you the gin guzzler, yo.
The gin guzzler. You were dancing. You were out on the dance floor. You were all being fucking weird. You were shaking your shit around.
Yeah, everyone thought you looked like an asshole!
Except for one girl.
Who is kind of into it. She walks on over and she's all swaggin' it and you got your confidence all turned on--
--and you grab her by the waist and--
Her by the waist!
All right, not me. And you were like 'Hey, babe.' you kissed her right on the mouth.
That's what I'm talking about. And then she fucking PUKED!
All over you, it was crazy! How do you not remember this?
You were fucking cussing her out. You were all pissed about it--
--bouncer, he comes over and he's like 'Hey, you yelling at this girl?'--
--and then her boyfriend came over--
Then, he flails you up against the wall--
--and he's like 'I'm going to kick your ass' and you're fucking pleading with your eyes--
--please don't take my life, please don't take my life. You're begging him with your eyes and he- You're freakin' peeing your pants. You're pissing your pants. He felt bad for you and he just tossed you out on the curb.
You crawled back in and you were like 'Aw, fuck, please Jake, I need to get home--
--let me borrow ten bucks to get home. Please, please, please.' Then I lent you ten bucks and I want that back now and I won't tell anybody about what happened last night.
Deal.  Hey, Rosie, movie is on me!  I feel bad.  Let me get another twenty, I don't want to make him walk. We're going to take a cab. We're going to cab it.
We're going to cab it.
No time to spell my name.
Then you were wrong.
Hey dude!
Yeah what's up? What are you doing?
Sure sure, that's cool. Hey uh, quick question:  where the fuck is my stuff?
You were not wearing those a second ago.
My desk is empty, alright? Everything is gone.

amir: Have you ever heard of eBay?
Yes.
I said I heard of it. Did you sell my stuff on eBay?
How much would that be?
You know, never mind. If you didn't sell my stuff, where is it?
Okay, so earlier when you said you didn't sell my stuff on eBay...
Yeah, it was a steal. You stole it from me.
I guess it's not an argument if you're just admitting everything.
Okay, it's still not, I don't have any stuff!
Almost sounds logical, but right off the bat I have no damn computer to turn on.
Fine, I'll get some water.
Okay... What?
You can't just come over here and be like 'So then I'll all like everybody get on the floor'. You can't just start stories in the middle, that's not how that works. What the hell is on your chest?
Looks like you wrote something on your chest.
It's pretty possible.
Just take it off your shirt.
All right. You don't have to take off your shirt, but now I'm--
Wow, I haven't even fake bribed you yet.
I don't think I get it. I don't-I don't get what you're trying to do.
It's not even polite.
OK, that's not what that says.
Didn't you at least double check in a mirror?
I mean, there's a f***ing arrow.
Then you didn't know. You either knew, or you thought it was a letter.
OK, I know. Look, even if by some small miracle everybody in this office gave a s**t that it was your half birthday and they wanted to clap for you so loudly that you could even *ask* them to stop, if you needed to display a message on your chest, wouldn't you feel weird about admitting that you knew all of this all along?
All right.
Hi, you're watching Jake and Amir.
Thanks.
You rented Kate  Leopold?
It's all the same one bad movie, and I'm not coming over.
Did you say you were gonna try to hurt yourself?
Okay.
Great.
Are you rapping or are you asking me a question?
This morning, right before work.
Aaah.
Don't do the stupid laugh, just say whatever you wanna say.
And don't rap.
Alright, I'll put it in your language.  I listened to your story now you listen to mine.
I don't wanna wear that same s**t as you do all the time
No I don't.  And I know I can text you the night before
But I don't wanna get into the weird things you want me to do anymore.
So leave me alone for the rest of the day, now that would be fantastic, that would be
Oh.
Great.
That's not agreeing to disagree.
I know it's easy.  It's not about the degree of difficulty.
That's not true.
Okay.  We're done.
We're done.
Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir.
No no no no.
Oh god, no no!
Alright. Do you know why you're here?
Okay.
You crying?
I'm gonna give you a blindfolded taste test, see if you like some new food, and hopefully we can expand your diet.
Here we go.
How is it?
That's a pineapple.
Alright, this is kinda like a chicken nugget: grilled chicken.
Man.
Oh!
It's water!
That's impossible.
Don't be sad, it's fine. It's fine.
You're not tied up.
It's probably your diet.
Fine.
You're not even gonna try to be discreet, huh?
You're blindfolded.
Try opening your eyes.
What did you do?
So you forgot why we're here in the first place.
Ready, here you go.
That one good?
You like that one?
That's a good one. You like it a lot
Put it in your mouth, all the way.
Put it in your mouth all the way and eat it. You're not chewing it. You're not chewing it. You're not doing anything.
Chicken nugget. Do you think I was gonna feed this to you accidentally?
Alright, well, here we go.
You like that?
That's cauliflower, man. Amir?
You're watching Jake and Amir.
Wasn't gonna bring it up.
It's fine, it's going fine.
Nope.
Yep, and stop calling me kid, I know.
Right. I don't have anything to tell you.
Sure. Nothing to tell you this --
You're yelling about it right now.
Okay, you know what? I know you've been checking my email, so I wrote a fake email from a fake doctor just to fuck with you, that's what happened.
Yeah. Well I also put that in there.
Right, yeah, that's part of me f**king with you.
Oh, snap, good one man. How were you messing with me by the way?
How were you messing with me?
Okay, that's what I thought. I was just making sure.
Yes, yes it was...
HAHAHAHA NO, NO, SHUT UP AHAHA STOP MAN HAAHA.
Yeah...
NO, NO, NO!
Watching
No.
Oh whoa If it's something normal like that then I'm actually happy to help what's up.
So you wanna kinda like take.
Oh my god.
That's terrible.
You saw, what did you do?
Jennah? Or Jenny?
Oh okay.
Lieutenant Dan.
What is wrong with you! You know I believed you, you can't...
That's seriously messed up.
Okay I think I'm just going to go.
It's the wrong character.
Wrong movie.
Really, really bad.
Just.. come on.
Come one, wake up.
You have an apartment right?
I do, I'm not sleeping in the office.
Where's your apartment?
Third? So you're not living here. You address.. what is it?
Okay.
Something you can do at your apartment if you had one.
Don't touch me.
Yeah. Go. Go brush your teeth, man. Pound it. Peace out.
Peace out.. alright.
It's my email. You're good right?
You don't have to touch my shoulder anymore.
It's fine.
I don't want to be touched.
Nothing's wrong with me.
Hey man, wake up.
The entire night, I think.
Alright, you're good.
They probably have an idea.
Are you even trying to do magic? The middle cup.
Oh, wow... That's impressive! I have to go back to work now; I have to do actual work 'cause we have real jobs. Do it one more time.
Okay, I get it now. Pretty simple, man. Right cup.
Wow, congratulations! The world's first retarded musician!
Okay, I said magician, buttfuck; just do it again.
Wow, I thought so too, but I'm a little bit smarter than you. Right cup.
Okay...
Do it again.
Okay, well, I know it's not in th DAMN IT! COME ON! ...My fault, my fault. Do it again.
That one right there.
Middle.
...No, FUCK IT, I was guessing.
So then the trick is that there are these slits in the back of the cup. And you had to figure it out, it's pretty tough, but I did it. Kiss for the magician?
What is that noise?
Doesn't look like you're reading a book.
It's a Kindle.
I cannot imagine a product that would be of less use to you.
Why do you think it's great?
Nothing.
Are you even listening when it reads to you?
What's muss?
What books have you read so far?
What were they about?
Reading isn't about bragging rights.
You stole it from Pat?
You never spent any time reading.
Books. OK, yeah, let's talk about books.
I mean you're the one who--
Okay, we just need to plan this intern appreciation surprise party.
Ugh, what the hell are you doing!
I'm not you're boyfriend.
Okay, so you're justifying it or you misspoke? Which one?
They wouldn't crack up.
No.
This isn't your phone.
What's up.
Cool. Just about done there?
I've never seen you wash your hands before.
Are you stuck?
You constantly are following me around, you always want me near you, and now you want me to leave.
Alright, fine, I'm gonna go, man; I'm gonna go to McDonald's. You wanna go to the Dees? Wanna come?
Check this out: nuggets.  I'll leave them right there for you. Good?
Ok, so you, you're not stuck, but yet you can't--
My phone?! What are you doing with my phone?!
You were checking my voi- I'm not gonna relax, why were you checking my voicemail?!
Ok you want me to start pretending that that's the norm? You're running the water! Why would you be running the water?!
Ok, you're acting like this is my fault!
Wanna go to the hospital?
Yeah.
I'm not sure, I saw him before, but I don't know.
Yo.
What are you doing in Ricky's office?
How many hours?
So you're afraid of the storm?
No?
Yes.
You're right.
You OK?
OK, you're lying down though.
Yeah.
OK, I'll do that.
Sure.
What?
OK, so you want me to stay?
OK, what if I don't want to stay?
And why would you tell her it's from you?
OK, she wouldn't believe you.
Yeah, we will see, I guess we'll just see. I'll stay.
It is counter-clockwise.
And I'm telling you that I don't want you sleeping over at my house anymore.
I didn't give you keys to my apartment.
Why should I have to change my locks all the time?
That would awesome. Thank you. Don't--
Sorry.
No.
Come on.
That sounds pretty cool.
Umm, I don't know.  I'm not sure if Vegas is really for me, it's a little crazy.
You know what? It might be fun. I'll go.
I thought you were going to pass?
Go.
Go, man. I'm going to stay here, you go--
--have fun.
I'm going to hold down the fort, you know? You go--
We are not going to be the fort holders. Tell you what. I'm going to write down my answer on a piece of paper.
You're going to do the same thing.  We're going to give it to Ricky.
Privately.
And then, we each - we each do our own.
Stop quoting Swingers at me.
No.
Hey, we're Jake and Amir, and we want you to come to the Vimeo Meet-Up--
No no NO, no.
We just want you to come to the Vimeo Meet-Up--
Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir.
You're not a robot.
Blackjack is simple.
Okay, that's actually racist.
Right. The important thing to remember is that Jacks, Queens, and Kings are all worth ten.
Ten.
It's - okay.
You have fifteen with the dealer showing ten. That would mean you want to hit.
Not me.
I'm sorry.
Okay
Okay, you have a ten and a seven. How much is that worth?
No, seventeen.
Would still be wrong.
What?
How many cards are dealt?
No.
That's a basic strategy.
They're all my cards. You made me pick every card.
Yes.
That's the seven of diamonds.
You're a seven of diamonds?
You know I don't have to teach you anymore if you don't want.
You know what? Let's play this instead.  If it's red, say fire. If it's black, say smoke.
Come on, it's funny.
Amir, are you there? I'm really sorry.
Yeah, I'm here.
Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir!

Yeah, your back is bleeding.
Okay.
You're okay.
You're okay.
You're okay.
Oh...
You're watching Jake and Amir.
What?
Uh...no, thank you.
Oh, alright.
My bad.
You talking to me?  I can't go.
My bad.  Go ahead. Sorry.
I can hear what you're saying.
Sorry, you just keep on...never mind.
Sorry, my bad.
I didn't say any-
I didn't say -
Will you stop quoting Austin Pow-
Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir
No...
I'm pumped up, does my chest look big?
Is it big?
Alright, ready?
Hey Real World, my name is Jake Hurwitz AKA J-Witz, I love partying, I hate clubbers, punks, bitches, and drama. I'm just a twenty four year old dude from Manhattan, tryin' to make a life, by myself, and uh, whatever
That was a really good take,we should probably...
Yeah
That's Amir he does that a lot.
No, do you want to help him?
He has a knife...
Since I met him three years ago, probably long before that.
He looks okay, he found some oatmeal, let's just roll, I have to, I have to do push ups again.
I watched you pick it out of the garbage can, you didn't make it.
Hey Real World I'm..
Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir.
That's so dated.
Hey I'm Jake Hurwitz, welcome to BFF, the game show that finds out -
Colleen. What does Alex make when she really needs a comfort food?
Hey, hey, you can't be here, alright? You have to go. You have to go back to work now.
Relax, it's fine.
Makeup.
I don't want a latte.
Okay, you did.
Yeah, I'm trying to do some work on my own, so...
Look I'm really behind on some stuff and I just want to get it done without you distracting me. I'm sorry.
Peace.
You're still pulling-
You're still pulling on the door.
Okay, I don't want you to come inside.
Okay, how's this? I'll just come outside when I'm done. Okay?
Latah.
Peace.
Did you leave?
Then how can you hear me? And how come I can still see you?
That sounds like a great reason not to come in this room.
Good call.
Air-five, right there.
Alright, peace.
Later.
Alright.
Peace out robot.
Bye.
What's up?
You fell.
Okay. Do you want to come in? You can come in if you want.
Okay, fine.
Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir
What?
That was smart. Even though you kinda went off into sentence fragments at the end there and made no coherent point, I think you're smart because you used big words. And then when you finished, you raised your eyebrows at me, which really solidified the point that you knew exactly what you were talking about.
Wow. It sounded a lot like you were reading from Wikipedia, but I know for a fact that you couldn't have been because you were raising your eyes to look at me every few seconds to prove that you were speaking your own original thoughts.
You mean absolutely.
Oh, ok. At first I thought you misspoke, but the way you spun it around on me, and me realize that I was wrong, makes you look smart, and me look stupider by comparison. . Especially because I didn't even know Franish was a language, but I know that it must be, because you said it with such conviction and confidence. Even now as I talk, you're just nodding your head, which makes me realize that you knew you were right all along--
That was a tight rap.  Normally raps have to rhyme, but you delivered it in such a way that made you seem like a professional freestyler. You know, even when you seemingly couldn't think of the next word you kind of just went aaah and shook your head, which made me realize that you were purposefully done talking. As a result, I'm your good friend now and I want to hang out more, take you to McDonald's and just generally hang you with you as much as possible.
Now you're raising the roof, which I thought was outdated, but I know that it can't be outdated because you're doing it. I've grown to respect you so much in the last few minutes. I'm realizing you're not getting my sarcasm, even though I'm laying it on very thick.
Now you're squinting and nodding because you know you should be comprehending something, but you're still not.
And now you're smiling because you think that I think that you understand--
Not our intro.
Okay, you wanna see something impressive.   Who's Ricky?
What name?
Yes     AMIR: No
Yup     AMIR: No
Yes     AMIR: No
No     AMIR: Yes
We use all those sites.
Ok, he's not talking about sex.
And we don't do that.
Those all kinda sound like the same thing.
Wasn't crush it the second thing?
Then the third thing was...?
Comprende?
Well, maybe.
You have always said that, yeah.
How is that gonna help traffic?
So you're saying, it's a good idea for the site if me and Amir go to your favorite clothing store -
and uh, we get just matching pajamas.
I am, I think I'm really getting it. Ricky didn't hire you.  Amir hired it.
No, he's under the table.
Right there.
You're waving him down.
Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir.
Declare what?
Who?
That's Hilary.
She's a producer, OK? So part of her job is to talk on the phone. Just relax.
What's that?
Stop saying worms?
What is the matter with you?
Every single day, for the last two years-
Don't do that.
I said don't do that before I thought you might hit her.
Look if you absolutely have to you can go other there and calmly, kindly ask her to please talk quietly.
Amir.  Eyes.
Gimme your eyes. I trust you.
Hey you're watching Jake and Ami-
Oh! I'm bleeding
Hey! Do you mind explaining this?
That's what this is?
Okay cool. Um, you can actually just say Thai restaurant, you don't have to say Thai food restaurant it accomplishes the exact same thing
Peace out!
Because I thought what this was was a complete comprehensive list of every single outfit I've ever worn since I started working here
No?
Do you mind if I refer to the first page here?
Because here...  The first 'item' on your menu isn't like pad Thai or spring rolls it's December 3rd Jake is wearing blue jeans, yellow belt, grey hoodie and white shoes. With a smiley face, so
This is seriously fucking disturbing Amir! I know you're a weirdo. I get that! You're stupid, you're a moron, you're creepy, you're freakishly obsessed with me but this crosses the line. It's seriously fucked, it is. It's
No I'm gonna get rid of it
That was good.
Alright, one, two, three
One two three lift!
Okay? One two three
I specifically didn't say that because I knew it would confuse you.
Why don't you just get off.
You're still on.
That's actually a pretty good idea.
You're not even near the dresser.
So you're done helping?
You're the one that said this needed to be out of here by 5 PM if we wanted to throw it away.
Fine. Put the guitar down.
Now.
Down.
Are you gay, man?
I justI gotta ask.
You said you could benchpress it.
You're the one that asked me to help you.
Not throwing anything in your face
It's not helping!
Yyes!
I leave for a second, you try to benchpress it again.
Uh no, it just started.
Yeah, wow.
What are you?
Come on!
Swallow it first at least.
No.
Bad sound effects.
So no computer today huh?
Well, at least it's refreshingly honest.
What?
That's nice. Alright, thank you.
No.
Why is tha-what?
I don't speak Hebrew.
I don't...I don't get it.
It doesn't mean anything to me.
I mean c'mon. It's not that silly.
Okay. I don't get what you're saying, but you're tone is getting kind of creepy so-
Yes Amir, my shirt is grey.
Okay. I'm gonna get back to work okay?
YES, Amir.
I...I don't know. What did you just say?
You were just talking for such a long time I fee...Y'kn-No, yes, the answer Amir, is
Sorry! Are you meaning to be speaking in Hebrew right now?
Got it.
I said I got it.
What are you doing, bozo?
Oh bozo? You're a dweeb.
Hey, have you been to the kitchen today?
Oh, well you should go in and check out the fridge.
Well you don't have to be hungry to go and look at the fridge!
You shall!
Ok, no, look! Amir! What are you doing?
Get off the ledge! Your going to hurt yourself
Bo-Peep, but whatever! Please get off the ledge, your scaring us!
No one- No one here is going to think of you like that, right guys?
Look man! I was teasing you as a friend! I was teasing you!
Yeah, a friend.
Well, as a friend, yeah...HEY HEY HEY, as a BEST FRIEND! A best friend!
You don't really sound like him
Hey, hey, hey, you don't have to tell me anything you might be embarrassed about.
Hey, hey, get your hand out of Sarah's bag OK? She is right there.
Stay out of Sarah's bag
Put that away. Put that away. Put that away.
Amir don't.  Do you know what that is? Do you know what it is?
Sarah! Hey, Sarah.
Wow, are you ok?
Good, so you're not choking or anything?
Hahahahahaha, so you don't need the Heimlich?
Nope. I don't.
Alright, peace out.
Sugar-
God, that was close.
That's not true.
Hey, you're watching Jake
Yep, that just turned into an outtake.
How early?
Wow, that's really...
Yeah. Of course!
And you will?
And you will?
You said and.
I don't have any change on me.
We'll pay you later!
We'll pay you later!
So don't freak out, we'll pay you later.
No. I have, like, a twenty dollar bill right now and that's it, so I can't give you twenty cents.
Peace.
Yeah.
He doesn't haveyou don't have to give him a dollar. You don't need a dollar. You payed for one bag, right? Two came out, you ate
You peed on the server and our internet is down.
Yes, in that order.
I'm doing a crossword puzzle...
Ugh, Oxford or pup, four letters.
Not multiple choice and you're wrong. Okay here's an easy one, three letters what does a lamb say? Not hard man.
What does a lamb say?
Three letters.
One
Just letters.
Kay, right off the bat number one across isn't five swastikas.
Mostly because there's supposed to be four letters...
So yeah it's racist
No it's Racist
Racist
Racist.
Can you please go back to your desk.
Okay here's the clue, writing system for the blind.
No, obviously not
I'm saying it's a writing system, not a riding system.
Let's try braille
Go.
Ow Amir, Ow Amir, you're hurting me.
Wow, that's impressive. Looks like you typed it.
It has no, no clues at all.
Awesome dude, and it says Fridays solution right up top
33 down, cobra or boa, blank, blank A, K, E. First letter's gonna be an 'S' so sa, e.
S, suh, say what, sa..
Hey, you're watching Jake and Ami -- are you still crying?
Wow, you are.
What?
You made me a pie?
Is this why you weren't at work all... Go sit down, you're an idiot. You're a moron. Thanks anyways.
You're what?
You still haven't used any words.
Get it out, come on.
Are you deflating?
If you're about to cry, which it looks like you are, I'm sorry I called you an idiot, alright?. You just baked or bought me a pie for seemingly no reason and I thought it was as stupid thing to do. You don't need to tick like that, if you have to cry, just let it out. Don't hold it back.
You're fine. So I can say that you're the worst laser tag player ever.
And you got good grades like a nerd in high school.
Oh my god, do you see that pillar of smoke behind you? A McDonald's is burning down!
How about this. Just say a sentence. If you're going to cry, say 'Jake, I'm not going to cry.'
Hey, you're watching Jake and A-
K, no one will be able to know.
Stop!  What is going on?  Why are you here?
Yes, I have, which is why I asked WHY she was here.
You're still not answering my question.
Pretty sure Leron runs a laser tag.
No.
God, Amir, you cannot just lie to people to get them to do stuff for you.
I specifically said cannot so you wouldn't be confused.
It should, okay.  Julia, I'm really sorry, but Amir lied to you.
Amir, she can understood you when you sing.  It's not like spelling things in front of a  toddler, or you.
Julia, I'm really sorry.  I'm sure it cost a lot of money to get down to New York.  Amir is going to pay you back.
Just go home, man.
Just go home.
Hey, yo dis be Jake.
Wow, I did what you asked and you still messed it up right?
Okay that's fine.
You're a weirdo. What are you doing?
I didn't ask what you're doing today.
You know what, everybody here is laughing at you, not with you.
I'm not jealous.
Hey Amir, you're the biggest loser in the whole office.
Bitch.
Hey everybody. We just wanted to say thank you and tell you how awesome it is that we got to 50,000 Facebook fans.
I know what- I know what you were saying. We can quantify it.
Do you know how to stop it?
mumbles
It's just 'cause your cursor is far above it.
I got it.
OH GOD, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WHAT ARE YOU DOING? DON'T KILL ME PLEASE!
Oh god, I so don't want to die.
Just put the puppet down.
NOT ON THE FUCKING BED!
It's just, it's puppets, I just, it's just...
It's fine, I just have a fear of puppets, that's all.
Yeah... um, look just please don't tell anyone at work.
What?
How did you get that from what she said?
OK, we're driving the Ford Fiesta around the country, we're going to tweet clues about what different cities we're in, and the first two people to find us, we're going to take them out to dinner.
Pretty simple.
She- Yeah, she is.
She's got the keys.
No it's not, it's fine.
What are you doing? What are you doing?!
No! No, no, no, no.
Oh god. No. Amir.
No, I don't.
I said I don't.
Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir.
Shut up.  Really?
I'm here to buy a guitar. You're here because you follow me, everywhere.
So you're just glossing over the fact that I called you out on following me--
Electric?
I know you're not playing.
Ah, nah, I couldn't do that--
Well, not 'cause I don't have the talent, 'cause I don't have the time--
No, I have the talent. So is that talent--  I-- . I--
No, no that's what you're doing? No!
So you actually knocked over a display case--
You already have a job.
Hey, screw it, man. Get an application--
Just in case, just-- get him an application, I'll fill it out, right now.
Yeah--
I'm not gonna buy them for you.
I don't want the guitar.
Yeah, nothing in here. You sure you put a bag in when we left the office?
Yeah, what are you going to do for clothes?
Enough for me.
What about brushing your teeth?
Six hours.
You're not wearing my clothes.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You got it!
Uh--
--four.
All right you guys, let eat!
You didn't get your food yet.
It's fine, you can eat.
It's fine, you can take a bite.
Chill out!
And no- No clue. No words?
Oh look, we found somebody.
Hey--
--Come here.
Yeah.
I'll have the turkey burger.
Since what?
It's been like, ten seconds.
Don't say it, don't say it.
Who did you hear--
No. They've all said no.
Don't say anything!
Worst case scenario, they get kicked out.
Yeah, I know it's terrible for the Fiesta. I know.
You sent him on a road trip with me--
--do you-do you know what it's like tonight? It took three people to get him out of the restaurant, OK? He's unnaturally strong.
--now he's here in the hotel doing some kind of weird confessional thing.
Listen to him.
I have to go to the other room?
I have to go apologize to Sam, I have to call the restaurant because--
You have everything you need. Don't talk-
No more sponsorships.
Yo Amir, you sign up for health insurance? This email says we're supposed to re-enroll.
Yeah you look pretty sick. Your very gaunt.
Well you were checking my email before.
You need to sign up for health insurance. Do you want me to help you?
Ok. Y- So you're not even polite about being dumb, right? S- You know health insurance is a good idea.
It's actually if you don't plan on being sick.
Nobody plans on being sick. You get health insurance just in case.
Do you even know what that expression means?
Ok, look. Amir? You especially need health insurance. You're incredibly malnourished.
Yes it is.
Are you signing up yet?
Why? What do you have to think about?
It sounds like you are already really really sick and you should probably get health insurance.
You just sneezed blood; are you sure you're okay?
Yeah.
It's look- Just, can we just enjoy the view?
We don't have to talk. Just-just enjoy the view and then we get back on the road, OK? We have a long night of driving.
Just enjoy the view. No talking.
Just silence.
Shhhh.
Shh.
Come on.
Just please be quiet.
Shh!
OH!
At the statue? Just don't even say where it is.
We are here. We're at this-We're standing at this guy.
It's actually freezing here, you guys.  You can't tell, but it's like-it's negative twenty-two.
That's so crazy!
So what year are you guys?
Cool, and you guys are uh, sorry.  You're really not going to eat with us, huh?
Why are we in a fight?
Didn't you want to eat here in the dining hall?
And we're here.
It's funny- you just come here and sit next to me then?
What?
Can you please just..--
What the f**k!
This was my idea.
It was our idea.
Here comes somebody running!
Yeah!
Hey.
What's your name?
Jake, nice to meet you.
You guys found us! You b-- You're first!
Everybody, if you just got here, you should be eating pizza! Cuz we have a lot of pizza. And I don't know why you're not eating pizza.
Are you making them pay for the pizza?
You're not?
Is he making you pay for the pizza?
You lie to me constantly. Why would I- Why would I believe you?
Not a game.
I don't wanna--
I'm fine.
We just write random, weird things on our friend's wall as each other. So, like, um, here, come here.
Oh! My god.
All right. Log in as you.
It's not that impressive. OK, now I can sen-- You're only friends with me and Leron?
You decided against it or everyone rejected you?
I'm just going to sign Leron's wall 'hey dude, I french kissed your dog'.
Well, that's the idea, right? You signed up to play the game, there are no vetoes, all right, that's the beauty of it.
I change it literally every day.
No, no, no. No Jaime, not Jaime, not Jaime.
Veto. Veto.
I didn't say that. I didn't say that.
Are you recording me all the time?
OK, look, just not Jaime. All right? She was my first love, my first kiss, my first everything.
Oh shit. Get the-- What the--
No!
Ugh! Oh god, are you OK?
This isn't an icebreaker.
Ok, is this good to send or not?
This is a really important e-mail, Ok, Jamie's single now, and I might have an opportunity.
To f- date her, to date her.  Hey, Sarah. To date her.
Just read the e-mail, Ok, come on.
Wow. I guess it's my fault for asking the least romantic person in the office to help me with an e-mail.  Just delete the first sentence, then
If it's cliche, delete it, she might think it's cliche too.
Oh my God, literary Shakespeare. Right? Congratulations, Sherlock Holme, you cracked another mystery.
Oh, way to go.  Delete the, delete the second one then, or the first one, whichever you think- whichever you think is better.
Oh my God, you're wrong there. Sorry friend, it does.
Oh my God, spell check knows all the answers, right?
Congratulations. Give it up for Amir Blumenfeld, you guys, winner of the fourth grade spelling bee, right?  Oh, congratulations, big boy! Good job, you won the fourth grade spelling bee.
Get rid of the second L! Get rid of it. God, I don't even know why I asked you to do this.
No, no, don't be a big baby about it. Just, overall, what did you think? Not that I respect your opinion.
Wow, two part question for Amir. When's the last time you got laid, brother? And, uh, number two,  delete the second paragraph.
Delete- First part was the laid, they were both- Just delete the second paragraph. Alright? It's not hard.
That's a great idea!
Great idea, that's why you're crawling with women, right? You know what?  Pat! Can you- Can you read this?
It's fine.
Jamie. I'm going to be very very late. NoI'm sorry. It's beyond my control, okay. There was an accident, andlook, justplease,
Hey, dude.
God, I tell you to stop doing that so often.
And that. Okay, looklong story short, I had this major thing for a girl back in high school, and uh, I just found out she's an
Okay no, I just want you to relay this message to Pat. Amir broke his phone earlier.
Don't self-destruct anything, justgive the message to Pat okay, Amir's calling me, one second.
Hey.
Not going anywhere, I'm at the dentist.
Brain busters.
Look, I'm working from home for the next two days.
Leave me alone for two days. Hang out with someone else for two days. Can you handle that? I'll be back.
Good work, don't call me Jakey. I'm gonna go.
Sam.
Okay. I'm gonna go. Just do me a big favor man and don't tell Amir any of this.
Okay. Keep up the good work then.
It's close.
Hey! Uh, Jamie. It's Jake. Uh look, I'm down in Miami for work, um... down here like on a job
Nosorry that wasn't me. Though I wouldn't turn one down. No, Iwell, I mean, I wouldn't turn one down, but I would only accept
Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir.
That's Hawaii.
Hey, Jamie! What's up? Yeah, um, I'm in Miami for work. So I have, like, meetings now, but maybe we could, uh, hang out after.
I'm on 17th and Collins.
Oh my god. Hey psychos. What are you doing here?
That's not a pet name.
How the hell did you guys get here, and what is thisyou guys are in the Bang Bus.
It's a porn site. They get strangers to fuck in a van.
Is she fucking somebody?
Hey, I'm sorry. Um, what was that address again? I think I just found a ride.
I had this major thing for this girl from my high school, I just found out she's here in Miami.
You guys are in the Bangbus.  I think I just found a ride.
Just let the video start.
You know you guys don't have to sit back there .
A few minutes ago you didn't even know what it was.
Great high five.
Ok lets just concentrate on getting to Jamie's house.
Oh that's us, take a left.
Jamie, I'm going to be very, very late.
No, I'm sorry.  It's beyond my control, ok, there's been a accident and...
Please I'm sorry just go to your audition and I'll meetup with you after.
This is beyond my control, okay? There is an accident and...
Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir and Jake's not gonna stay mad at me if I tickle him!
Ow!
So this is Bang Bros headquarters.
Sticky isn't a smell, put this down.
Just keep your heads down. Look apologetic.
Like the cracker?
Did you say about... murder?
Ah! You know where we spent this?  It's purple and purple
Well, plaid with polka dots, so that's a no. Also, you're an asshole.
You gonna pick them up?
In your own chair, right?
Um, we don't have a van.
No, no. We're not really comfortable filming anything with you guys, so...
We're looking at the forms.
No. No. No.
Alright, here's the plan. I think we can slip out of here at some point.
Why are you taking off your clothes?
Jamie!
What are you doing here?  I thought you had an audition!
Jamie?
What are you doing here, I though you had an audition?
This is the last one.
Gosh this is so F**ked
Nothing to hug out.
No I'm not hugging you.
Sam here's the plan.  Do you remember the time you got out of that community service day by faking the seizure?
exactly, do that.  Me and Amir will sneak out the back and met you in the hospital and we'll bust you out from there.
Ok no we're doing this to avoid doing the porno.
Jamie you don't have to be doing this.
I'm only doing this because we have no money, because we crashed a van.  Which I know sounds worse but... But you can have a better life than this.
yeah, forty thousand dollars a year is like in the grand scheme of this...
What?  Four hundred thousand?  Ok, yeah.  Jamie I love you, I've always loved you.  I couldn't stop thinking about you in high school.  I can't stop thinking about you now.  All I want to do is be with you and if you maybe feel the same way my naked friend over there  is going to fake a seizure and we're going to bust him out of a hospital.  Now I know that sounds cliche but you have two options.  You can come with me to New York and live happy ever after, or you can stay down here in Miami making porn.  Either way just know I've always, always loved you.
I can't believe you stayed in Miami and had sex with Jamie .
Same video, though.
Is this the jacket I was looking at yesterday?
No, no, no.  Get back to the desk, back to the desk.
Wow.  Thank you.
What?
I think you mean the hardest part about rollerblading.
The joke is What's the hardest part about rollerblading? Telling your dad that you're gay.
Hey, I'm not gonna pay you back for this jacket.
Earlier, you said something about me paying you back for the jacket and I wanted you to know that I'm not gonna pay you back.
I know, that's true. I also don't ever have to pay you back.
Okay, I don't wanna owe you any favors either.
I didn't buy the jacket because it was too expensive which means I don't wanna gradually pay you back in any way.
You'er basically saying exactly what I don't want to do, and you're making it a little worse by adding extra stuff on top of it.
Just take the jacket back.
Well why don't you return it and you can take the money?
The security tag is still in this.
Which means you stole it.
First- first whats?
Dinners? You said dates.
Anybody heard- Who heard him say dates?
That's one.
No time to spell my name.
Then you were wrong.
Don't tell me, from now on, ok?
Wow. Blumenfeld, you kidding me with that?
There's.. a little bit of space.
I can see it from here, there's like a foot of spa--
It was like that? You just practically broke it. Look-- it's fine. I was kidding. Relax.
It's fucking fire hazard?--
Ok so you care about fire hazard all of a sudden. You've covered my desk with lit candles before.
Ok, didn't think it was until now. Why don't you just learn to laugh at yourself? People will respect you more for that.
That's not.. exactly what I meant.
...Not saying that.
Didn't say it.
That's fine.
No one saw you do it.
What do you do, you laugh it off. Clumsy me!
There you go
Clumsy you.
Alright. Go to the bathroom.
Thought you said you were gonna do this one.
You know when you're an adult it's actually not cool to not love your mom.
Okay, yeah, that's always awkward. Who is it?
Which one?
Ah, which one is it though. Your mom's sister's daughter or your mom's sister's daughter's friend.
One of those people is your cousin the other would be a family friend.
You're telling me it's uncomfortable calling somebody, I'm telling you it's weird to f**k your cousin.
Yes.
So you know that?
In this scenario which one of those two people is your cousin?
That wasn't even an option.
I didn't sa-
Nice.
See, that was good.
Wow.
Whoah, you got it!
That is really sweet.
No way, in 1080?
How much did that cost you, if you don't mind me asking?
So what's the standard lens that it comes with?
OW! God! What is wrong with you? Am I bleeding?
Really? Come on, I'm gonna wash this off, man.
Hey you're watching Jake and
I can not believe I let you do that.
Oh!
Sorry!
Knock- what? What are you talking about?
- I know what knocking is, this isn't a single bathroom.
THIS isn't, THIS is not a single bathroom.
Right?
Okay, do you know what impasse means?
You could be. Okay shut the door.
No!
NO! What is wrong with you?
It's not what it looks like.
Urgh! Oh! Oh!
Geez, thank God, what are you, what, what are you doing?!
No no no, it's pudding.
No one will believe that.
What?
Yea, sure. What's up?
Whats up guys?
Sure thing. On his lap or...
... next to him?
You good?
I guess not, no.
Oh man.
Oh my goodness
You're so strong.
Look at this guy.
Yes, you're right. Amir brings his computer to work everyday.
Pride and Prejudice? Hahaha.
Let's watch this tonight, man.
Dammit man.
No
You're actually watching Jake and Amir.
No.
I know.
Ow! Come on.
What?
Not really.
On your lap?
You look familiar.
Yes, he does. You were Amir's dating coach. You tried to steal money from him as a dating coach.
What the f...
Salad.
Salad.
Wow. Neither is  four, five, six  really if you think about it. Right?
Wrong.
You're singing differenet songs, different songs. You're singing crossroads.
Amir never brings a computer to work.
Never.
Yeah.
What's my favorite movie?
I didn't know that was a movie.
If you want to be friends with me, just give me some space. Don't annoy me by pullig me into...
Thank you.
Get off me, goddammit, man.
Ew, ew, ew.
You just bit me.
Bad pun.
What?
Not much, dude. I was just walking back to my desk and you started freaking out and calling my name. Pretty much nonstop
Oh that's kinda cute, it's a letter to Santa. Who are you writing it for? You? Okay, now it's just sad.
The whole thing is really really aggressive.
Read back the first sentence.
Right, yeah. This is bad. I hate when you, like, don't get something, but you're also angry about it. It just feels, like,
I'm sitting.
Sure, yeah. So you believe in Santa.
Trust me, it's the issue.
You know you're Jewish, right?
So you forgot your own name?
It'll get easier.
Well it's water.
Actually it does.
Ok I can see what you're doing.
Alright, you know what, never mind; I'm too tired for this today, man.
No.
AEH! What's aeh?--
What is aeh!?
Finish your-- finish your sentences!
That's a really really dumb idea.
Everybody notices.
You know sometimes you're down there for like three hours!
It seems like that to you because you're the one sleeping.
Exactly.
Since you're asleep, time passes quickly for you, but to everybody else, it seems like a legit three hours.
...Yeah.
You know sometimes you're down there just laying there like this with your eyes open!
I know you're relaxing, we're not debating that.
..Fine.
You didn't drop anything.
No more hiding under the desk, right?
Okay.
You're watching Jake and Amir right?
Whoa! New haircut.
You're kidding right?
It's obviously terrible
So you sit down you were like; 'oh hey maam can I have the worst haircut ever?'
Sounds about right, good job.
Yeah
I don't know what you want me to say.
Stop- It's fi-
Dude I got you!
Gotcha! Buddy?
I was kidding, your-you got me?
Got me.
Look at you; you're not really sad.
You don't care.
We've got each other.
We got each other
We got...okay, we have each other we have each other! We have eachother we have each other!
Mad About You?
No, I know...
You bragging?
Well percentage-wise it's still the same.
This is why I can't talk to you, okay? Ten seconds in, and we've hit a wall. You need a basic un--
Don't touch my lips, please--
Okay, yeah, you ha--
No, no-w-what the fuck was that?!
No, no, you just puked on the floor.
No, not anyway, you have to clean it up.
..Yeah...
Oh my God, you're so unheal----OAH!  What the F*** IS WRONG WITH YOU?
I'm adequately reacting; you just sneezed puke into my face, okay, how do you want me to react?
I don't count.
There's puke on your chin.

amir:
Woah! Dude, dude. Wow, oh my god. You're in the vending machine.
You're insulting my intelligence while you're stuck in the vending machine.
Ok. How did this happen?
Two day?!
It's Monday!
Does time fly?
Ok, so not to harp on this, but how did this happen? Why?
Sure.
Ok, long version.
Gotcha. So the abridged version is a lie.
I was gonna get a Dr. Pepper, but now I should probably go and get you help.
Oh, no! No no no no! Oh my god Amir, I'm so sorry! Oh no no.
Oh my god, oh no no no no no it's blood. Um, so, are you ok?
Ok, that's good. Keep on singing, keep on singing, I'll be right back. I'm gonna get help
Wow! That's awesome!
Ha! Dude, ex-girlfriends are the worst!
There you go. You're a good guy, David. Do you know that?
Cool. All right, yeah.
Uh-huh?
Geez, man. He's so stupid. Why, what did he do to you?
Me too. I like him. He's funny. We get along. Me and Amir like--
Not too much, dude. Just finishing lunch with the new guy, Dave.
I said we finished eating lunch.
That's three guys he said--
What do you mean?
Lottery school! Jake is in lottery school. I'm in lottery school.
Yeah, I didn't cut him early enough, did I? Lottery school!
. . . What?
Wow, you are--
You're serious then? Cool.
So you're uh, you're just going to go for it.
HEY SARAH!
Yeah.
Fine, whatever.
Shut up!
Yes. Yes. Yes.
Shut up.
Oh.
No. OK, no. I like working. You know, why don't you take this somewhere else?
What's that? What's nose candy?
Sugar?
You guys do cocaine during work?!
No, you're taking advantage of him, man!
Really?  Grown man? Look at him right now!
Yeah, I thought so too, David.
I was making a point.
And I know that you don't have a motorcycle!
Do you?
OK. Went out on a limb there. Didn't really pan out. Sorry about that. Cool. Like a Harley or--?
Davidson, that's nasty. That is cool, man. Umm, sweet, sweet, sweet.  Still shouldn't do drugs though! That's messed up. Umm, tell you what. We'll flip a coin right now, heads - you guys keep up doing your stupid little nose candy stuff, tails - you never do drugs again.
AH! Ah! Ah!  Umm, OK, it's on, I think it was on heads but it flipped . . . I-I-I will uh, which one was which again?
Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir.
...Yup.
GreatYes, I got it! Great job, man. Maybe next time you start
You're not dyslexic.
You're illiterate.
Illiterate.
No! No, I know what that look is; you just convinced yourself that I said you were cute, and not illiterate.
Any day, and I know you'd take that. I'm not giving it, okay? I didn't say you were cute.  No, what is that? Do you think I'm singing you a very fast-paced song?
Okay, you know what, forget it. I'mwow, do you see this email?
Did you see it, or are you asking what's up?
We're moving offices.
Did you say, Batmat?
Okay, it is a big deal, all right? It's gonna be a totally different office.
Your commute might be a lot longer!
Forget it! The one upside to this is maybe I won't have to sit next to you anymore.
Are you actually crying now?
Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir
Are you trying to convince people he's here?
Do you know what this move's about?
No, we're moving offices.
Technically, but just offices.
I remember that. My second day here. It was pretty creepy.
Don't force it.
Don't force it.
What up, bitch? I'm the class clown here.
Dude, no, no
OhOH MY GOD!
What are some of your favorite words? Mine might match up. Your jeans fit you insanely well, and your attitude is ridiculously cool.
Yeah...
That's the opposite of true.
No, it's not true
You're just like the ocean under the moon. It's the same as the emotion that I get fromYeah, you just, like, kinda transcribed Rob Thomas for a while there.
It wasn't...
This is the only thing you have in here.
Just don't.
Those are Sarah's scissors; she bought them yesterday.
Okay, no, Sarah! Sarah
How do you think that's up to you?
Still not up to you, but...
Why'd you do that?
Nope.
Yeah, those aren't free; those are people's lunches.
So you're aware you're stealing them?
Okay, I should probably get back to work.
Hey, hey, hey! New office, right? We probably shouldn't be yelling stuff like that out loud.
No.
Okay, well, I said I didn't want to do that so it's not an issue.
Definitely hear you... He'sYou're closer to him than you are to me.
Just do it in a normal voice.
Don't shoot; I came to give these to Marina.  Okay, fine.  Um..
Okay, thank you.  Um, so I printed this from the new printer; it's over.. by the conference room.
Right here, yeah. You already said that.
Just go back to your desk. Right now. Please.
Thank you.
Yep.
Distance.
Yeah.
Get.. off of me.
Get off of me.
You sound like you're going, but you're still standing here. So I don't know what to think.
OK, you know what? No! No. I know what this is about; he called me seven times in the past few days to come in here and talk about switching desks and I'm not doing it! I'm not going to switch desks.  I don't want to be near you. I don't want to be near Amir, not in work, not outside of work. I want some time apart. Which is sad for me to have to say because it sounds like we're going out or something. We need space.
I . . . I accept.
Pshhh, it's fine, I'll go. We'll- I'll go to the game, so.
Inside the office.
Yeah!  Oh my god! You guys thought I was serious?  You are the weakest links, goodbye.
Yeah. Yeah I do.
Yeah . . . yeah, buddy. God, I'd love to sit across fr-- you know what? You know what the problem is? Murph, the guy across from me now, total buzz kill, he doesn't want to switch. It's ridiculous! But when is our flight though? To Miami?
Don't make me twist your arm!
This morning?! God, I had no-- wow, I really had no idea. Look, can we just go, can we just go to Miami, sir?
Can we go?
Aww, sick son  Motorola is sending us to Miami!
Whoa, no. Get away from me. I can't have lunch with you. But I'll meet you at the airport! The Miami airport. Unless my  flight gets in before yours, in which case I will see you at the hotel, motel, Holiday Inn. At the-- All right, see you at the hotel, baby.
Oh! Man! . . . I have to get swim trunks.
Why are you crying?
right we got an interview with an actual NFL player. His name is Chris Cooley, He plays tight end for the redskins.
yeah don't. are you gonna tell that joke in there?
Yeah so let me do the talking, K
Well his wife in there so let's try to keep the questions..
hey
We just asked everybody if they had any other ideas and you didn't say anything.
It's not not about listening.
It was in 2D.
I'm not.
Which is why I'm not on board. You are very close to me, man.
Can we go?
Ok let's not thank them in a rap. Let's not thank them in a rap.
Stop it.
We want to thank you guys so much for donating.
No, donating money exactly.
And the only way I could convince Amir to do this. Ok.
Every little bit makes a difference.
Yeah, focus.
What are you doing? How are you gonna do that?
We'll figure it out?
By working toge- you know, I just feel like it's really really insincere if you're doing that--
Ok what's that, what is that--
What does that do?
Can you please put it down?
What are you donating?
It's not.
Ok. Do it.
Out with the wallet.
Take away- take out your wallet.
Joking aside, we really do appreciate your donation. I know not everyone has a lot to give, but if we--
...Come on. Right? Come on.
Joking aside,--
That sounded kinda good at the end, you were really on.
You're just repeating what I said, OK, that's not helpful.
If you tickle me I'm gonna punch you in the head.
Sorry.
Yeah.
Gotcha.
Take it. It's fine.
Is everything OK?
Fine, get it.
I told you it was okay.
Uh, madame is girl. I really- I can just finish this up on my own.
Yeah.
Go ahead.
Yeah yeah that's fine.
No I don't.
Yo, man.
Not much, dude. I'm just super creeped out right now.
Oh, not much. Just set up this iChat thing to watch me while I work.
Yeah. Only it wasn't Murph. It was you.
K. Look, I'm not trying to be mean, okay, it's just a fact: Switching desks is not going to happen, okay? Get used to it.
You were covering the lens, not the microphone.
Murph just walked into Ricky's office and he said, Hey, I need to switch desks. I guess he had some friends over at the Busted Tees area that he missed.
I know.
No.
Hey, you're watching-
Wrong.
Jesus!
K, just try not to think about it, Ok, 'cause I don't wanna think about it.
Ok. Is it?
I don't know, man, it's like six months away.
Wow, so that's even worse.
Fill 'er up through 2011?
Definitely not.
A barty?
Party at a bar? Like you invite people to a bar-party?
Ok, you know what, no, Amir! Hey. Hey, hey, hey look! look! look! I don't even know what I'm doing this year for my birthday!
You do?
Yeah, I think we're not.
We're definitely not.
Where are we going?
Did you say that, knowing you didn't know where we were gonna go, when I asked you where we were gonna go?
I'm kinda confused too, let's just, let's just drop it.
Drop it like it's hot.
How'd you get this number?
What?
If you hang up and call me back I'm not gonna pick up.
But you had time to call me again?
Ok
Stop it
Nothing
I didn't ask you
Nope
Definitely not
A bum? Are you serious?
Oh my god that's so much worse. You re-step- a baby?
How do you not know what it is?
Oh my god
Well it's 3pm so breakfast is pretty much off the table, right?
Do you think I understand what you're saying when you sound like that?
Dammit, you're right
Wow, don't care
I don't want anything
You know what, why don't you just not call me when you're walking to work? I have to talk to you when you get to work, so that's pretty much terrible to begin with.
Yeah, I said it to you on the phone. How'd you get here so fast?
So you just click this button and it launches a video chat with a random person
Yeah, and like one in every 5 people is just a dick
It's awesome, Yeah
Oh! Look, right of the bat
No... no.. no..
I don't wannna look at it
Yeah, except we're not the naked ones
What makes you think that's better?
I know what it is
No!
Did you hear me say 'no'?
Okay, you're not going to make me feel bad...
You sure about that?
Did you get that cake I left you on your desk?
Okay. Okay Amir, buddy, the jig is up okay, we know you're under the desk
Okay now I just realised I heard your actual voice in here so I'm just gonna throw you some pants and you can cover yourself up, alright?
Hey you're watching Jake and Amir.
Recording the intro.
It's really easy you just; close your eyes, pucker your lips-
Don't do it to me
Did you drag that couch over here?
so where is the pie?
I saw your head the entire time.
Are you ok?
Hurt your back?
You know it's actually really cool.
Rosy wasn't that good?
Yeah. That would be cool.
Nah, no it would just be so cool and funny if you just took the escalator back up.
Is it?
You didn't bring a pie.
You weren't holding that in your hand when you came up
You should take the stairs back down.
Hell yeah, two at a time that would be really ace.
Hey take the trampoline back up, just jump as high as you can. Then we'll go to my apartment and do the "elevator, escalator" and the "stairs" all night man we could hang out.
As long as you can as long as you'd handle that.
Yeah
Wow, are you ok?
Oh no!
You know if you're sick you should just go home
Yes
Usually people follow that up with never will
But you're definitely sick
Okay so there's no way that I'm right?
Then why on earth would I let you cough into my mouth?
I'm not questioning your confidence, I'm questioning what you're confident of
Is that from something?
That makes it so much worse, I'm not letting you sneeze into my mouth
The exact opposite actually
You don't know what opposites are that's okay
That's technically true though you probably should
Interesting. Do you know what a heart attack is?
Diabetes?
Malnourishment?
Three things that can kill you. Malnourishment probably is killing you right no-
Cough into my mouth? No. Are you crazy?
So predictable. Yeah, yeah I do
What were you gonna say then?
Did you fall asleep or something?
Hey, Pat. Didn't you have a date this weekend with that marketing chick, Daphne?
How'd go? Where did you take her?
Did you...finish?
No...I dunno.
Probably, yeah.
Fine fine fine fine. Nobody's gonna get fired. Amir, why don't you just get off.
It wasn't
Something bothering you?
If you're upset just tell me what it is, don't make the noise just tell me what's bothering you and we'll talk about it
Just tell me what it is!
Sorry man
Sorry to hear that
Both?
I agree, yeah
Okay I'm gonna stop you right there I didn't do that
I'm sorry that a wolf ate your dog,  I didn't have anything to do with it
You did, it was the only thing you said to me actually
Yeah
Sure yeah, it would have been
Yes! That it would have been clever if you were right
I still feel like maybe you think I killed your dog
Do you think I'm a wolf?
You don't even have a dog? What are you talking about?
Don't get sentimental and try to make me feel bad, this is the stupidest thing you've done in a long time and you carved my initials into your hand last week
Oh god, you opened it up
It's never gonna heal if you keep doing that-
Yoda?
Ricky said you threw hot coffee in Rosie's face this morning.
On purpose.
It's definitely going down, they said you just like walked up, didn't say anything, you just threw the hot coffee in his face. Did you?
Sarah tried to help him and you picked her up by the neck and threw her to the ground.
I don't know if you're listening to me, but you're probably going to go to jail for this. The very least you'll be arrested, I think the police are on their way.
So you are hearing me, ok. This is the second time you've really hurt Rosie.
Ok, so now I see where you were going with all that. I'm not going to do that though.
This is some seriously depraved shit man, and I'm not covering for you.
Don't talk about deep down inside me, ok.
Yeah right, what?
Ok, fine fine. Go hide, go hide.
Snow, huh. If it were any color other than white, it wouldn't be as beautiful.
Hey! You're watching Jake and Amir!
Good, great job!
Push it! Ju--Push it!
You did lose your cool there for a second
Yeah!
Perpetuated and greeting were the words you were looking for there, okay? And you're thinking of
I'd prefer if you per-didn't.
So you're definitely filling out your bracket wrong.
You spelled a lot of things wrong. You know North Carolina's not even in this tournament.
Exactly.
Wow.
No I got it, that's why I said 'wow'.
laughs
I laughed
What are you doing?
No.
Yeah and you have all fifteen seeds in your final four.
You're never gonna be a genius.
Please, please don't.
It's called 'Syracuse' not 'Zero-cuse.'
You didn't answer, you asked.
No.
I said it wasn't weird.
Is that a swastika?!
And?
Anything else?
Wow...
No, you obviously don't if you're the one wearing that.
Doesn't explain...  this .
Still, I can't imagine that's appropriate attire for yoga, or.. work, especially.
You walked to work in that?
Ugh, you're not wearing any shoes!
It's snowy outside?
..That's it!
Wow, no, you're already wrong. You know what, put on socks, put on shoes, put on pants, put on a shirt--
What? Huh?
Gimme a break?
--Right--
No I was saying put on.
Okay, forget it, that's not the phrase.
Wow, so you haven't even been to yoga yet?
You're not enrolled in a yoga class?!
...Okay, you're right. I'm sorry.
No.
No, we're definitely not--
Not a lot of time.
Whoa. Hmm... I forgot this was today. Listen, this is Jake and I'm an actor that he hired. So...
This is all a dream. Everything is a dream, so its time to wake up.  Wake up. Wake up. Wake up.  Wake up!
Oh god, sorry.
I thought you were gonna pass out or something.
Okay, I'm sorry. Sorry.
Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir. Great, you didn'toh no. Is he breathing?
That's not funny.
Yeah I guess.
No, no, 25 is right
You guys know you can sit over there, right?
No, you guys smell like fishsticks.
Yes.
No, it's not fine. Look, what are you guys even doing here?
What? You acted like you didn't even want them to come. Okay you know what, nevermind, everytime I catch you in a lie you can
That made no sense. And you smell like fishsticks.
Wow, are you on YouPorn?!
Who the f**k are you winking at?
Hey you're watching Jake and Amir!
Not talking to you.
So sore.
Didn't say sorry I said I was sore. My muscles are sore.
My muscles are sore from working out in the gym, In a workout.
I got up, I got up and I went to the gym. Regular crunches, bicycle crunches, pushups, diamond pushups!
Yeah that's true, that's true... I wouldn't, but umm...
I Didn't think about it until now actually... Ha, how was your weekend?
That is cool, mine was fine too, mine was a little crazy, mine was like too crazy. Don't tell anybody, but I did something illegal.
I did... I downloaded Avatar on Bit Torrent. I Bit Torrented it.
Yeah, favorite part on three: one, two, three!
Not for me, no. My favorite part was the dragons. Big-ass dragon at the end, Toruk Makto.
We should go to a club.
We should just go to a club after work, would be really fun.
What is wrong with you? Why is you dick out?
Hey everybody! We just wanted to say thank you so much because we reached 75,000 Facebook fans and thats really cool.
I said Id make the video and and Im going home.
Thats cause I did not think you were booking me for the entire time, sorry-
Hey, you're watching Ja--
Why?
Why?
Do you think I said what??
...
I didn't say anything.
Yeah, I didn't. You did, which makes you a--
Fine.
Why do you think you need one?
What's it? What is it revolutionizing?
It's not that small.
No. It's not--
No, it's not.
No, No.
Name one thing that it does.
Ok, so not nothing.
Don't say exactly and go like this , like you did something smart, because you're very dumb, okay, it didn't make any--
Okay, yeah, I know why it's so great though.
It's a new way to view it,
Media... and, it's got.. um.. there are.. it's got apps, you can check your email,
Shut up. Shut up, man, okay. You're putting me on the spot.  It revolutionizes it!
He's gone.
Hey, you're wat-
I wan't talking to you
Kunal
And to tell you how to help choose this year's winners by voting in The Webby People's Voice Awards.
We didn't win one.
We never won a Webby.
We don't know if we're nominated yet.
Well, we agreed to help them out
Don't do this. Don't do this. You were cc'd on every email; you never had a problem until now.
What agent?
Well, fine, I think you should do it then.
We're already shooting it; we're already making it.
No...
That's sexist.
Let's just check out some of this year's nominees, and then go vote for your favorites in The Webby People's Voice Awards.
Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir.
Shut up, shut up!
Wow, this is my Xbox. I just bought it. What happened?
So Sarah said, And Sarah was all like,?
Nobody said that!
So he said his name was Byron and he likes curfee. Cause that sounds like something you would say, because you don't know his name is Bryan and you don't know how to pronounce things, like coffee.
Oh my God, just get to the Xbox!
Wow, what happened to my Xbox? This is ace. Dinner tonight?
I never said that!
Didn't I?
Ah.
We're not a TV show
We're at the office.
I'm doing my taxes and I don't have a lot of time so please give me a second.
You have to do your taxes.
Yes, legally.
Did you make any charitable donations this year?
No.
That's so sad.
it's sad because it's true.
Yeah, they'll get that...
Maybe if McDonalds was your job.
your skin looks really yellow.
Okay do you have any other source of income besides your salary, like do you do freelance?
I didn't actually--
Yeah well there's a you in there
Let's finish the taxes--
I didn't say rap.
Not givin a shit?
What award?
Not true.
We've had more than a million viewers.
I think you should keep that to yourself.
Okay.
You think I'm from Toronto? And you think I want to go there, right now... to have sprite?
Why'd you just say you had a small penis?
Bird man?!
My hip-ho- I don't have a hip-hop career.
Alright?
No?
Yeah, no you're right, I'm going back to work then.
No, I can't go back to work?
...I'm not talking.
Who the hell are you?
JOPE?
Don't-
speak so close to me! Who's Drake?
That's Drake?
Okay I'm g-
Why would we go to a Drake concert?  We have work.
I don't want to go to a Drake concert-
I ACTUALLY DO NOT WANT TO GO-
AHHH... OH MY GOD...
AHH... AHH
OKAY! I'll go to the Drake concert-
I'll go to the Drake concert-
FINE I'LL BE YOUR FRIE-
Okay we'll have fun-
You are watching Jake and Amir!
Yes, yet.
Craig?
By not talking during work?
How does that save you any time?
I made a promise to myself that I wasn't going to get mad at you anymore, because it only stresses me out and it seems to have no effect on you. So...
How does wiping before you shit save you any time?
I would like to know how.
I believe you that you believe it's a time saver.
Ok, but just tell me how it saves time.
You're just explaining that you do it.  But you're not saying why it saves time.
Ok!
That's fine!
Good!
All right.
I don't think it saves anytime but, we can agree to disagree.
We don't have to agree on everything and that's fine.
You are wrong sometimes.
Because this doesn't change the two things that you have to do which is shit and wipe. It just switches the order. Maybe if you didn't wipe at all, but...
You don't switch the order of things and save time.
But, OK.
Ok
It doesn't save time.
Boop boop bedoop, It doesn't save time.
Well, whatever. That's a bad song anyway. Ok.
I'm going to kill you!
HOW IS IT A TIME SAVER? YOU'RE STILL WIPING, YOU'RE STILL SHITTING. YOU'RE STILL DOING BOTH THINGS.
EXPLAIN IT TO ME. EXPLAIN IT.
That's it?
That's really unsanitary. But I can see how you might say that's a time saver.
It still doesn't make any sense but, I can see your logic.
I'll kill you.
Hey everybody! This is Jake, and you're watching Jake and Amir.
Okay.
Oh, damn it! Damn it. My computer crashed. I had a script on there, and I didn't save it.
Yeah. Thank you.
It's fine.
Can you...
Yeah, I agreed.. with you that it sucks, okay? Let's move on.
I'm not crying. I'm not crying.
It'sIt would
TheyFine. Tears would not help them out
Wow, this wouldn't even be nice if I were upset.
You eat cat food?
Wow! This is great; it was on AutoSave.
Yeah! I got the file back.
It's not.
Thank you.
I'm gonna get back to work.
What are you talking about?
Hi Mom, happy mother's day. I'm sorry I couldn't come home. But- But I'm gonna make you this video card, and I wrote and acrostic poem for you. Here it is: Laura. L is for your long hair-
What are you doing?
What are you doing?!
How?
Poetry's not gay.
A is for your arms, young and strong.
What?
What would you have said?
A is for aura. Young and strong. U is for umbrella-
Come on.
Don't just insult me, alright? God! It's easy to say un-this or un-that, but theres no un that's a positive that I could use in the video.
U is for unyielding, in your unrelating love.
What?
Unre- I said that, you f***!
U is for unyielding, in your unrelenting love. And R is for... Just tell me what you have here, I hate mine.
Oh! You spit all over me! Shu- Shut up. This is a rough draft.
It's a pasta she used to make.
Spaghetti, but that doesn't start with an R, alright?
R is for raising me. A gift that you continued to give me throughout my childhood. A is for arms-
Yup.
She has two, right? Does she have two arms? How many arms does she have?
Okay.
I am gonna go for it.
I will.
A is for appreciation, which I owe you eternally. Happy mother's day.
I didn't do that, so don't-
This is great. Thanks, man.
What did you get your mom?
Wow... Didn't you say it's also her birthday?
Okay...
'Cause why expend shit?
Okay, no. Because you already gave it to me.

Whoa! Hey! Hey! No!
Why?
'Whoo!' what?
No! You can't!
You did something to me! You kicked cereal into my face!
She's defending you! And that is the phrase! I can't believe this, this is insane! I have to go home now!  I have to go home and shower! .
OK, well it doesn't matter 'cause I'm just gonna go....
Hey hey hey! Good bye!
Hey you are watching Jake and Amir
That's it
You think you could solve the Rubik's Cube?
So do you want the Rubik's Cube?
Sorry about that
I thought you were ready
Ya, you asked me for the Rubik's Cube so yes I threw it on purpose
Not that I meant to hurt you
I don't know
That's your hand
That's your hand
Stop saying that! Why would that make you feel better?
Why do you wanna make me feel worse?
Don't. stop. don't. Amir. please don't. stop. stop it!
You weren't scared you never saw it coming
You're right with at me and look here  that hurt my forehead alright we're even
Alright, hey  now you owe me one
Wow, not even close.
It's a newspaper.
Okay, what?
I was reading about this oil spill.
Well there is news and its bad news.
I hate when you're accidentally right.
Basically there was an accident and there is a well pumping hundreds of thousands of gallons of oil into the ocean every single day.
Wow they actually thought of that and it's insanely disappointing that you're coming up with the same solutions as they are.
For the world.
For the world.
Yeah.
The rig would never explode
Can you go back to your desk?
That's actually kind of clever.
Okay never mind.
Yup.
With the oil spill?
Why would you bring that up now?
You might be right, you might be right.
No problem, man.  I'll go to a Yankee game anytime.  Hey, speed up a little bit, you're going like 8 miles per hour.
It's 65.
How'd you get the tickets, by the way?
Why not, dude? It's inter-league play, at Yankee Stadium, it's pretty cool.
All right, pull over.
Pull over, man.
I said pull over, all right? I don't want to go to Cincinnati.
We are not almost there, we just left, OK? And the game is in two hours, we're going to miss it.
But we're still missing the game.
Doesn't sound like it's in Cincinnati, it sounds like it's in Overbeck.
OK, well I don't want to go on road trip number one, so just please pull over.
OK, pull--Watch the road! Watch the road!
Geez! You're going to kill both of us.  You're going to kill us.  Let me drive.
I know a short cut.
Wow, you are so wrong.
Hey.
Hey!
Not too much, you fell asleep while you were taking a s***.
Well you were on the toilet, and you were sleeping, so.
Why is the door open?
Yeah I know you were asleep, but thank you for being honest on your second try; doesn't explain the door.
It's four in the afternoon.
Ok, yeah, closing it should be the first thing you do, though.
Ya zonked out, well you had time to take your pants off, so I know you're lying.
Don't.. try to touch me. It's not even that I'm mad. It's just that we were about to start a meeting, you excused yourself, you said I'll be back in one second, and I asked you where you were going, and you said I'm going to get everybody treats.
Nonono, don't.. worry about that. It's just, Ricky said that he didn't think it was such a good idea, and then you winked at him , and you said  trust me, when I get back with these treats, it's gonna be a good idea,  and then he said Trust me, it's not, and then you said I will be back in thirty seconds, forty-five tops , the treats are on my desk, I just forgot to bring them to the meeting. And that was forty-five minutes ago.
Well you already asked for permission and he said no, so now you have to ask for both.
Sure, do you want me to wet the toilet paper?--
Are you f***ing crazy, you think I'm gonna wipe you?
Good job.
..Never mind.
A little fat? C'mon man, you're a blimp in this picture. There's nothing little about it.
More like Fat Cassels, right?
Same what?
Same same what?
Hey, don't make fun of him too much, Pat might get mad and eat us.
Well, I'm gonna go back to w--
Wow, that was really bad.
So you did hear me.
Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir.
Fine.
Wow, you are still playing with that toy.
It's not a toy; it's a 3D puzzle game, meah MEAH! You know what you sound like, man? Heh... Show me how to solve it.
Just show me how to solve it.
No, no, no, what could you possibly teach me?
Okay, well then why aren't you doing it?
Amir, Amir, I know it's simple. Otherwise, you wouldn't be able to do it.
Why don't you teach me how to do it; then I'll show you how well I can do it, a LOT weller than you could ever do it.
And then all the other steps are getting all of the other blocks the same, right? Why don't you not tell me WHAT to do, but tell me HOW to do it? How! Now!
Okay, cool. You're gonna treat me like a baby, then I'mma leave.
And you're not even gonna try to stop me. WOW, you're the worst teacher ever, and yet I'm still able to learn from you. ...And I will master the art.
I know what algorithms are.
Well, what are they?
I was the first kid in my grade to be able to solve one of these actually, y'know that? And then, I was like, Oh, there's a lot more important things to worry about, like getting laid! So I became the master of that.
I'm gonna beat you right down, if you don't slow down, right now, okay? All of that went right over my head.
How random would it be if I just punched you in the head right now?
Right, directly, in the skull. Knocked out your lights.
Scared? Scared? Who has the upper hand? 'Cause you know what, kid? There are book smarts, and there are street smarts. And I got both; you got neith
Wow, that took you, like, four hours. Congratulations, that was amazing. Thethe slowest solving of the Rubik's Cube ever!
Wow, check it out! I gotyo, I solved the cube! Everybody!
Very funny; who locked the door?
I might run out of air in here!
Oh no! I'm gonna die!   No, I'm not, 'cause I have a cell phone, and I'll text someone to come let me out!
Hey, you're watching Jake and Am-
How? You weren't moving.
You know, that sounded really planned out actually, and you still didn't get it right.
I'm filling out my world cup bracket.
It's not too late, it starts this weekend.
Yeah.
I have U-
I'll tell you-
Go to the bathroom.
I'm not yelling about it, you just screamed 'excuse me Mr. Officer' and you clearly shit your pants, so go to the bathroom.
We're on the third floor
I got Spain. Go to the bathroom.
Y-yeah, no...
They're on to you, I have nothing to do with this.
You shouldn't have called any attention to it, ok? Why don't you just say you farted
I don't understand why you haven't gone to the bathroom yet.
You know who I got, I got Spain.
You can still get out of this.
Go to the bathroom-
Why are you crying?
Oh, wow.
What do you mean get out? This is an office.
No, it's an office.
You can't be here like this.
What?
There probably is.
I know you're naked, we're on the same page about that. Why are you embarrased about me seeing you naked when there are all these other people around?
You wanted to surprise me with this?
Stop. Look, your plan was to give me this painting?
You should have serious doubts about it, ok? That's a horrendous plan.
Yes.
No.
You're doing it wrong.
It is, yeah.
No, you're not. You don't understand how auctions work.
Neither do you.
What money? You just spent two hundred and fifty dollars.
What?
Gotcha.
Hey, it's Jake and Amir
What are you doing?
Ya
I really hope you're not talking to me.
I didn't. Did you send me a letter?
I said I didn't get the letter.
Why would you intentionally leave things ambiguous?
OK, well I'll let you know.
Where'd you send it? Where'd you send the letter? What name and address did you put on it?  Cool, so I'm not going to get the letter.
I'm not going to get the letter, not if you didn't put a name and address on the envelope.
OK, you shouldn't.
Even if I did get the letter--
--I don't think I'd laugh about it. I definitely wouldn't crack up.
How is that changing the subject?
Still sounds like we're talking about the letter.
OK, you know what? I got the letter.  I got the letter and it's at home and I'll read it and we'll talk about it tomorrow.
How do you know that?
Oh my god!
Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir.  Wow, these are easier without you.
What are you doing?
It's 9:30 in the morning.
Are you eating crabs?
Looks like it's mostly crabs.
How did you get crabs?
How she said what?
You're getting further away from it.
Where did you get crabs from around here?
Wow, so you bought crabs from a guy at, like, at a stand?
Like a lunch truck...?
So you bought crabs from a total stranger without any concern of foodborne illnesses?
Okay, well, I think you smashed them enough, all right? You're getting pieces of shell and meat everywhere.
Oh my god, you bought live crabs, and you brought them into the office.
Wow, everybody tuck your pants into your socks!
How both?
Not clever.
Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir.
Good, great job.
Wow, this is a very strongly worded all email
It's a very strongly worded all email.
Yeah. You know everybody at the company gets those, right?
So 120 people just read your email: Who the f**k stole my headphones? Return them at once or I'll kill you.
They're around your neck. You were just listening to music on them.
You also just said pay to play, which doesn't make any sense in this conand here's another all email from you: The coward
And it's a link to the Rick Roll video.
You just wrote another emailI don't know how you're sending them so fastbut this one's a picture of Kayne West and it says,
I think you're like one step behind me, alright. People are responding to be removed from the thread. So maybe justokay, here we
You can see it, you can see exactly who sends the emails.
Don't send that. Just put your hands up, alright. Stop typing. Okay, so you wrote never. Respond verbally, to me.
You wrote unsend. You keep sending the word unsend. Unsend, unsend, unsend. Please do not read, I'm begging you. The
Now. You're sending emails. How do you like that? Do you like being ignored? It sucks, doesn't it? Two can play the quiet game.
For more Jake and Amir check out facebook.com/jakeandamir.
You told me to say that.
An apple walnut muffin.
I mind if you do.
It's an apple walnut muffin so apples, wal...
Ok if you're allergic to apples then just spit it out.
What else are you allergic to?
Alright, so you're listing things that are in muffins and then you also said muffins so definitely spit it out.
You're probably safe there but I'd still spit it out.
I didn't give it to you, you took it from me, knowing full well it was an apple walnut muffin.
Did you think my muffin was a computer?
You're not gonna die!
What President died from a muffin?
Not true.
Spit it out! Spit it out!

amir:
You're watching Jake and Amir.
I dunno man.
No Amir, I don't, because for some reason you went onto my computer last night and you deleted every single one...
You're pregnant?
You're pregnant?
Fine, you're pregnant, ok.
I have my doubts, yeah.
Why don't you say all the reasons you think you're pregnant and I'll say all the reasons I think you're not.
You're a guy.
You're a guy.
You're a... tender breasts?
Guys can't get pregnant.
What did you have for dinner last night?
So that sounds...
You keep saying expired...
You're not pregnant; and you shouldn't cry into bread.
I doubt you've passed any test, ever.
Wow.
Did you take it out of the box?
So you didn't just pee on the box?
I didn't think that 'til now. Let me see the box.
Yeah it's unopened and you definitely peed on it.
I'm supposed to beI'm supposed to be in it, right?
Don't have time for that.
I thought you were just gonna roll through the names; we definitely don't have time for five minutes.
Uh, a year.
Please...
Just.. relax.
Amir.
I'm gonna stopI'm gonna stop recording.
No, trust me, Mr. Lanzo, it will not happen again, I--
Ow.
You tackled me.
No.
I was on the phone with my landlord.
And I might get kicked out of my apartment.
So I need to call him back, right now.
OK, that one didn't even make any sense.
If you're me, then what's my ATM pin number?
SHHH-All right. Fine.
What word can I never pronounce correctly?
Hierar-har...
Uh, yeah. Fine. What was my first pet's name?
INCORRECT!
Oooh, yeah, Lady.
What?
OK, get off of me or I'm going to start hitting you.
Not cute.
Okay, it's recording.
You said all I had to do was set up the camera.
I'm not certified.
I'm not certified.
I obviously don't agree.
I agree, because you agree to pay the entire fine if that happens. Right?
Fine.
Okay, I think you're breathing through your nose.
It's attempt number two.
You're clearly cheating.
They can see that.
That.
God, that's worse than before. Cut.
Alright: what are you doing?
Why edit? Why cheat? Why are you trying to cheat?
Okay, let's just do one honest attempt. Okay? No cheating.
No cheating.
Ready?
Oh my God!
I cut it. I cut it.
You browned out! Oh, man!
Seventeen minutes! That's amazing!
Oh my God!
Oh, you browned out!
Is the red light on?
Ohhh, no, no, no...
I definitely got it. Don't worry.
You're on a typewriter.
I didn't check it the first time.
Oh.
You think the ding is like a sending noise.
That's not plugged into anything, so how is it going to send an e-mail?
That's not a good argument.
Impopsicle?
You're an idiot.
I didn't get an e-mail from you, OK? Why don't you just tell me what it said?
That's how that works. Yeah, I ask because I don't know.
All right.
You didn't ever send it.
It's not in an aether, never made it to the aether, all right?
Nope! You're not overanalyzing it. I'm not going to send you an e-mail.
OK, I just sent you an e-mail.
Hey, you're watching
Wow, c'mon.
I know.
Do you think we've been talking? You haven't said anything for two hours and that's the first thing you've said to me.
What do you do here? Seriously.
No I really want to know. Somebody asked me the other day, they asked me what your job was, and I couldn't think of anything I've
C'mon. You come into work, sometimes with a computer
Yes, you've brought it today, but like what's on it?
Okay it appears to be off.
Off.
Okay, what's the last email you sent?
Well you have a phone right, what's on your phone?
Lemme see it?
No emails, no texts, one contact, 309 outgoing calls to someone named ##zzzzhelphello696969lol, but the
I don't know what to do! I'm gonna get you fired. I'm gonna try to get you fired.
I just think it's in everybody's best interest if I just do that. The only problem is I don't know who to talk to because
Maybe I'll just talk to Ricky.
Sounds like your computer's starting up.
Did you just Google search job?
Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir.
Right...?
What is?
I guess.
They're not.
That's not cannibalism, cannibalism is when you eat your own species.
I'm saying I don't know, but either way that's not what you meant.
I feel like I've had this conversation with you before.
Hey Pat, I'm not getting your emails.
Oblivious?
Where'd you meet her?
No lines there. So you met her at your cousin's laser tag?
That's your arm. What's her name?
So you couldn't think of a name fast enough. Here's a lying tip: think of possible questions I'm going to ask
Lerona. Kinda like your cousin's name, which is Leron, except with an 'a' at the end.
Lying tip number two?
Woah.
Hey. You must be Lerona.
I am confused.
Very confused.
Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir.
For the next two minutes.
Get the fuck off? Oh my god, I'm sorry, you sounded just like Amir.
I, um... What's up?
I hope you like McDonald's.
It's... What's up?
That... no, that is...  I used to like Lord of the Rings but now I think it's gay.
Do you? I love it too! I do.
Um, wow that's hard. Oh wait no, it's not. It's The Two Towers. Remember when they're in the fields of Rohan and Eomer finds them
Stroke, not sword, but that was close. Wow that's so cool that you know it. Hey, can I ask you a question?
You do?
I was just gonna ask you why a girl as pretty as you is into Lord of the Rings.
Yeah.
Get? Haha, you got me.
You got me man, that was good.
Yeah, only we were talking about the books, you f***ing ass.
Shall not pass. Don't laugh. Are you laughing cause he was wrong?
What's madar? Is that where you're going to?
I know.
Great I'm impressing the wrong person.
Italy, right.
I see in your eyes the same fear that would take the heart of me.
The day may come when the courage of men fails. When we forsake our friends and break all bonds of fellowship. But that is not?
Yeah.
Thank you.
Please don't.
Sup!
Why?
Wow, then I'm telling Lerona then. Okay, you have a great girlfriend and you're cheating on her?
Ha! Oh man. You got me. You got me for a second. Hey put her on actually? I have this gay-ass question for her.
No, I'll ask her, okay? It's hard to pronounce.
Hey, what's up! You're at Amir's?
Oh! Where's that!
Anyway, what's up? How's your weekend?
Cool! So pimp.
Haha! Yeah I bet you were just like owning it all day. Owning the kite. Owning the sky.
Put him on, please.
Hello?
Hey dude! Didn't appreciate that. Call me back! Or text me. From Lerona's phone, cause yours obviously sucks. Mine has four bars,
Hey! You're watching Jake and a loser.
Stop! Stop. Stop it.
You were not humming.
So you're in love?
How long you've known this girl?
How long though?
How many days?
I'm being technical.
Why count that?
You're a bitch.
You just called me a bitch.
I'm-That's not what gellin' means and no, I'm not jealous of you, okay. You don't know what love is.
Okay, yeah.
I'm not.
Why wouldn't I-
Why are you being like this right now?
Why are you yelling at me though?
You said you were gonna do this one.
Hey, come in.
Yeah?
Yeah.
You know, we're not actually best friends, at all, okay.
woah woah waoh, why would he be pissed?
That's not stupid, okay, let's- I'll help.  Stay.
Yeah...We'll make him cookies.
Yeah.
Flour.
Eggs.
Butter.
Chocolate chips.
Chicken Nuggets.
Vanilla Extract.
and wine.
That's for us.
no, no, no, don't be.  That was cute.
What?!  No.  Why?
No, okay, the cookies are done.  They're good. Give him the cookies.
Try a cookie.
It's so good.
What's up?
Don't come in!
YOU were a jerk?
Yeah.
You forgot the cookies, man.
Fuck me!
This is pretty wordy.
Hey! Lerona it's Jake, I knew I shouldn't ask you out so I was hoping we could stay in.
I knew I shouldn't...I said I knew I shouldn't ask you out so I was wondering if you want us to stay in.
It's stuck.
It's not. Maybe just come down
Come down?
No no no no no no can you just...can...can you come downstairs? Maybe come downstairs?
Hi. I didn't think we should go...sorry, did you just take a shower?
Fuck
Not
I don't have a DVD, these are flowers
Yeah but you were like DVD  and
Whatever man, OK, ah hah, cos I was just leaving
Ok, you know what? Lerona, I'm crazy about you
Yeah, and you know what maybe I shouldn't have said anything but I feel like you had to know
Yeah
Yeah yeah your clothes
Jesus, man.
Just shut u-- Wow! There is a knife back here.
It's covered in peanut butter.
Still though.
No. Don't.
Are you--
Wow! What is wrong with you?!
What if she chooses me?
You just said whatever happens we'd stay friends.
So.
God, I'm so happy you chose me.
You're not a bitch.
Just like Aragorn said to Arwen before the Battle of Helm's Deep...
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh no!
Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir.
I'm not touching you.
I don't remember.
Thanks.
What?
Okay. I can't have this conversation with you right now.
Look, it happened really, really fast, alright?
Jesus Christ man, we just buried her.
I seriously doubt that.
No, I know I'm sadder than you are.
See, you're laughing.
Yeah, but she was my girlfriend when it happened.
Ha!
Okay, fair enough but we we're about to begin something new and amazing and it all got cut short.
What is?
Yeah, I guess.
They're not.
That's not cannibalism. Cannibalism is when you eat your own species.
I'm saying I don't know, but either way that's not what you meant.
I feel like I've had this conversation with you before.
Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir.
Why do you have to be in the room?
Dammit, stop!
Um
Okay, I am not playing Bros Icing Bros.
This game was popular like two months ago, and nobody's playing anymore.
No.
I think you just get deactivated from the game or something.
Just, shh! I don't know what it is because I'm not playing
Can you finish a sentence properly? You're stuttering, you just, y-y-y-you can't say anything right!
Well still, you should be able to talk! Why don't you chug it?
Okay, now you're without an ice, so , I ice you.
You don't have an ice; I'm icing you.
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!
Ice blocked! Sorry, now you gotta drink them both.
Why are you so drunk already?
Wow, on the way to work?
You should.
Milkshakes were a good idea.
Not funny.
Wow, okay, is it? Whatever.
I got it, I was just wasn't trying to be funny.
Yeah, and you didn't respond, so why do you care now?
Great.
No
I didn't ask you to leave what are you doing here, alright?
Why are you just reading them? They're not funny.
I don't know, I don't gi I don't give a crud about my stupid Twitter, I don't even know how to check
Tweets, Retweeted
Not a lot. Not a lot. There's onethere's two. One of them said it was stupid after.
Well this is me not caring: huugh! How do I delete it?
No, just the dumb tweet.
They're not all dumb. This one's funny, this one's about Inception: I understood Inception; in my dreams! Well it's like two
Sarah, did you read the...?
It's not funny if you read it out loud.
Not out loud! Not out loud. That's the dumbest thing you've ever said, I'm gonna tweet that right now.
I'm gonna delete my entire Twitter account. How's that for dumb.
Insecure about what? Because I don't have a Twitter anymore. I deleted it. Oh, crap, Jwitz ain't got one.
19760 something, but I hadn't checked in like an hour and I wasn't even sure.
That's the difference between you and me! I'm strong. And I Kev! (Mimes getting
Yes, it was hacked and deleted, and I don't know why anyone would want to delete it but they deleted the account, and I justso
Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir.
I'm not touching you.
Yeah.
What?
You shouldn't let talk to you like that.
They're wrong...
...to make fun of you.
Who's making fun of you?
I have a lot of best friends.
It'sum... I'm getting a call.  Hello?
You know what? Maybe it's the shirts, man. You gotta stop making those shirts.
But all the other ones, with our faces and our names.
Okay, but it's all the same thing, and it's weird, alright? I don't know if you're making any money off of them
Well that's also weird.
How am I losing money?
You mean hotcakes.
I would say, number one, don't worry about what other people think
and two, as far as the shirts go
Look
I'm your best friend!
They're great. I think Busted Tees is gonna sell a lot of them.
What do you think you just did?
Wow.
What are you doing? Sit there! Amir! Sit there! We have an entire couch, and I'm not gonna move because I was
Wow, actually, yes, absolutely. Are you looking for another job?
Alright, right off the bat, you've used a sample resume I'm guessing, because your name is Will B. Hired.
Yes, I did. And your email address is put@emailaddress.here.
Objective, wow. Why don't you read this out loud and tell me if it's what you want to send to a prospective employer.
What?
Under Experiences you just wrote When something happens to you; that's just defining it.
It doesn't matter.
Under Skills you wrote dunking.
Yeah, no, I know, but you can't do that.
You did, you said 10 feet.
I know but it's still--
Yeah, this, like, all this, where you listed every school, even the ones you went to when you were a baby, that's just un-- are you asleep? Are you asleep?
Proficient at Microsoft Word, right? You said you can write 500 words a minute?
You did; you're always specifying for some reason. You wrote nonsense words, and a winking emoticon.
Activities, you wrote none, which is honest, but it's probably a bad move.
Yeah but then there's a comma and you wrote music.
Still, I feel like--
Special Skills: playing DVDs.
Enjoy the ride. Yep, you wrote that. You also wrote, If it skips, cry till it's fixed.
It doesn't.
Oh! God.
For Extracurriculars you have My cousin owns a laser tag; that's not really relevant.
So you're not looking for a new job?
Jake AND Amir.
OW! What was that?
I know!
I think it's Amir's office phone.
I guess. Hey! Yo, this weekend we should, uh...
Yo!
Great. You know when you leave yourself a voicemail, it plays out loud so the entire office can hear it.
Yeah.
Where are you walking?
Webby award winning.
You can't just walk out of meetings like that.
I'm close enough.
Stop snapping at me!
You want the money electronically?
D'you buy something on eBay?
Well did you win?
So you're not gonna pay the guy.
I'm not involved.
I'm close enough.
My phones ringing.
Yes, what is going on?
What shit have you gotten me into?
Is that Mickey?
Why even pick up the phone?
But why answer it?
That wasn't supposed to be sarcastic.
I was just mugged.
No. No, I'm not; I'm just so freaked out. I feel vulnerable as hell right now
What is wrong with you?!
Oh my god...
Get off of me!
Ah! I don't wanna die! I don't wanna die!
Stop it! Stop!
He didn't even get my wallet...
No, he took my gym bag, but I had stuff in there. I had mesh shorts, I had a juice in theremy house keys! He took
They're here. They're fine, but everything else...
It's here. II put it in my pocket; I forgotbut this is not as full as I remember it.
I don't know. I don't know, 'cause it happened so fast.
Okay, well, I don't wanna talk about it anymore.
All right, fine. Thank god I put them on, and he didn't get the mesh shorts; he took my gym bag.
Well, yeah, they give 'em away for free at the gym, but he'll probably just steal it again.
I don't know, man; he's, like, eleven. They don't care about anything.
She rode her bike by and just swiped
You're being an asshole. You're being incredibly insensitive, and I can't talk to you like this.
I swear to god she made a legit swipe at this; that little bitch tried to jack me, all right?  And this juice: it was full; it was unopened!
And the mugger tried and tried and said, Gimme all your money! And I said, NO! Not today, you motherfucker! And then  he said... Nope! Not gonna tell you!  Means you gotta call me back. All right. Love you, Dad. Bye.
Going somewhere?
Okay.
No, Amir, I don't.
Good, please don't.
Don't tell me.
I'm not trying to stop you.
You're not leaving anything behind, apparently. What can't you afford?
So you were evicted?
I don't think you know what evicted means.
I would rather not.
You cannot live with me rent free.
It doesn't matter because you're not living with me.
Hey, you're watching??
What was I doing, or what am I doing now? Because what I was doing was kicking ass at Angry Birds, and what I'm doing
Ahh!
You are an anus of the highest calibre! Don't grab at my phone!
Well they're not chickens they're birds.
Yeah well it's not called Angry Chickens, it's called Angry Birds.
Well so do hens.
Is it? Is it really?
Fine, fine, I'm f**king with you. It doesn't even matter. Just shut up. Every time you talk, I'm taking away a turn. You
That's one turn lost already.
Two! That's two! You don't have to agree. That's two turns.
Three.
Three.
That's four.
That's five. We're starting. We already started.
Please be quiet with your breathing, you're f**king me up.
You're breathing really heavy!
Just shut up! Just sit back, and don't say anything.
That is bullspit, that is bullspit.
Yeah, they're probably worried that I'm not gonna be able to beat the game, but they're wrong! Cause I can play it all
WELL WHY DON'T YOU GET YOUR OWN PHONE THEN.
You will respect my authorita. Pigfucker. I need TP for my bunghole. You pigfucker. Eat that shit, you pigfucker! You make me feel like I'm
He can get his own phone, Streeter.
Streeter he can get his own phone!
That was perfect, do them all like that.
Hey, are you done working for the day?
Your headphones aren't plugged in and your computers being very loud.
Yeah
Why not just turn the sound down?
I was just gonna say if you're done with work you can just..
Go home. Okay there's no use in being here if your just gonna..
Be loud, please don't try to finish my sentences.
You were really late on that one okay.
I don't have a sandwich, you have a sandwich. You have an entire sandwich still.
Is that your voice?
That doesn't make any sense. Are you watching a movie you made?
Okay wow, this is really starting to..
Wow he's better at it than you are, look if you're going to listen to a movie at work you should at least make it so it's not so..
Racist I was gonna say, would you at least..
This sounds like it's a really bad movie
You just said it was good.
By what?
Hey, I'm just on my little brother's Facebook...
No, yeah I know. Can you delete some of the things you posted on his wall?
Sorry, that wasn't a question. Delete everything you've ever posted on his wall before.
He's seventeen.
Did he lie to you or did you maybe just read his birthday wrong on his page?
That's it. Some of these things are like offensive and others are just annoying.
Here's an example of both. 'Hey did you get my poke? Poke me back if you got it, playa. Hey, my last poke said poke me back if you got it, playa. But, everybody has poke so I'm expecting one unless you're a faggot.'
What is that?
Delete your Facebook.
You didn't do anything. You just signed his wall again 'Hey, your big bro is acting like a toolbox extraordinary. Don't get mad if I piss on his jeans tonight.'
Well I just clicked on your wall to wall and he hasn't signed yours once and you leave him like videos like this.  "Micah, it's Amir. It's two am on a Wednesday. Poke that bitch or we're done!  Nah, no that was a joke but this is very serious. Call me right now. Your brother's hurt."
You mean when he went to get a drink from the water fountain and you shoved his face into it? Yeah, he lost two of his front teeth.
You said: 'Sorry you don't have a sense of humor, bitch.'
Just leave him alone, okay?
Are you leaving him a video message right now?
So creepy, stop it.
Yes it was. What is all that?
Those are crepes?
Think I'm good.
Yeah I think I don't want
I wasn't.
I wasn't.
You have a very inconsistent style.
This food looks really old.
You thought you could eat all of this food at brunch?
What gameshow?
Why would I pay you for your huevos rancheros?
Fine.
I don't care.
You sure you wanna order get man? You got a lot of breakfast food left.
Ok, so throw it away!
You yelled at me first.
I'm ordering a turkey club, what do you want?
Ok, but that's not what I'm gett -
Hey, hey.
No, they don't have wine.
They don't have wine.
Yes, they do not have wine.
Ok, you don't get to use the mouse anymore cos you're trying to check my email
Why don't you just order on your computer, and I'll tell you what I want.
Today?
Ok, great.
I know.
So jet me order your lunch
Syrup?
No.
Ok, will you please just pay me in bills!
Kind of.
Yeah, I am.
Is that an offensive Jamaican accent?
What?
Don't say that to me.
That wasn't funny.
Sorry. I didn't think it was funny.
So you downloaded various crowd noises?
Cool.
You downloaded YMCA.
Oh! Sounds like they're booing you, man.
That couldn't have been the button you meant to press.
So now fart's a good thing?
Go home.
Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir.
Not really.
An uncle. Yes. And you asked me about the Dora tickets -- he hasn't gotten back to me--
It doesn't mean that.
No! I don't think we can swing that! I don't even think we can swing the tickets!
Okay, no. I just went to the Dora website -- the tickets are sold out and they're really expensive, so I don't think my uncle is going to get any at all!
Why are you doing this?!
You're lying to her.
Okay, my uncle just emailed me back -- he said he doesn't work at the ticket agency anymore. He got fired like a month ago.
Hey, I'm Jake and thi--
That's fine. It's- You've done that nineteen times.
Hey, I'm Jake and th--
Hi, I'm Jake, and this Amir. And it is that time of the year again.
Not how those work. It's time to submit to the Webbys.
Yes, last year's Webbys were last year.
Hey, I'm Jake and this is Amir--
Say nothing, just be natural.
Hey, I'm Jake and this is--  That is not natural.
This is much, much worse.
Wrong direction. Much, much worse?
The Webbys are looking for new submissions in dozens of categories.
What are you doing?
Why don't we just take a five minute bathroom break or something. We'll collect our thoughts, we'll come back and we'll do it again, OK?
There's only one bathroom.
Hey, I'm Jake from Jake and Amir, reminding you to get your Webbys submissions in. More info after this video.
Nobody.
I'm not, relax.
Don't touch the camera, you don't know what you're doing!
Hey you're watching Ja--
Why now?
Game, set, SNATCH! That's what you are, man, get out- don't-- hey, bow to me, bow- c'mon, hey!
No.. way. I'm not playing you on account of you suck and I don't wanna play you.
Fine. Let's go, you serve first.
Aight, your serve then.
Yeah well we rally for serve!  NOW it's your serve.
Aight I was NOT ready, I was talking, I was in the middle of a f***ing sentence.  I'm ready. Go.
DEah- euw- my point! My point! You caught it!
Yeah you hit it, that's my point!
Yes. It's how ping pong works, it's called listening.. 101.
Aight. eouh. 2-0, me.
Cuz it wasn't a legal serve! If you don't know how to serve, then don't play the game!
Ow, my point! 3-0.
Ok it grazed me!
3-0. Gimme the ball. My serve.
Well give it back!
Bad throw!  OW! AHW, you're an anus. But, uh, sneak attack!
Aight. Give it up.
It was a joke. I was kidding. Give it-- Alright. 4-0. That's.. counts now. 5-0, 5-0, not-getting-the-joke penalty. Sorry Sally Jessica Raphael, that one's lost on ya. Here it is!
Alright, crossed the table but I'll give it to you.
Doesn't matter what I mean, cuz I said I'd give it to you, didn't I? You need to learn how to be funny, man, I'm sorry, you need to learn how to be funny. Six-nil, you get one point for being a bitch, this one's for the skunk though.
Skunk! It's an 11-1 game, but hey if you don't know that, brotha, YA ALREADY SKUNKED! LATA! (He serves it into the net.
I feel bad, but I'm not gonna feel that bad cuz I smashed my face on the table before, alright.  And trust me, that one hurt me more than it hurts you! Ok?  Ah, this is gonna reserve for the skunk. Here we go!  Alright, I was talking--
Do you need a script?
No. It's 5:30.
It is. Here.
dirty work.
Got it. I actually don't want you to explain anything else because I do not want to be involved in whatever you-
How'd you meet the other ones?
Got it.
So you're paying them?
Willy Wonka never said that. Why would you pay them for candy bars?
How is that two times face?
Okay, well you know that: A) You can buy your own candy at the store and B-
So why are you paying kids literally hundreds of dollars-
Thousands of dollars!
Why are you wearing a dress?
I'm serious. It's Thursday, it's not Halloween. There's no Halloween-
So you had no other clean clothes?
You don't know who Willy Wonka is.
Who's washing a fireman's helmet?
What?
No.
I don't care what it is, all right? You're not going to get my dad's address.
OK. That's actually really mature of you.
You do not have to convince me. I completely agree.
What?
No. Stop.
You just said you wanted to take a break!
Get away for a while.
You specifically said 'go our separate ways'!
I have plans tonight.
Well, take no for an answer, OK? Because I can't just get up and go on an 8 day vacation with you.
You're using that word wrong!
Do you understand why I'm not coming with you?
No, because it's eight days long and you told me about it 30 seconds ago!
You can't make me feel bad for how you spend your money!
Does anybody want to go to lunch?
Great, one for Evan.
I did. Did you get my response about how I didn't want to do that?
No.
No.
All movies are based on a script.
Pass.
Ow-ow!
I didn't.
No.
Hey man, will you not do that right now?
Well, let's just pass on it for now.
No.
That's--Sorry. So the circles mean maybe? Because you've circled every single idea I've said no to.
That one is not even a movie.
It didn't. I said no to literally everything you pitched.
Don't think of any more movie ideas, all right? Man, you're really bad at it and I would quit entirely.
I think I'm going to go.
Well you just got back from a two and a half week long Mexican vacation.
Hey, you are watching Jake and Amir.
Wow, wow wow!
Were you waiting for me by the elevator?
So far? I woke up...
...got dressed...
...came to work.
On what?
What is that?
It's not that bad.
Hey, hey! You're doing that! Did you do this?
I didn't ask you the hamster's name, and wow, you should have thought of a name that didn't sound like toilet paper.
He didn't.
Nothing.
The toilet paper?
The bandit or you?
You're lying.
How can I trust you? You lie all the time!
Hey. Where are you?
I said 'where are you?'.
Wow, these are a lot of reckless driving tickets.
Sorry, but I'm just saying--
OK, I'm going to hang up.
OK, there's one that says you owe them eleven hundred dollars.
Just...before I keep looking, police don't do that.
It's fact.
You have tickets. You owe the police money. A lot of money.
It's Tuesday afternoon!
A zero?
Look, I know this is a small thing to bring up but before, when you first called and I said 'where are you?' and you thought I said 'how are you?' . . . you said you were good.
I do think it's your fault.
I whip my hair back and forth.
Hey, you're watching Jake  Amir.
Now.
Take that, pig f***er.
Someone's in here.
Yeah, I'm in here.
In the- Where are you? Right? You're in the bathroom. So, where am I? In the bathroom.
I said I'd be right back!
It means I'll be right back and not to follow me to the bathroom.
Just chi- Okay, I see what you did. Neither. Alright? Just go away.
No.
Hey, whoever that is, don't worry, you can go to the bathroom. It's fine.
Come on man. We have to work here, right?
I don't know, alright? I can't exactly go to the bathroom with you here talking to me.
That makes no sense, but fine.
Thank you.
Jesus Christ, man! What is wrong with you?
Yeah, you were singing!
Yes it is!
And me.
You obviously knew what it was called.
I only have one bar left.
Fine! Fine! Here. Take it.
Why did you do that?
So give it back to me!
It was my candy bar.
You took it from me!
Fine!
Why don't we just move on?
Yes, I am pissed! I said I just wish you didn't throw it away.
Whatever.
I don't know -- selfish?
Yeah.
So why'd you want one of mine?
Why do you have these?
I clearly didn't.
You just said you were watching your weight.
So, that wasn't even a joke?
Hey you're watching Jake and Amir
That's the microphone.
Hey--
My cousin just sent me the new "Auto Tune the News" clip, and you know those creepy facebook wall posts you leave me?
Like the ones late at night where you--
Well they're a song now.
That's not important.
Madeleine.
You can have female cousins.
You have a cousin named Leron.
By who?! Alright focus. Focus, okay. You're in an internet video.
Lots of people are watching it and you look like a needy loser.
I'm not even in the video. And trust me, if I were in an internet video, nobody would think I was a jerk.
What?
So they asked for your permission.
So this sounds like it's mostly your fault.
Hey, before you turn around and tell me that they can't delete the video, just know that I heard that entire--
You said you weren't going to do this.
Hey, Rosie. Rosie, come here. Check out this thing on my computer, man.
It's crazy, right?
Nice job.
All right, don't be angry.
Why are you mad? You should be happy. We did it.
All right.
Yes!
Celebration... celebration, nice.
... you look mad, so ... that's uh ...
Ow! If you don't know how to celebrate, just clap twice and go all right!
So you heard the beginning and not the end. Just clap twice and say all right.
All - no.
Okay, you're getting further away from it. This is crazy. Let's say you won the lottery, all right? What do
That is the weirdest thing you have ever done! Do you not know how to celebrate? Have you never been
This has gone SO poorly. I'm done hanging out with you, okay? You're a weird person and you have no
OH NO! Nice try! Trying to get J-Witz on the same prank? I don't think so. Suck it, fuck it, AH AH AH, bend
OW, what the fu-
Do you want people to stop watching?
Hey man you never have any food so it's a little weird when you ask me to eat with you. You also haven't blinked in a really long time, aren't your eyes dry?
You're blinking behind the washcloth.
No.
Correct!
Hahahahaha, stand up let's do it!
Nah dude, you took a beat that's a DQ.
Best 2 out of 3, best 2 out of 3.
Rock paper scissors shoot! Go to sleep, what have you got? Ooo scissors.
That's scissors man.
No no no, your fingers are separated, this is scissors, this is scissors, this is paper! Like this, cup it almost like it's rock.
No, you weren't. You gonna be a bitch about it, you wanna be a bitch about it? You want your sandwich bitch? Here have your sandwich bitch.
You're a bitch.
You're not gonna make me feel like an asshole alright, you were cheating. I'm, I'm sorry, good lunch.
You know what you're doing? You're fighting the breathing and that's what's making it more painful, it's painful breathing right? Try only exhaling.
He's fine, I apologized to him twice already.
Alright look dude if you don't stop acting like a little bitch I'm gonna tell everyone you cheated during RPS and then you're gonna look like a douche.
Alright good, you good?
You're ribs not broken? Tell me does this hurt?
We good? Pound it. Stardom shot! Oh that's not your rib so you can't be pissed at me unless you're a bitch.
You're watchin' Jake and Amir--
Come on...
So what'd the doctor say?
Don't make me feel like a jerk.
Hey
I'm not hungry but um, sounds like a good cause man, here.  Have uh, have twenty.
It's not about having the better cake, it's about having the better cause.
Come on now man.
No, Pat wouldn't do that, alright? He has to raise money for, what was her name?
And what's her disease, again?
Gingivitis, how old is she?
Ok, can I have my money back actually--
I'm sorry about the rib, alright man?
Hurry.
That's good, that's very good.
Wuwuwuwait a second,  you don't know why that joke is funny.
Why?
B-b-but why were we laughing?
You're an idiot.  You can't even have regular political banter with us .
You're beyond hope, dude, you're beyond that.
You wanna do it? Good luck.
Right off the bat he doesn't even know who this chick is.
Guy. He doesn't know who the guy is. You can't just, learn who people are.
Here's a tip. Here's a little tip for you right now. Teach a man to fish, right? You don't know who someone is? Take our your phone, type his name into Google. Julius Assand, right? My phone doesn't have service right now, but if it did, I'd be able to tell you who he is, in two seconds.
He thinks I don't know who Julian Assand is!
Wow, I always knew you were stupid, but I didn't know you were dumb, too.
I know who Mickey Mantle is. Number seven. The New York Yankees. How's that for stupid?
Born Mickey Charles Mantle. That's something you don't learn on Google.
Good lunch, everybody. I'm gonna go. Pat, you get joke of the lunch with the Julian Assand thing, which a low five from me.  Too slow! I get runner-up, second-best joke of lunch with the too slow thing, looks like I'm too school for school ; sorry just kidding, too COOL for school, not a mess-up because I caught it first. Once again y'all are too slow and once again Julian Assand can--  ah!ah! --eat a penis pie 'til the day he die. This has been a Jake Hurwitz production, a.k.a.: I'M OUT!
Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot all my food, but if you guys are still talking about Julian Assange, he's the frickin founder of Wikileaks!
You gotta learn how to be funny, man. I'll tell you.. I'll tell you exactly what Wikileaks is, right now, if you can catch my low five.
Too slow!
Ya knicked it!
You KNICKED it!
What's up? You're watching Jake and Amir.
What?
Hey- dude! I'm not gonna ask you again. Stop responding to this email thread.
Yes! We're getting them! Are you not getting them? Eleven people have replied and asked you to stop!
Darren's fiance is in the hospital.
How could you not know that, this entire thread has been about that.
No! They're not, and they're really offensive! Like you said I got a gift idea: a new fiance, because his is broken. Does anybody have the number for the slut store? I left mine in Darren's dick LOL. What does that mean?
Is it? Is this one also a joke? I saw Darren's fiance eating a cockmeat sandwich last night. Need proof? See attached pic., with no picture attached.
You did, five seconds later you said Sorry for the bogus attachment, y'all. Click here to see Darren's finance--spelled that wrong...
It's not. You said Click here to see Darren's finance in all her glory holes., but there's no link. Five seconds later you follow up with a link to a random GeoCities page that says Under Construction.
Ok, well either way--
For what?
Focus. Alright this is the last thing I'll say, and it's not directly related to this specific thread, but you gotta change your email signature, man.
It's porn.
Barely.
Ok so yes, totally, and I love it?
Alright, so it sounds like you're just trying to protect yourself against negative feedback.
Really? You could've fooled me, cuz you just sent this email, five seconds ago, while we were talking, and it's Darren's fiance with a skull and crossbones Photoshopped above her head, and it says Rest In Pieces.
Stop! Stop.
Alright, and this is my desk. Pretty fun, right?
Alright, Amir this is my cousin Madeleine.
Hey! Hey! Don't say stuff like that!
Okay, she's not ashamed.
Okay, you just said she shouldn't be.  Madeleine, it's perfectly natural.
Oh my God! You should be ashamed.
Dude, that's my aunt! You can't say stuff like this!
Yes I can. You just told her she had nothing to be ashamed of, then you went off on this rant.
Hers.
Will you please grow up?!
Wow! Alright, we are gonna go. We have Christmas shopping to do.
He's real! He's real.
I actually had a toy that I wanted to donate.
Awesome man thanks. You know where it is right, it's on like uh-
Wait, you were just there? Then why do you have a bag full of toys?
Permission not granted.
How do you have a bag full of toys if you just came from the drop centre!?
Can I have my toy back?
This is clearly not what I gave you.
Because you got toys.
What about those sick kids who now don't get a toy on Christmas because you took theirs.
So if you could give toys to everyone you would only consider it?
Biss?-
Alright, here's what were going to do, me and you, were going  down to the donation centre, together, and we'll give away the toys as a group because that's what the holidays are all ab--
I'm doing the next one.
What are you doing?
How did you get into my apartment?
Look. How did you get in here?
How did you get in?!
Those aren't my keys.
Got it. I can see that.
What did you cook.
You ordered-- So why's my kitchen such a mess?
Why'd you get pissed?
Look, trust me, I'm not going to laugh when you tell me anything. You've destroyed my kitchen.
I thought you said you didn't make it.
Chill out, chill out, okay. You don't suck.
Why didn't you bring money?
It's fine, chill out. I'll pay for it, you can owe me.
I was just saying it so you wouldn't feel like you were taking a handout.
Okay just chill out, I'll pay for it, you don't owe me, it's fine.
Got the Thai.
Did you mean to send me this text message? got this blond bimbo wrapped around my finger. another free dinner down the gizzard because I own house at fake crying?
Wow! Stop!
Mimes can't talk.
What?
So, why'd you yell at me still?
No noise!
Now you're starting to regret it?! Not when people threw coins at you on the subway? Or when Ricky called you into his office and said you have to take this job more seriously? How about when you spent 45 minutes outside in the snow because the secruity guard wouldn't let you into our building -- how did you feel then?
See, that's good. You don't say anything.
Exactly.
Completely silent.
You're peeping! You're talking right now.
I was giving you feedback. Just shhh.
That's good...
No. Just be quiet...
You know what?! Alright, you really suck at this! Why don't you just go wash the face paint off!
Wow. You shouldn't have spray painted your face -- how did you do your lips?
Oh my God...
No it doesn't.
If you ever want to see your friend Amir again, you will give me three zillion dollars.
I could see you hiding under your desk. There were a lot of typos in there by the way
You couldn't find an N or an O?
There's no E in your by the way.
You're mixing up that metaphor. Why do you have a "Guns and Ammo" magazine?
Is that real?
That makes me real nervous man.
I don't have a gut hole.
Easy! Don't point that thing at me!
Please put that down.
No.
NO.
Okay I trust you all right. Put it down.
I do trust you!
Yes! I don't know! Yes.
I don't know okay!
Stop! Stop, stop, stop, stop! I do trust you, all right?
I don't wanna do that man!
I can't!
I can't dude!
I can't do it!
No.
These are all fine.
You just smell really really awful right now.
So this was a very very thoughtful thing for you to do, thank you.
E-mailing me, calling me, texting me...
So both waters are for you?
Okay look!  I really appreciate your noble intentions here but you smell like shit and you're freaking me out with the excessive pictures of me.  So I'd like you to go away.
It's coming from your mouth so don't talk at me like that.
Take them with you.
Take them all! Alright?  Take 'em all.
You have to stop talking so close to my face alright?  You smell like absolute shit.
What did you eat by the way?
Hey everybody, we just wanted to say thank you so much for being a fan of Jake and Amir on Facebook. We just got to-  Wake up.  - 150,000 Facebook fans, which is--
Why do you just know that off the top of your head?
I bet you dont know.
Right, you dont.
OK, just say thank you, all right?
He- How do you- Why would you think hes stealing our fans?
Stop recording, please.
Hey, you're sweating a lot
Shh
Not work
That's not a good thing
'Siggestion box', actually
You know, you spend a lot of time at work being unproductive and just generally doing things that aren't your job
I said everything I wanted to say
Here something to consider
You are not going to-
You are not going to-
You are not going to like what people have to say about you ok? You don't take constructive criticism well
You know, anybody could say something like that and put it in the box
Stop saying poison
Then it wouldn't be a suggestion
Then it wouldn't be a tip. I think you've lost, you've lost track of the concept here
You are not my friend
How would that change anything?
Ok, you have gone of the rails now. At least you've started from a logical place thinking that a suggestion box could better helping yourself, but now you are speaking half metaphores which you don't entirely unders--
How long is your arm?
What?
Boo-yah!  Ha-haa!
Whoah!
That's right, it's your birthday!
That is awesome, yeah. Of course that is yours, and I shall leave it with you, namaste!
Paid for, in full, by me, for you.
All I want in return is a high five.
This is mine now.
What?  I try to give you a golden gift, and you spit in my face? You gotta learn how to be gracious, man, that was just rude. I'm taking this back to the store tomorrow.
WHOA! Are you nucking futs? I try to give you a golden gift and you sock me in the face. How's that for fair?
Are you nucking futs, Rosie? Are you a nucking futcase? Hey, here's a question: if I bought this gift for myself, why'd I do this?
How's that for overreacting, bitch?!
Yep, that's H-U-R-W-I-T-Z, and the iPad was broken.
Well it's under warranty so I'll tell you exactly what happened. I broke it over my friggin knee, and then I stomped it, with my friggin boot!
Yeah I activated the warranty, they do that for you.. automatically in the store, alright, sister?
Ok.
Wow, alright. Then I'll do it now. Then I'll activate the warranty now.
You gotta-- you gotta learn how to be funny, man.  I expect a full refund. You gotta be nucking futs!
Hey you're watching-
Why?
I don't want to get involved.
I told you that in confidence... Bitch!
Good night, man.
Terrible.
Right.
It's a chicken caesar salad wrap.
On a lettuce farm?
I doubt that.
I said I doubt that they can grow lettuce on the back of human mice.
I have half an hour for lunch every day, man...
You're an idiot.
Meaning?
I'm sitting.
Why do you come to work?
You do know that's not a riddle right?
Tomatoes are the size of apples.
You're not smart, man, alright...
Yes.
That one just sounds like you had a bad arts and crafts accident, alright. Why did you have to glue his card shut in the first place?
You eat meat! Ok you eat chicken McNuggets constantly--
You're eating one right now.
Well you told me it was oocytes fert--
OO--
...
Plank.
Oh god...well, should I come home?...Yeah, Just keep me posted.
No, Man, my cat's sick.
We have to put her to sleep.
It's whatever, it's stupid, I dunno.
Man, I've had that cat since I was twelve.
Okay, well, I've had the vest forever, alright?
No.
Stop noticing the vest!
Okay, well, I had nothing else to wear, alright?  How's that for an excuse?  I was doing laundry today.  Laundry day ha... Man, I remember when I first picked up the cat from the cat store...
Okay, well, it's a joke.  The vest is a funny joke.
I don't care what I look like!  I don't give a crud what I wear.
We're putting my childhood pet to sleep and all you can focus on is my cool vest.
Sorry, stylish.
Okay, well, it doesn't matter 'cause it's comin' off!
No, there's no-there's not watch-head on it so it's just like a band.
Oh my god it's so hard to put a band around your wrist and snap it in.
Lots of effort to take a quick bus ride over the GW bridge and you thumb it down  to an Abercromie.  What's hard about that?  And guess what, I didn't pay a friggin' dime 'cause I ganked it!  Ah ha.    Oh, one second.    Hello?...No, there's nothing you can do.  Why could-how-you already couldn't do anything...I understand.
No, it was Urban Outfitters.  My custom J-Witz dog tags aren't gonna be ready 'till late this afternoon.
Yeah, dog tags, like this one.
Yeah, well you need two!  Or was Justin Timberlake at the 2002 Kid's Choice Awards NOT styling?
Oh, yeah,  I bet he wasn't fucking Britney Spears.
YOU NEED FOUR!  Alright?  Or was Chris Kirkpatrick at the 2008 NOT styling?
Where are you going?
Woah..
Are you Rick Fox?
Sorry, what is Rick Fox doing here?
Yeah, I think I missed the whole egg thing...
Your bookie?
How gauranteed?
Stop, how much money have you made so far?
What have you bet money on
Good work
Yeah, there wasn't an Olympics in 2001
Yeah, you already made that joke
Really, why?
Eggs?
It's an eagle on my shirt. Okay, you're obsessed with eggs, sir
38 takes but we got there.
You have a phone.
That's not an upgrade.
Use your desk phone!
Alright, just don't cry!  God, here.
You cry to get your way like a four-year-old, that's so pathetic. That is ridiculous.
Where did you get that beeper?
That's still getting it.
You're being really crass today. How did you get a beeper from a doctor's office?
That's a butter company.
Doesn't sound standard.
So that beeper was in your butt?
I mean it's already really long. If anything it should be shorter.
Okay, first issue. Uh, there are a lot of duplicates here, like the first nine say "Find treasure".
Either way, let's just get rid of all the items that repeat.
Whoa! Mean text from your dad.
You read #124 and tell me if it's something you really want to do.
I'm saying why'd you write cockmeat in the fir-
I'm saying why'd you wri-
No, 419 is what made me think of it because you wrote: "You don't owe the world a f***ing dime." That's not even a thing you can do, alright? That's just a mean idea to have.
dictionary.com?
A lot of these are really conflicting.
Okay, 91: Write a novel.
#92: Set fire to a small, independently owned bookstore. Don't look back.
#93: Don't ever look back.
94: Give one glance, to make sure it's really happening. This is your moment. #95: Soak it in, you've earned one glance. #96: F*** it! Turn around fully and behold. You've earned this. Months of planning. It's all happening. Feel the warmth. 97: Tweet the picture, you've earned one tweet. Tweet a picture of you next to the fire holding up a shocker. Defiant and proud. This is your moment.
Write another novel.
This one's kinda nice. Climb to the top of the Eiffel Tower.
Start punching French women until their mustaches fall off.
Put a cherry bomb in a mailbox?
Yeah, you said it like a minute ago and it didn't make sense. Maybe that's like an excuse that worked once before and you keep using it?
Gotcha...
Your last page is just an index.
Okay, but you filed them all under-
Ss- I'm talking. You filed them all under miscellaneous except for #99, which you filed under odds and ends.
It's down here at the bottom, just chill out. I got it, okay? You- you said 99: Perfect! Why did you look back? Everything was going perfect. The bookstore was en fuego-
I know. Stop touching it, alright?
You were golden and you looked back. You made this about you. You're weak.
And this is what I can only imagine is a crude drawing of a-
Cockmeat sandwich.
Stop touching it.
You drew a cockmeat sandwich.
Naw man I'm working.
So, an hour and a half before works over.
That has no bearing.
I'm working.
Nope, still am.
Why don't you just go, I'll meet up with you later.
I'm going to get a glass of water.
Okay, unlock that right now.
You're holding the key.
What're you trying to do.
Who're you talking to?

Hello, Jake speaking.
You know what, fine Amir, I'll go.
You know what, I'm going to stay at work.
Hey Im Jake and this is Amir.
I already introduced you.
We have some bad news.
I havent even said what it is yet.
Anyway, in general people are getting together less.
They have less time for each other, they talk less, they get easily distracted by  see, this is what Im talking about.
If she lives eight hours away then shes not your neighbour.
Anyway, weve been sent on a mission by these guys to help bring people together
What did you expect people to do?
Well, it is exciting. All across the country were going to be helping you, all of you, get together. Parks, bars, in the streets
Not hot tubs, ok. Stop suggesting hot tubs. So that is our mission from Bacardi to help America get together which is why we bring you Jake and Amirs get together project.
What is in this?
Yes its specifically because of the pennies.
What's happening?
No, like why did you have that map made?
I specifically told you not to have anybody make a map. I said it would be too expensive.
And those fourteen water coolers I passed in the kitchen?
Those were also yours?
Stop saying fricking.
Thank you.
That's enough.
Yeah, that's good.
OK, enough about the shirt! But I do like what you're doing here.
Yeah, you're making an effort, right? That's what it's all about.
Not a time.
Wow. A soothsayer, right over there?
That's going to happen every hour?
That sounds like that might be a little too much.
Yeah, I think we're good.
Not too bad man, not at all. You know what? I'm going to tell you where I bought this shirt.
OK, don't do that.
I told you not to talk to me for the rest of the day.
Do you still do that thing where you enter the elevator backwards?--
Alright well people don't wanna look at each other in elevators; it's sort of uncomfortable.
Something about the weather?
Like, telescopic, noodley arms?
Giant noodle arms.
Or what was the other one? Eight legs?
Wow. Yeah.. that's stupid.
I said stupid.
Look, I said it was a stupid question, not in intelligent question; you're taking what I'm saying and turning it around--
How was the reaction?
Do you know what muted means?
You trying to do a stand up act, or something?
Join our Get Together Project at Facebook.com/BACARDI
AhhI dunno.
That's what you usually do anyway.
You see what you're doing now?
Outta time.
I don't like it.
Is it the voice?
It's not.
It's neither. God, you look really weird when you talk like that, too.
That's not natural.  You make this face, how is this is a natural thing?
Thanks.
Yeah! Yes. A million times yes, okay? This is mine now.
Beg all you want, ok? You don't get a voice this chill and just give it up.
Don't be a baby, dude. You're acting like I'm telling you to stop doing the voice. We can both do it.
Let them think what they want!
I'm not gonna get down there like a fucking dog--
Yes, like a dog!
Not gonna get down in the ground like a goddamn puppy to clarify for people, alright? Let them think that you stole it. It's honestly better for me.
Listen man, I know. I'll be the first to admit it's a dick move.
No, it's a dick move. I'm well aware of that.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, But what would you do in my position, if you had a voice this chill?
Obviously.
No. No. You're saying that because that's what you want. Not 'cause that's what you'd do in my position. Ok? You gotta learn how to empathize man.
Don't, don't. Come on, that's not even crying.
What? Yeah, I can lose the voice and then pick it back up. Doesn't mean shit.
Oh, I'm doing it right because this is my voice and you stole it from me. Ok? My voice rules, your voice drools, how's that for fair?
Uhm, no slit bitch. I know, I like my regular voice just fine, thank you.
I reserve the right to take it back, okay? Pending a second opinion. No offense, Pat, but you're a little bit of bitch, too.
You're watching Jake and Amir!
Not how that joke works.
Hey, hey. I just got this e-mail that you sent to the entire company and, um, nobody's going to believe you're doing a triathlon for charity.
Right, so they're not going to donate any money to you.
For starters, you began the e-mail by saying Dear Suckers.
So, that makes even less sense than I originally thought. Secondly, triathlons are running, swimming and biking, not drinking, fucking and stealing ya'lls cash.
That's not a response to what I just said.
Look, even if they get past the beginning of this e-mail, the next part is a picture of you in a jewelry store, holding a diamond watch, with the caption: I want dis.
That's the only thing I understand.
I just got a follow-up e-mail: It's come to my attention that you guys think this is a bogus goof. I legit want/need dis watch. Blew your cover there. Then, three follow up e-mails that say: Please disregard, please disregard, please disregard. One more, though. Just one sentence long and it says: Come on, douches. Help out the cause. And it's a photo shopped picture of you shitting on Bill Cosby.
That was a Jello pudding snack, ok. It's kinda weird, though, that you have a legit picture of you taking a shit.
Final e-mail: Please recall all e-mails. Somebody's being a bitch. And it's a photo shopped picture of Bill Cosby shitting on me, which is extra weird because you somehow got a photo of Bill Cosby taking a shit?
How are you so fast at photo shop?
Not very crudely. They're fine lines.
You gotta stop it with that impression.
Do I do that?
One last thing, alright? One final thing. Your shirt is up around your nipples. Pull it all the way down when you put it on. Alright?
You get it over your head. Your arms are through the holes. That's good. Put it all the way down.
It's not..it's still...it's half-way!
Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir.
Leave, man.
Hey, um...
a lot of people have been complaining to me.
I haven't said what it is yet.
Wow. They might.
It's about your stench.
No, not a lack thereof, exactly what I said. Okay? You reek of shit.
I'm not jealous. Look, this isn't going away, alright? You smell like you're dead.
That's not good enough, then. We all want the exact opposite.
First of all you didn't, second of all we don't want your apology, we want you to take a shower.
Is it really? Because last week a bunch of people chased you with a hose and soap.
Why would that be a goof? You whispered something to Sarah and she got an ear infection.
I know you don't. Don't do that.
No! No! Not anyhoot, okay? You have to go change your pants now.
You leaked shit into your khakis.
No. I haven't ever heard of  sharting your pants, with wet diarrhea, and then waiting a full five hours to clean it up, okay? That is the first time I've ever heard of that.
You're not gonna f*** anybody. It looks like you sat on a water balloon filled with chili.
Oh my god, it smells like gasoline and fish.
Hey, you're watching Jake and-
What?
Oh
I heard you rehearsing that line for a full five minutes outside the door.
I'm the organiser.
Hey!
In accent I'm the one fighting here, not you, not you and not you.
Well, that was it.
You're saying so many dumb things at once, it's crazy.
You know you said that already.
You actually did say it the exact same way.
In accent I want Dickie and I want you Charlie.
You didn't say it was fine, you said it was shitty so I did it again.
Hey, man alright it's funny just please don't say it anymore. Fine you do it, you're so good, you do it.
Hah! Bull Spit, that was terrible. Take the hand... In accent I'm the one fighting here, not you, not you and not you-
Alright, fine. How about this for a fighter impression, I punch you in the head!
That's not something you should want to happen.
Okay, why don't you just go on a booze cruise by yourself.
Wow, long e-mail. Can you hold your phone steady?
You're scrolling too fast. Alright, this is a small thing to bring up I know but I've never seen your phone with more than 8% battery.
That's not enough.
How do you think normal chargers work?
Done! You?
You're not almost done, you haven't circled one thing but you know what it doesn't matter cause I'm gonna win, not you, not you and not you.
Alright, fuck you man! Have you seen the movie? Have you even seen it?! Because I was at my cousin's bachelorette party right and I was doing the impression non-stop pretty much and everybody there was drunk yeah but they told me it was deec.
I need Dickie and I need you Okeef.
Fuck pretty good man! Last week you told me it was great!
You should have said that the first time man.
Cool, good job.
You mean the one that I organized, that I set up?  Uh-oh, spaghetti sauce.  I did.
Oh, cuz everybody's gonna be all like oh wait, you collected all the money. Um. What's that about?, you know?  Haters gonna hate, players gonna play.
Go on, take the money and run.
Go on, take the money -   I forgot to send out the email. I did. But trust me, there's no trickery afoot.  I did not make sexual steals with that Oscars. That's a campaign promise.
Good, cuz I didn't. And i have the text to prove it.
My sister texted me congratulations AFTER she found out that I won the Oscar pool.  That's how you know my picks were locked in. Otherwise, why would she be proud of me?
What? A but? In your butt? Oh my goodness. Ah. Ah. Ah.
Here's a question, I won enough money last night to legit hire a hit man to kill you.  Is that scary?
Yeah, but I won second place too.
Yeah, and you said you weren't gonna be a little bitch today. But looks like everyone's breaking their promises left and right.  Okay, you owe me another 20 bucks, by the way.
Losing fee!
Yeah, to enter!  That's the entrance fee! You owe me a losing fee!
Don't cry. You're gonna owe me a 50 dollar bitch fee if you cry.
You be - ohmygod, you're being such a bitch.
Amir's crying cuz I futt-bucked  him at the Oscar pool.
On a scale of one to third?
You didn't. Okay? Sorry.
Oh, I uh...uh...uh...uh...CAME, in first, second AND turd. As in, you guys need to learn how to be funny.
Ok, sorry bro, I actually already spent it on these boots.
Namaste.
These boots are made for f**king.   That's just what they'll do.  One of these days these boots are gonna skeet  all over you, oh!
Fine
Hey, yo, yo homies! Can you keep it down? For a second?
It's fine, look I don't mind you guys been loud but you're being really crass.
You're not actually you're talking about aardvark semen being really cold.
Why do you believe him?
Look hoodie you're a pretty good rapper but neither of you guys are smart.
No.
Because it's not a battle, if I destroy you! Hoodie, a beat.
Yooooooo, hahahaha! Pleased to meet you bitch it's about to get real!
Yo fuck you dude, what you talking bout wallis?
Yeah, you know like the show? What you talking bout wilms?
Willy, whatever they say in the fucking show dude.
Willis nice you know it, that makes you cool.. not!
No I don't wanna win it like that, that's gonna make me feel worse okay please don't do that, don't pity me. Give me another beat.
We're going down down baby, low street in a range rover street sweeper aardvark cock ready to-
Yeah it's Nelly, and if I can sing the Nelly song then I'm as good of a rapper as he is.
I'm feeling real sick actually honestly that's probably why I was offbeat. I have a headache because you guys were rapping I hope you feel bad, I'm gonna go home, how much do you charge for lap lessons?
Rap lessons!
Oh I misspoke, hey you come into the office any other day of the week and he's the weird one!
You're watching Jake and Amir.
Not cool.
What?
What do you want?
So let me get this straight. You were cleaning out your desk, which judging by the shit-stained khakis that are still right there, you've never actually done. And you found an IOU for the exact amount of that blow your own glass studio that you just bought on eBay?
What is this?
You're never gonna get your shit together to actually set that up and learn how to blow you own glass. Okay, here's a tip, don't take up any hobbies until you've learned how to wash yourself.
You need a coal burning oven, by the way. If you want to blow you own glass you need to buy a coal burning oven.
With what?
Just try to get out of buying the glass studio.
Mickey he's lying to you!
A new song? What's your old song?
That's awful.
Yeah, well I wrote it! I gave him the chorus, which I know is your favorite part!
You're gonna say I didn't write that? How about this, I would love to make you a vase. I'll cut you an 1875 cheque right now if you give me one guitar lesson.
I was getting it! It's my song! It's my song, I don't have to listen to you do it!
Why are you crying?
Ok, man...
Enough with the Charlie Sheen stuff.
What friends?
At least get it right.
Where did you go to school?
No...--
You're not.
Don't force it.
I know!
Don't cry!..
Why do you tell jokes?
I did know that.
Thank you.
I said thank you!
I can't tell if you're actually sad or if you're trying to think of another joke.
Why do you have them in your final four?
You said PU and plugged your nose.
Hey, maybe don't submit a bracket this year. Just because every single year you--
I'm in the middle of telling you!
Every year, you call the organizer the night before the finals and you threaten to sue them for gambling if they don't give you your five dollars back.
Don't touch my leg.
Don't touch--  No. No!
Nope.
Ok, I'm sorry.
Oh! All over my shirt!
Hey hey!
You're watching Jake and Amir, and why are you calling me?
Nobody, he's here.
I didn't bring you here.
Come on
Most important rule when we're in there: If he asks you your name, don't hesitate.
No, you're not that good.
Alright, practice. What's your name?
See, this is a good example of stuttering, making up a name.
This is not good, Ok, think of a name before we go in, that's all I'm saying.
What is it?
Yeah?
Then you didn't just memorize it, Ok, look, if you need to, just use the name, Jim. Ok?
Alright, but just in case you can't think of something-
Alright, what's your name?
I just did. What is your name.
Jim!
Can we talk about what we came here to talk about?
Ok, just promise me one thing. Don't go rogue.
That's good, don't worry about it. Just don't stray. Ok?
That was bad.
Even worse, Ok, just stay on topic, is what I'm saying.
Don't go rogue!
You said you didn't even know what it meant!
Hey, hey, stop, look. If he blindly follows your instructions, just tell him to shower.
Ok, I'm gonna go.
We're locked in.

amir:
Ugh.
We're locked in.

INTRO
You've gotta learn how to do intros, man.
Do you have to pee right now? Ok, we've been in here a minute and it doesn't sound like you have to piss that bad.
I'm calm.
You're drinking water.
Ok, stop. You know what, don't drink your own- look, I have water.
You guys, they sent somebody up to unlock the door.
I didn't say that.
Nobody breathes like that.
You guys, what about Amir's stench?
When?
How does that help?!
It's on your hand, now!
We're not having a talent show.
Ha, ha, ha, well if that's what you guys think then, uh,  screw you guys, I'm going home.
That's my impression, Ok? South park, Eric Carman?
Respect my authority!
Ok, I also do, uh,  his friend Kimmy!
Stam!
Kylee!
Mr. Spanky, the Christmas Shit!
Ok, you guys need to learn how to be funny,
Batman! Here we go.  Harvey Dept!
He's me too.
You guys better watch out for the Jokester!
Uh, Borat says what's you idea, you will?
Alright, screw you dude. Ok, I paid you good money and you went rogue.
Alright, the three Batmans have done it-
You just ruined it!
laughs Oh, that does make sense because the subway wasn't running today.
Yes! I remember you came up above ground finally and everyone was chanting Asshole!
Whoa...
Alright, that's sad, but I was talking about the makeup.
You're putting powder on your face.
Do you wash your face?
Then you do need to wash you-
That's the trick for girls. The trick for guys is just to never wear any makeup.
Sorry, your dad ganged up on you so hard that he moved?
How does this relate to oily skin?
Stand up!
Turn around!
Great! I just wanted to make sure I was getting fashion advice from the guy who shit his pants three weeks ago and has yet to clean them.
That's not- No! That doesn't fix it.
I didn't do that.
Moved?
Hey you're watching Jake and... Will you please start wearing pants to these.
Yo, what's going on?
I already know what you're gonna say.
Right, got it. Why are you paying these teenagers money?
Then they're teenagers.
They didn't lie to you okay, you misconstrued that.How do you know them?
How? They're half your age?
So you didn't talk for four years?
So it sounds like you didn't turn it on.
So you didn't talk for ten years?
Stop saying peep.
That's enough. I don't know what you guys are doing here but you all can just go home alright, peace out .
This isn't cool? Alright dude, I'll stop doing it.
They're tutoring you? Okay, yeah, and my shirts grey .
Its steel! Okay! Why don't I tutor you in having eyes.
Oh, they're tutoring you in math? Here's a pop quiz, eight times eight.
Woah, woah,woah, excuse me dude, eight squared? I said eight times eight!  Listen!
Who are you man? Alright look, either way he's not gonna get it.
Woah, woah, woah! Foul on the play! No doing that dude. You can't encourage him. He's got to do it himself.
Not with you guys smiling at him, believing in him, saying  Oh Amir, come on you can do it! You coddle him like a child. It's pathetic.
Bravo. Bravo. You guys tutored him to cheat, with a calculator under the desk.  AH! Oh, no. Ow! Okay, no calculator under there but ay, who left this desk here? Haha.  I'm gonna vomit.
You should lie up! Who are you!  I don't need a tutor to tell me...  I'm dying.
Right.
You just said two words.
Not a movie.
Film.
What film is 10 words long? .... 10th word. Fish?
Don't... ugh.. so you're surprised? You were going like this, it's clearly a fish. Alright, I give up...
Don't applaud... ok? He said it was ten.
What does that mean, man? Cooking on charades...
We wanna see you make your commute a wonderful thing.
Ok, fine, but it's going to be a book.
Come on, man.
Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir, but you should be studying.
Fine, but only because it sounds like it might be related to your job.    Okay, it's not.
What is this?
Geez...
Then it wasn't polarizing.
I hated that video.
Shhhh!  Calm down, okay?  You're yelling.
I can see the title, alright?  Just shh
I'm gonna go because you're screaming
Ah, ow!
Amir, Amir, you're hurting me.
You're hurting me.
Okay, just let go of me, okay?!    God, you're sweating so much right now!
It's cool, shut up  you're starting to
Chill out!
Chill out, okay?
You're-you just grabbed my chest!
You haven't even showed me the other one.
They're all uncomfortable to watch.
Who names your friends?  Trayson?
Oh!
Alright, just stop yelling, you're sweating!
Alright, hey, chill out, chill.  Who's gonna chill out?
Shut off your computer.
Shut it off.
Good boy.
Got to sleep.  Sleep.
Sleep.
...I hate you so much...
Nope. You missed it. You hit your glasses again.
Um. I don't know, man.
OK, Definitely not.
I di--I don't want to set you up with any of my friends, OK? Sorry.
All right.  I'm the girl.  Let's say we're on the date right now. Where have you taken me?
OK, you're trying too hard. Why don't you tell me about some of your hobbies.
That's sad.  Tell me about where you grew up.
Do you realize you haven't answered a single one of my questions?
So, the pink eye thing.  It's kind of a miracle the other 3 dates didn't get it.
All right, well like I said, I don't know anyone who would want to go out with you.
No.
I mean, I don't want to do this anymore.
I don't want to play this game!
We're not really breaking up.
First of all, thank you guys for donating.
Very cool, very cool indeed. So thank you again.
I feel like you're trying not to say thank you.
Hey, what are you doing?--
He does not speak for me!--
He doesn't speak for me.
Actually you said what's going on in Japan? Sorry, I DVR the news and I'm a year behind.
Well, they've already donated.
Ok but they have given; they gave; that's ok--
How much money did you give?
You're barely doing that.  You're doing a bad job.
Sorry, do you think we stopped making the charity video?
Ok you're pretty far behind in the news, huh? And sixty-one degrees IS pretty warm, for March, in New York--
Wow, you're further behind than I thought!
Where did I go wrong, she lost a friend, somewhere along in the bitterness, and I, would have stayed u--
Don't do that man, that really freaks me out, ok I'm Jake, you know that, right?--
Oh my God that's exactly what I'm talking about, it's really creepy.
Hey, you're watching Jake an-- Will you please start wearing pants to these?
...and I was like, I was so confused,  I was so pissed, and I called up customer service, and I was like, yo--
--OOH my God!  Rick Fox?
That's.. not funny! Ok? I'm covered in egg!
How is this fun? What are you even doing here?
I didn't know that; I thought you were his bookie.
You gotta stop it with the puns, I don't know who told you you were good--
So it sounds like you're still a bookie.
Just one share?
Stop! Stop.
I saw that.
Yes, I did, it looked like you got a c--
Then why are you being so defensive about it?
..No!..
We said no.
--Eggs?
HE'S the one that comes in here cracking eggs-- you know what, never mind.
Absolutely not.
He's not gone. He walked like two feet; he's behind that plant.
You know you're not doing that good a job of hiding.
At least move behind the main branch!
Okay.
He's not fine!
Not Spanish.
In high school, yeahyeah.
I had the peenie-- the teeniest tiny little thing.
Oh, man--
Hey, what's up, man?--
...I'm right here! You can see me, right?
Coo'.
Okay.
So I'll see you later!
Peace out.
My phone vibrated.
I dunno.
Alright, so--
Bad joke, see ya.
Alright, high school. Remember like the hottest girl. If you think about it now, she's like fifteen. Isn't that weird, that you were-- s- One second.  What's up, man? What are you doing?
You're just standing there!
Turn it!
One second.  Okay, what's going on, man?
Come on, we'll hang out later.
You're not going to have any fun, ok?
You really wanna hang out with me and my friends?
Just know that I don't want you there. Murph and Rosie don't want you there.  But if you really want to go over there you can.
Ok, even though none of us want you there.
Alright, fine, you can go sit down, but just kno--
There you go. Ok.  Amir's gonna hand out with us for a little bit.
But he has to leave soon, because he has to get back to work--
Talking about high school.
What's wrong with you?
Why would you tell the story like that?
Like it's this really funny story, but it turns out that it's this really really tragic incident?--
I'm right here! Ok you made my friends leave!
I'm gonna go.
Hey you're watching Jake and Amir
What?
I actually didn't know that, ok DON'T start a business; let's talk, we can invest the money.
Alright I'm actually no longer interested, thank you--
Before you get started, no ideas that have anything to do with stars.
No..
You mean dead people?
They actually don't.
Yeah, look at that, you just drew a picture of a cemetery with dollar signs all over it.
Yes.
Ok you just hit Caps Lock again and it all goes back to lowercase.
You know you don't have to make that face when you listen to people.
Nothing.
That's not a bad business idea.
Alright, I'm gonna pass because I assume the name is--
What?..
Ok it sounds illegal.
Alright, you can't cuss in jingles.--
Whoa, yeah!
Oh wow, more tombstones with dollar signs on 'em.
Alright what did I just say about cussing?
So it sounds like you know this is a bad idea.
Right, I just think this--
Then what are you singing right now--
Outta time
Yeah, ok? And just so you know, this is what it looks like when you fall asleep at work. And sorry in advance, but I'm tweeting it.
Hey, c'mon, don't look through my phone, man!
Oh wow, what!? How are you surprised at something you're not supposed to be seeing?
It's called I tried on one fedora at one store as a joke and my dumb godson saved it to my phone like 90 times.
Details Magazine says there's no cooler look than an opened up button-down, Hemp Sandals and a fedodo. Or was Jason Mraz in O2 not styling?
GQ says to get ready for the summer starting in February, that way I'm beach-ready and rock-steady and Dora like an Explora I'm rocking that fedora.
I'm saying: if this were a sit-up competition, you'd be the one that was embarrased right now, not the other way around.
I'm not gonna wear it to work, Yosemite Sam, abba-dee, abba-dee, abba-dee, I'll wear it to a club folks!
Oh my god, you don't get sarcasm. These pictures are a goof!
These pictures are of you!
Gimme my phone. That's right. Hey everybody, Amir spent every weekend for the last two months shopping for fedoras at every store he could find. J Crew, Hollister, HM, Abercrombie, Forever 21. Where else did I go? Did he go! Pacsun. C'mon, c'mon! See these embarassing pics before I tag them on Facebook.
Hashtag: douchebag! By the Seashore.
Here we go.
I was re-enacting it, dude. You gotta learn how to be funny. These pictures are of you!
Hey, who's chicaqueenvixenstyle.tumblr.com?
I already know it's you.
I know.
You don't. You sign every single post Amir Valerie Blumenfeld.
Really bad slogan, dude.
It's everywhere on the front page. Like a lot.
Don't say barely, you're scrolling right now.  Look, I can see you counting, if you're counting then it's too many.
These sex tips are like, really out there.
This one says put a  on it  until he bleeds.
That's not true.
That doesn't make it a fact, man. I think you confuse them with penguins because right here you wrote, in all caps, penguins eat their husbands.
If it's about praying mantises, I don't want to know.  So it was.
That's not what I said. If you're going to mock me, at least listen to what--
You know, I'm also realizing that a lot of your tips of the day are really mean, the same thing, and not tips. Like this one says 'my blog is the one stop shop for mom and pop, but don't bring your dad around here. This ain't no place for dads.'
All your other tips say 'long hair makes you look like a horse'!
Delete your blog.
It's delete the whole thing.
I guess the slogan. OK? It's kind of redundant to say 'dont' bring your dad around here' and then also say 'this ain't no place for dads'.
Ooo, you can't snap.
Who agreed with that?
Your friends have the stupidest names I've ever heard--
You know, I was thinking more about your fashion blog, and maybe I could help you out by writing a column.  Maybe then people will go to it. It'll be like J-Witz talking about fedo-do's, leather bands, vests . . .
OK, WELL I'M NOT DONE TALKING!  . . . vests.
Numeric page?
Sorry, man, I wan't listening.
I did hear you cut your finger. I told you to be careful.
I did, yes I did, I actually did.
I just caught a glimpse of that cut, man, and that's really bad.
The tip of your thumb is just dangling.
Wow, that's not good enough, O.K., you can't just lick it like you're eating barbecue ribs, you have to go to the E.R.
Alright, number one, why are you selling knives? O.K., you have a job, and number two, where did you get carobs and figs? And number three, you don't have a thumb. Go to the hospital.
Put pressure on the wound!
Stop flipping this around, O.K., you're losing a lot of blood.
O.K., how much- how much are the knives?
Don't try the stupid sales trick on me, O.K., I'll give you a hundred dollars if you'll just go take care of yourself.
What is going on?
You were just trying to sell them to me!
Hi, 9-1-1? Yes, I need an ambulance.
Right, my coworker-
cut off his thumb. Amir, what blood type are you?
She hung up.
Hey, ahh!
That's a newspaper not a script.
Yeah
Right, that's not true, I said I was on it.
Just, what's your point?
Meaning?
Just type it all up in an email and send it to me.
Sometimes I see your facebook password as you status message.
Don't yell at me like that's not an answer to your question.
Your pics?  You have one facebook album titled 'Another Day at the Races' and there's only one photo in here and it appears to be you at a dog pound bottomless with peanut butter all over your flaccid penis, you're surrounded by ten puppies and each one of them is ignoring you.
You need to delete it from the internet entirely.  Ok, you're wearing a shirt that's like eight sizes too big and it reads 'don't be offended if you're a dog lover - so am I' and the caption of the photo is 'who wants to see me get my D wet' subcaption 'you're gay if you click this' subcaption 'delete' subcaption -
Don't make fun of me here, ok?!  You're the idiot.  Subcaption: your facebook password.
How about this?  Just calm down, let's calm down.  Look at the groups you're a member of.
'One million strong against the new facebook,'  '10 million strong against the facebook redesign,' '100 million to say that Facebook is spying on us,' 'Amir Blumenfelds of the world unite.'  This last one, 'If one billion people join this group I'll slam my nuts in the door.'  All of them you're the only member, and this last one you uploaded the video...  It's you slamming your nuts in the door!  Why would you do that before anybody joined?
So you actually just went and slammed your nuts in the door?!
It has three views!
Did you walk to work today?
It's 28 degrees outside.
Your legs turned purple.
To take you to a hospital?-
Yeah, I don't want to do that man.
No, I'm afraid I'm not gonna get any work done to-
Yeah, I'm not worried about that. What was the time, by the way?
That's a pretty bad idea and it's a bad time.
I could beat that time.
Oww. Time out.
It's against the rules to not tell me the rules before I start running. That's probably why I busted my shin dude.
I'm taking a minute off the final time I'm sorry. Alright you ready?
Go!
Whew. Time?
Yeah, that would've taken forever. What was my time?
I don't need math, dude. Not when I'm this athletic. Give me some ice though, my shin is starting to swell right the heck up.
Look man, give me the ice. My shin is starting to turn not-a-good color.
Worse, green.
That's not brownies.
Exactly.
Number one, you didn't bake anything, you made batter. And you didn't  do that good of a job.
Number two, it's not a good way to meet co-workers. Alright, you look  desperate. You look needy.
For desperate that's pretty good.
I don't know. Why don't you just try talking to people?
If you don't want to talk to people, then why make the treats to begin with?
I's not. Look if wanna make friends at work don't just sit at your desk trying to buy their affection. Get up, have conversations, and be friendly.
So you're not gonna do it?
Join our get together project at facebook.com/bacardi
Who?
You just told me not to guess.
it's the same thing.
It's at least close... Steve.
I don't know, a guy who works here, maybe?
Honestly, man? I was bluffing. I don't know anyone's name either.
Oh, you like literally ran into him.
Why?
That's not what I asked.
Wow.
It's Jake, you say it all the time.
I know what a party is. You should leave work before you ge -
We're supposed to already know everybody's names.
You really might be in trouble. What was your idea by the way, you haven't said anything.
Gotcha.
Good for you. Alright, now I have an idea.
Welcome to our nametag get together... Martin!
...OK, anyway you're watching Jake and Amir.
Right, but you yelled Stay at home mom and you were talking to my mom.
What?
Doobs?
And the nickname you gave him to make fun of him was Doobs?
What's he doing here?
We heard your name.
Wow, did you book it?
So you do now right now. Why did you come here?
As what? A failed actor?
wait, why are you taking his side now?
That's your dick!
How?
Why are you so jealous of him? You have a good job.
You've auditioned for many musicals.
Penis, what did you auditioned for?
OK you know what? Maybe you guys don't hate each other because you are so different, but you, in fact, hate each other because you're actually really...
OK, alright...
You're watching Jake and Amir--
Yeah, you ruined it.
This is what money is. This is money now. FUUDge that!
You look tired.
I just did.
So you didn't learn anything.
I'd like to go back to work.
I shot you.
You're not even doing anything to try to disarm me--
AUGH! AAH! Oh my God!
Oh my God I'm gonna die now! You just killed me, dude!
You killed me, man...
Hey, can I ask you a question? Why are you always writing in your notebook and never on your computer?
That's not a question. Let me see your notebook.
What are you doing?  I ask and you throw over, you're an asshole.  OK, 'Dear Diary--
You write diary! You start every entry with 'dear diary'.
On who?? You wrote, 'dear diary, Jake hasn't complimented me in a million days' which sounds like an exaggeration because two days ago in a date marked October and 40th--
Nope. You wrote, 'Jake complimented me today.' Which I actually don't remember.
'once our eyes met, his smiled turned instantly into a scowl, but for that moment, he was all smiles and it was like a--
Dream'.
You count that as a compliment?
I thought it was a journal.
That's a scroll. Let me see your backpack.
Yeah. This is just filled with notebooks and scrolls.
Wow, please don't start saying that again.
You used to say it all the time.
What?
Yeah but it gets old and repetitive.
You have to change it up a little.
Wow, yeah, you wrote that in your diary.
No! This was on the scroll!
Oh my god.
Stick to the script!
Gotta stop saying that man, what happened to you?
Yeah, it looks like it did clip you.
So not right in the jugular, right? Why were you fighting a snake?
Sounds like you're the prick and the bitch because you're starving a snake. You're also the dumbass because you're dancing around a hungry snake with mice all over your body.
I wasn't saying that, but yeah, for the record I do think you're dumber than a snake.
He was laughing at you?
Was it a snake or your snake?
No it turns out you couldn't, cause remember it clipped you? This morning? Like six times?
OK you shouldn't own pets man, you can barely keep yourself alive.
What happened to them?
I can't hear you.
Can't hear you.
You're not deaf!
You keep it in your backpack?
You're
Jake
That was your cue!
We haven't gotten anywhere yet.
Alive! Alive, right? Don't do it. But if you do: Alive.
Will you please not snap at Karen?
He just winked at me, but even if he didn't, I doubt he could have gotten a wall like that.
It doesn't sound good, Mark.
We know how.
I'll take care of the music.
You couldn't freestyle for like ten seconds just now--
Those sound like two different things! I'll get a DJ, okay?
Hey!
Come on, Mark!
Karen! Karen! Karen!
Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir.
What?
It's 4:50, and you just showed up for the first time.
No, you don't.
Whose dad?
You're a bad person.
Why the air quotes?
I know what stag is; you did air quotes over my boys.
Gotcha, so it sounds like you're going to prom completely alone.
Why milk?
Don't whisper to me, okay? I don't wanna know your secrets.
So you got your ass kicked by a bunch of highschoolers.
Okay, why the corsage?
The corsage?
I guess you could say this corsage is for an unfortunate kid who couldn't afford a gift for his date, and the only reason I'm in a tuxedo is because I rented a limo and I'm gonna take them to prom myself.
I didn't think so.
I know.
All right, dinner tonight?
Just you and me, dinner... skip the prom.
All right, great!
That's exactly what I'm trying to avoid.
Okay, well, if it's only planned out pretty much, then it's not too late.
Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir.
It's not.
You know what? You're right.
Okay.
This is really nice.
I'm saying it's really nice.
I won't.
Well I said I wan't going to. I'm not going to so don't tell me what the repercussions are 'cause they don't matter.
I don't need to know the repercussions.
Fine. Fine. Alright, why did you insist on telling me? You know, you ever think about this? Maybe you're ruining the moment by talking through it.
Alright.
It's too bright.
It's too bright. Okay, let's just enjoy this moment in silence.
I know, I was agreeing with you.
I'm not stealing it.  Agreed. I said that I agreed.
No. Alright?
Why do you want to see my phone?
Okay, well you came over here and you told me that taking pictures was bad, to stay in the moment.
Well use your own phone, okay, you followed me here, you followed-  I- I- Get off me! Ow, ow, ow, Amir, listen- Fine, take it! God, what are you-
Hey you're watching Jake and Amir.
I said watching.
You guys gotta learn how to be funny. You gotta learn how to be  funny.
Oh yeah!
Did the other driver need to learn how to be funny?
I asked if he was okay. I said, "is Pat okay?" and then you guys stared at me like I was Great Caesar's ghost.
But uhm Busted Tees.
I said it's great that his family is there. That's really important you know to be there for him but you can buy the funny shirt at Busted Tees and that's, we're done talking about it.  His life is hanging by a thread. Speaking of threads
That's one! Can I get another? Can I get another? To the highest bidder.
Not the time
Not the time. Not right now. Email me later about the shirts.
I hate to say this, honestly, but Amir's the only one not being a butt hound right now.
I am calm, all right. I'm pissed! Some drunk driving f-wad killed our friend.  Is he gonna be fine or what?
If he's not dead then why are we stressed out, okay?
Oh my God then I have the perfect thing for him.  It's called a t-shirt and you don't need legs to wear one.  All you need to do is...
HAHA don't. All right? You're not exactly great at bringing street cred to things.
No trust me man, I'd love to go home. I would love to. But then you guys would guaranteed stop talking about the shirts.
Don't pick that up man, we're in the middle of talking.
Oh my god you can call him back.  Does your phone have caller ID?
His doesn't. All right, look, don't pick that up 'cause you're about to be a douche...
Bag! Ballsy move.
Well lah de fricken
I was hit by a bus this morning and you guys haven't said anything, all right? Sorry I'm not a poondoggle about it.
Hey, you're watching Jake and Ami- Ow! You stabbed me!
Yeah!
So I read it.
It's over 400 pages.
-Which makes it longer.
Sounds like you still want to be talking then.
That you shouldn't write screenplays anymore.
I'm not going to give you one thing. You always want one thing.There are thousands of screenplay rules, right? And I can't imagine one of them that you didn't break.
Stop saying like you want one thing, like you only could've made one mistake. You made a lot of mistakes.
Okay, the first mistake you could've made: your title is F*ck It: I'm Going Fishing Instead.
Don't get defensive so early, okay? I mean, I read the whole thing, didn't I? And page 96 to 311 is one long, unbroken run-on sentence about how your main character, Brake Obama - a name I assume you spelled incorrectly-
I doubt it. About how Brake Obama either needs to show his birth certificate or resign as mayor.
Okay, that's true.
Another thing: all of your scene headings say Interior: I don't give a flaming fuck.
Norton.
You know, I don't even think you need an actor because there's only one line of dialogue. It comes on page 299, and I think it's a typo because the main character says, Interior: I don't give a flaming fuck.
Okay, how about this: I'll shred the entire thing and as a favor to you, I will never bring it up again.
Okay, I'm not jealous, alright? I don't give a shit.
I would've loved at least an opportunity to make callbacks, to know I was seriously considered.
Oh, bullshit!
You dragged my ass in there as a dog and pony show, alright? You had Nort and I from day one and you put in there to light a fire under Nort's agent's ass. Well guess what?  Interior: I don't give a flaming fuck-
That was not bad! That was good! Nort's bad. Here we go, southern twang!  Interior-
I don't give a- Don't say No while I'm talking, okay? Let me finish! It's gonna sound bad if you say No while I'm trying to do it. Listen!  Interior: I don't give a flaming fuck.
Okay, open the door! He farted in the booth.
Do you want half of my sandwich?
Okay, well, don't ask me to eat lunch with you if you don't have any food, at all. I keep telling you--
Come on, did that really not look real?
A little more effort, right?
Why would we be laughing if that were the case?
There's an ice cream truck downstairs. We were gone for like, fifteen minutes.
So it was less than I thought. It's the first nice day of the year and - No! No. I don't have to justify this to you.
What are these?
You actually did forget; we were getting ice cream.  Dear Ricky, I don't value my job as much as I do that sweet, sweet cream.
No, he didn't respond. You emailed him again, and you said, Do you want your letter of resignation in a waffle cone or a waffle bowl, sir? Or is it easier if I just blend it up in a soy vanilla frappuccino?
Didn't write that.
Didn't write that.
No, that's when you finally got his auto-response. He's on vacation for the week, and you responded to that, What a quinky-doink, I'm also on vacation as I've mentally checked the f*ck out twelve minutes ago and went deep in that cream, cream county, and you know what? It is sweet. It tastes like never working in this town again.
You can't do that. It looks like you started back-tracking anyways, 'cause this email reads: Sir, forgive me for getting ice cream, I value this job.
No, it doesn't, it looks like you come clean in the next email; you write, You've just been had, this was an Amir Blumenfeld prank-duction. You shoulda seen the look on your face.
You didn't write that.
Okay, well I'm just saying you didn't add it. Okay, well you went on; you said, Please, please, please open up Photobooth and take a picture of your mug right now and send it to me, and I wanna see what a legit dildo baggins you must look alike, sir.
So it looks like you didn't just think of the dildo baggins-
Where are you going?
So it sounds like you're still going to be indoors.
Hey everybody, we just wanted to say thank you very much for becoming a fan--
--of Jake and Amir on Facebook.
YOU hold on a second, it IS recording.
We just reached two hundred thousand Facebook fans, and were really excited, and really really grateful, so thank you.
Were recording, what do you think s--
Do you see this, this counter?--
Do you see the counter going up? What do you think that is?
Yes, its twenty-seven, twenty-eight, twenty-nine oclock, thirty oclock,--
This is my computer!
Yep.
OK, I'm going to work from home today.  If anybody needs me, I'm going to be on e-mail and Facebook chat.
OK, Emily it's nice to meet you and I'm sorry, no offense, but I just don't want to--
I was looking at you.
OK, well then she's not underage.
That's not what that means though.
Shut up! How do you have a nineteen year old daughter?
You know what? You're probably right. So I actually don't--
I thought we just agreed that we're going to--
--No!
Stop talking!
I don't want to know.
They cannot possibly allow a nine year old to donate sperm.
No! You know what? I'm not. And by the way, I just looked it up on my work calendar on my phone, it's not Bring-Your-Daughter-To-Work Day.
You don't care. You just called her a dumb-ass orphan to her face.
Again.
So how is she your daughter?
Gotcha, so she's not your daughter, she's a con-artist.
Yeah.
No, she doesn't.
You guys aren't brothers.
Why are you talking like that?
What are you talking about?
You hear his accent.
There's is no point, OK? You followed me here. I begged you to leave, you're not even a member.
No, I didn't.
I'm power-walking.  It's better for you.  Good for your core, and it burns more calories.
No, than sitting.
Looks like none of the effort, your legs are just split over the treadmill.
That's a hotdog.
Twelve miles per hour, huh? Slow down!
It's only 2 miles, but I usually do other stuff for cardio like kickboxing or zumba.
Kickboxing, I said.  Ooo...nut shot!
Yeah, well it's not that impressive because you're going really slow.
Shhh! Shhh!  You have to be quiet, OK?
Shut up. Amir, I'm stopping the machine--
I'm stopping the machine.
Is that soda?
What's in it?
No, thank you.
You know, I can tell you're not running.
Yup. A girl just came over here and said that if you're not going to use the treadmill then she wants to get on.
--to the raw.
Really high when you eat as many kielbasas as you do.
You gotta be quiet, dude.
Shh! Shh!
Shut up!
Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir.
On a computer.
Hey, I gotta run to a meeting -- saw that.
Yes. Pick up my lunch downstairs for me, okay? I'll owe you one.
Fine. I'll owe you a big one.
Yes. Just a favor.
I'm just going to get someone else to do it.
Me shall not owe ye anything. I'm doing it myself.
Wow. You shouldn't have picked a favor so similar to mine.
Which pretty much illustrates how unfair your favor is
Same as doggie style?
Which was incorrect, by the way.
Okay, I'm going to go to the meeting. Don't get my lunch. Okay?
Sorry. I'll ask him to leave.
He thinks the glass is a mirror.
It's not!
Stop!
Do you think that means hello...
...in some language or something.
Okay.
Man that's rough. If you ever need to talk to somebody...
What is happening right now?
Hey, Murph! Hey hey come on, man!
Jesus!
Okay yeah, he annoys all of us, but you don't have to hit him!
Hey, you okay?
You sure?
You wanna finish the dance?
You wanna finish your dance?
Okay, sorry, I'm just trying to cheer you up!
Hey! Look at me! Let's finish the dance, you and me.
Alright.
We're not!
Stop it with that voice. You know you're eating a sandwich right now, that has carbs.
Yeah a lot and you said you weren't eating any.
You're not eating around the carbs, you're eating a foot-long sub and it looks like it has french fries in it.
How do you have a bagel now?
It's 90 degrees out today.
You're eating so many carbs. Like everything you're putting into your mouth is a carb.
I have. I don't think you have. Cos you're not doing it right.
That's not how any diet works alright? Especially Atkins.
Oh wow, lot of rashes!
Wow.
Jesus Christ
So many rashes...
So that sounds like a lot of different rashes.
Look now you're binge eating man!
Well you look really upset.
Yeah well maybe you're allergic to some of the food that you're eating, ok.
So that wasn't a metaphor.
Syrup
Annoying! I know! But you were interrupting and that's my pet peeve.
You're watching Jake and Amir!  ...You're not gonna say anything?
Fine.
Hey, Lerona. It'sIt's been about a year since you were accidentally killed by the bus. You know, I'm technically still your boyfriend; I figured nobody else is gonna come
What are you doing here?
Why?
Yeah, I'm her soulmate.
Really, that's because there's a difference between being a soulmate and being pathetic.
Wow. Wow.
Really?
You went there. Okay!
Yeah, dick move! I wanna fight you now!
Okay, well, David actually wins so...
Let's do it!
Oh my god.
No, it didn't! You saw itYou felt that, right? You punched her in the stomach!
That's not how that works.
Only you're...
You know, I always thought Lerona had, like, the brightest eyes in the world, but, uh... turns out they were only second to yours.
She did! Yes, it was like all over there!
Yeah.
Dog food! Yes!
I swear to god I saw the bitch eat Kibbles 'n Bits once, I guess, as a reward for herself, all right?
She said it was a Fun Size Snickers, but I smelled it and I saw it!
Yes. Yes.
Lerona used to always say anyways.
Anyways.
It was like ants.
So annoying...
So annoying.
...Wow.
How did you know...?
No, whatI like dog food!
OW, dude!
Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir. Turn your cellphone off.
I know.
'Cuz I'm good at juggling now, Murph, alright? I'm just nervous.
Now I'm pissed. I'm obviously not going to be a good juggler if I'm pissed. Don't leave! Don't leave! Please don't leave. Here, I'll do it.
What are you talking about?
Sorry, why do you think you would be the one to interrogate Osama bin Laden?
He's dead.
How do you hear about this story and not know he was dead?
That's Boston.
Ok, so now you're talking about like a dream you had, did you pass out or something?
Alright, stop talking. You're saying, like a million different things at once and the only person who can juggle that many things at once is named yours truly.
Alright leave! Everybody just leave, leave, alright? I'll make a video of me juggling, but for now; screw you guys, you need to go home. Alright, Murph, you're lucky you're a bitch, that would've hit you square. You got your bitch shield up, dude.
Can I just do it myself?
You got your cyst drained!
Yeah, I know. I can see it from the front, so I was just kinda reminding you that you should get it drained.
So does your cyst.
Yeah.
Okay well I'm just saying not to ignore it.
How much was the headset?
You just asked me to talk to you about it. Okay, I'm making conversation about the headset.
You begged me repeatedly to talk to you about it. I don't know why you bought one because you never get calls.
That's what I said.
What are you talking about?
It's not called that. Don't say it's called this, like it's a thing other people do
Gotta change that ringtone.
Hang up man.
Stop saying snatch. Who just called you?
It actually is my bitchness because you're running a phone sex hotline at workand now my phone's ringing. Did you post my number
Okay well it's coming from an area code that I don't recognize.
Yeah.
Okay well, yeah, well I guess you spend a lot of time in New Jersey on the weekends.
Okay, well I'm going to know if you posted my number if I answer this and it's somebody that I don't know asking me what I'm
Hello?  Yeah. That guy's jerking off.
That's not what you were saying before man.
It was snatch.
That was it.
Snatch.
Got it.
New business card. Nice.
I know. I didn't think you're were carrying around--
--like some random business card.
OK, it's blank.
Not ye-
Don't get mad, you're getting really defensive really early on in this conversation.
Just chill out. It's not actually. It's pretty slow, it's--
I don't.
OK, well, yeah, I understand that you carry around a spritzer all the time but how is anybody else--
I'm in the middle of talking, don't say 'what' to interrupt me, OK? You're--
--you're getting, you're getting defensive. How is anybody else going to know to spray the card with water?
Yeah, that actually was tough. And by the way, nothing has appeared on the card yet.
I would have thought it was a waste if you got it for free.
I agree. It's weird that you know all that stuff--
OK.
Definitely not necessary.
Nothing showed up yet.
Try not shaking it.
All right. You're right. I'm sorry. Hey look, it just showed up.  Tweet at me bitches, you know a player when you see one.
Doesn't have your twitter name.
That's fine. That's good. That's cool. All right, good talk. What do you say we start the day, huh?
Let's do it.
Uh, it's still 9AM but . . . all right, good talk. Take it easy man.
Go to your desk, man.
Hey, really?
What's it say, man?
So what do you say? We'll get like a business lunch or something.
Okay, first things first: Take some shaving cream, put it in your hand.
That's good. Okay, so-
Alright, easy, easy.
I don't want you to shave a cat.
Hey, one last thing...
Would you at least consider shaving your nipples?
You don't just want to shave your soul patch, right?
Alright.
Hey, look, I'm being nice, okay? I'm teaching you to shave right now. And you're 28-years-old so you should know or your dad should've taught you.
Yeah, just cause the hair is so long
No, long, is what I was going to say.
That only.
Yup.
I really don't want you to shave a cat, okay?
It'd be harder with cat fur.
Don't be proud of your body, okay?
No.
I already said no, man. You don't have to specify.
I know.
Hey, I have a question, how do you get this nipple hair so soft?
Okay, just like that, slowly, carefully.
Okay, slowly, carefully.
You alright? Watch me do it.
Okay, just do me a favor? Keep your razor away from your face, watch how slow I'm going. Just like this.
Just like this. You put pressure on that.
Okay, tell me this goat isn't chief, and I'll shave it off right now.
Oh, you don't know jack! Shaving it.
I don't.
Thanks again for agreeing to do this.
You're the last person I wanted to ask, but the only guy I know who knows Hebrew.
Don't be honored, I was saying it to--
It's not an honor
Don't be.
You know what, forget it. I actually don't need you. I'll use an iPhone app or something, just get out of here.
Just don't be honored Okay, here she is.
Hello.
You don't have to translate that.
Please stop.
No no no no no, not you, him. Translate that.
She pretty much doesn't, okay? She stopped laughing.
It wasn't a joke.
No, no, you're beautiful. Tell her she's beautiful.
Okay, well just say it.
Why did I even invite you here then, okay? Just say that to her.
What did you say to her?
Just tell her that I want to take her out to dinner tonight.
Hey, dude?
Buddy, you're talking in English and you're not saying what I said! Alright? You're an asshole!
Don't say that to her.
No! No, look at me. No.
Hey!  What are you doing?  Hey, Rachel, wait.
Look, you're mad at me for all of the wrong reasons.
It was.
I'm still wearing the dog tags, alright? But you know what, I'm glad that this isn't gonna work out because fashion is the #1 most important thing in my life, and you don't got it.  So peace out.
It's a leather band, sister.
Is that funny?  Way to go man, you blew that for me, she's a Lesbian.
Both, to be honest.  Tell me, what do you think about
Then help me take it off!
Ya, cause it's small. I stole the belt off my sister's frickin' doll, dude.
Hey, um, dude. So my aunt got your 'stay sick' card.. I don't know how you even had that made.
Right, so my aunt is like very sick.
I don't know how you got her address, or even knew that she had a cold.
How do you hot box a bike?
That's such a random car..
Right, if the car is meaningless then how are there five more cars?
Black slim?!
Matter right? As long as you're smoking that sticky ass gaunge in a sticky ass bong then nothing can go wrong, the car doesn't mean anything.
Weed.
Stop writing letters to my aunt.
Hey guys, what's going on?
Come on, man.
Did you guy seriously get me the deluxe package??
That is me and Reddick Bowe in the boxing ring, for two days!  Woo!
You guys, can I just let you in on a little secret? Real fast. I honestly thought I heard you say you were getting me headphones and I ran to the bathroom and I cried my eyes out. I just wept openly because I was that pissed, I was like 'these chumps call themselves my friends and they're getting me a lame-ass birthday gift?'--
--no computer, no wine, no Espaa, and now here we are, I feel like an ass because you guys are obviously my best friends!
Yeah, for like a couple of minutes!
But we're fine now because I got what I want.  What smells like shit?
Jake and Amir.
Sorry-- just-- shut up. All of you just shut up.
You're an asshole.
I have this theory that you're, like, such a bad combination of mean-spirited and dumb that everything you do makes you an asshole.
Yes.
It's the first one.
It's the work one.
Bad. Wow, that was the word you were looking for? It was bad?
It is.
Thank you.
I'm so surprised at how many times I've had to tell you it's the first one.
Sorry--... who named you Lerrence?
You know, by nineteen, you really should've been pretty much raised.
And named.
Yeah, I think I'm gonna leave too, but, um... I'm not jealous.
Yeah, there's a crowd of people booing you guys outside.
You're watching Jake and Amir!
Just don't talk.
Yeah.
Oh, no...
Blood.
At least tell me you went to a real orthodontist.
Why?
Herself?
No, you didn't.
How?
How old is he?
That's cuz he's not.
Do you mean jaw?
What was wrong with your teeth, anyway?
So they weren't crooked, though.
Right. Since you were an infant?
Like a tab?
The tab.
Braces straighten your teeth. They don't whiten them.
You know?
You know. Okay, so why--
So why would you--
Your gums are bleeding, man.
Bleeding.
That looks like an intact cupcake, so you didn't eat it.
Wow, braces, fallin' off.
You're watching Jake and Amir!
Yes, necessarily.
Hey, hey, hey! What the fuck is this?
Is that actuallyoh my god. Are you fucking crazy? Are you actually batshit fucking crazy?
Why?
I've heard of it. You've done it before.
I have to burn my desk.
You poop it out because it's bad for you. It's waste. It's excrement. It's feces. Feces has diseasies.
Whoa, hey, look, just.. leave it alone. I'll find a way to deal with it, but you just don't touch
If you come near me with it, I'm gonna punch you in the face.
Amir, it is! It's human shit, all right? I feel like I'm dealing with a two-year-old.
OH, I hate you guys!  What the hell?!
Wait, what?
You said, And shit.
But itbut it smells and tastes like...
Not right!
It hasn't started yet.
Then don't.
Shhh...
Exactly.
No...
Wow, bad way to feel.
It's a girl.
You're even wrong when you're already wrong.
Don't e-mail that to yourself. Hey!
It's a musical.
Yes, it does!
It does.
Hey, can you not listen to your iPod?
Shhh, wow, please stop listening to music, okay?
Yeah, it sounds like a crazy person screaming into a microphone.
Then go to the bathroom.
Oh no...
Just watch the play.
Please stop. Please stop.
This isn't Grease.
Okay, great, just be quiet.
Thank you, just talk to me about it after the show. Please.
Wow, mean nickname.
Okay...
Stop.
Why encore?
You're watching
You're slowing us down.
You know I'm not here for the talent show, Man.
Nobody showed up, okay?  Be at peace with that.
If you're venting, I will stop and let ya vent
N-no, you're specifically to blame, just because the fliers that you put up where um at best blatantly racist and at worst...illegal.
Mostly about how appalled they were.  I mean, you wrote a 'w' on each one of your butt cheeks, bent over, and took an incredibly high res photo of your anus so it spelled "wow".
Not impressive.
Why did you build the entire thing as The World's First Non-Filipino Talent Show?
Did you not hear me or are you actually confused?
In every e-mail you sent out, every tweet ya tweeted, every Facebook message that you bombarded everyone in the office with, you said "The World's First  Non-Filipino Talent Show.
So you remember?
Why?  There's only one Filipino guy in our entire office.  Why would you call him out like that?  By the way, he's a really great juggler.
What were you gonna do?
That makes no sense.
Alright, I used to think you were like misunderstood, but deep down a good guy
Y'know, well let me finish
I appreciate that you appreciate it,
but I'm not done talking.
Okay, well, Ii just want you to know that I'm not trying to comfort you and I might actually insult you by the time I'm done talking.
You...
I don't think
You are not good!
Okay?
Okay, I'm-hey, no, look you're... Amir, you're not good, you're great, alright?  And I am here for the talent show.
Me and Ryan!  Ryan, get in here!
Look at this, this kid can juggle, boy outtie!
Okay, okay
Not that funny.
Go home!
It's 2 PM and you're coming in for the first time, and you're literally dripping with cologne.
I don't get that reference, man. I don't know what you did, but my eyes are watering.
Two spritzes.
It looks like you're wearing a cologne bib.
I want you to leave, okay? I have a headache.
So tend to it. Take a shower. Change your clothes. You know you smell awful, right?
Stop! That's so many spritzes.
Right, okay. Look man, stay calm, I'm calm.
I'm on your side-
Alright, let me talk-
I just have one piece-
of advice to tell-
Don't do this-
Okay?
Where did you even learn that technique.
Well let me finish talking.
Throw away your shirt!
Wow! That was f***ing fast!
How did that happen so quickly?
What are you doing?
What is that accent?!
No! Heey hey hey hey look.... Chill out! Chill out!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
Am I bleeding?
I'm fucking bleeding, man?
What are you talking about?
God, what is wrong with you?
Why are you in worse pain than I am? We're in the same pain!
WHY?
We're in the middle of a conversation man! Just listen to me! Why is shame worse?
I'M IN PAIN!
Well I'm in shock!
And I have confusion! I have betrayal!
HOW IS BETRAYAL SHOCK?
NO, THEY DON'T!
Ohh, I am bleeding dude! At least apologize!
I DON'T JUST HAVE SHOCK!
What changed? Why do you think I have no pain?
I have loss! Remember my cereal? And I feel damp, and uncomfortable, because I'm covered in milk, and blood!
OK now you're insulting me, so you're adding insult to injury, and correct me if I'm wrong but you don't seem to be in that much pain!
Get away from me man.
I don't.
Ok.
I don't.
I didn't say I couldn't, I said I don't want to.
Real quick, you gotta stop winking at me, alright?
Why are you signing up for all these classes?
Really thought that third thing was going to rhyme.
I did notice, I called you out on it. How much money have you spent on these "deals"?
Spent.
Oh my god, give me your credit card.
No it doesn't.
Bad math. Bad logic. Just cos you're saving money doesn't mean you're making money.
Yes.
Not your fault, man, that's a really hard slogan to remember.
Then it is your fault, you're right.
You must've said it once.
Ok, well chill out man, you're wasting a lot of money.
Hey, c'mon...
What are you doing?
I opened up. I confided in you.
And yeah. You're using it against me.
How's it make me feel?
Bad.
Like I don't want to tell you things.
Alright, well. Don't like get annoyed at me like I should stop lecturing you like you're - Are you still buying
You're not gonna remember the slogan, just don't try it.
Just drop it!
Hey, you're watching J--
Just leave!
I know!
You say that like it's a bad thing!
Where did you even come from?
That doesn't answer my question.
Wow, every single item of clothing is backwards today, huh?
Jesus!
Nasal scoliosis??
Nobody invited you into this room!
Oh, come on, girls, don't leave! We were having a nice little ladies' lunch!
No one was laughing, man, just you were laughing.
You clearly farted during the second "toot"!
No I heard that but you also definitely farted!
Yes--
--I can smell it too!
Stop denying it man, we can both smell it!
Ohh!
Oh, come on!
We were having such a nice ladies' lunch!
I was invited!
I was invited!
Oh my God.
I hate you!
What?
He's standing next to it.
Chill, why do you care?
So then you don't care.
Don't teach anybody a lesson, alright, you don't know reading.
Spell suitcase.
Wrong, wrong, you're wrong, you're so quickly wrong, you're wrong right off the bat don't fight me on it, Ok? Stop yelling.
About what, the spelling?
Ok, no, because none of the letters were correct, and also, you know, he's not being that reckless with his suitcase 'cause he's standing pretty close to it, in a building, with security, surrounded by regular, employed adults.
Great, you've stopped listening to me.
Bad joke-
Alright.
You know, you left your wallet, open, on your desk.
You have cash spilling out of the back of your jeans.
Just say our names!
Hey can you...
You have to develop film, you know?  You're destroying it.
You know what?  I don't, because I don't want a scrapbook.
You've called it a scrapbook, like, fifteen times since you got here.  Look at the cover.
That doesn't change what it says.
A couple more months then.
Let me see it.
Wow there are baby pictures in here
of both of us somehow
It is a big whoop, it's a huge whoop; you made us slow dancing.
Jesus, both of our families at Disney Land together?  Our dads are kissing!  Why would you do that?
You in high school with Dane Cook.
Why would you even want to include this in my scrapbook?
Don't narrate it, please.
Didn't have a QuinceaeraOh  I did.
Very nice.
In an airport.
Got it.
Hey, Man, bad news.
New rule: if I flip this next page, you're a nerd.
Yeah, I just have to flip this next page and you're a nerd.
But I really wanna see the other pictures.
It's worth it to me.
Hey, hey, hey
Oh god!  You're a nerd now!
Sorry that you're not You Photoshopped a vagina onto yourself and you're masturbating?

amir: So you're just done?
I'm done!
Whoa, bad!
Ohh, Whoa! Any idea why I went to the bathroom and I came back and have 31 emails?
No, I mean any idea why I got all these emails? Each one is a Facebook notification!
31 comments, all made in the last two and a half minutes, on a picture of us that you uploaded.
Got it, do any of these sound familiar?  "Really thinking about making this my Facebook profile pic, somebody please please talk me into it."
Sounds like you DO wanna do it, 'cause you respond to your own comment with, "Will somebody give me the confidence to make this my prof pic? Spiritually, I'm an ox , I'm ready to make the move. Emotionally, I'm nowhere near where I need to be."  Then you reply, again: I'm in tears , I'm a baby in each one of your arms, let me suckle on your tit and drink that sweet sweet confidence juice."  None of those words, not a single one, was spelled correctly!  You respond, AGAIN to your own comment, "You know what? Gotta trust your gut sometime, go fuck yourself society,  this picture is a huge middle finger pointed at each and every one of you,  and guess what? Don't worry 'cause that middle finger is up your ass and around the corner!"  Then society SHOULD worry....
Then you comment, ONE more time, "Didn't have el huevos to pull the trigger, wow I am a weak ass nerd!"
HOW are you this insecure?
Right, 'cause your current picture of Calvin pissing on a picture of A-Rod kissing Cameron Diaz at the Super Bowl is really popular.
STOP talking in that NASALLY, GRATING voice!
Alright, I feel myself getting angry and worked up, and my therapist says to not let this stuff affect me, so I'm just gonna unsubscribe from Facebook notifications, shut my eyes, and count to ten.... One....
....Two.... that is NOT a smart thing to say right now, but ha haa! I DON'T care! I'm smiling, my brain thinks I'm happy! I'm fine! Three four! Five...
.... Yeah! Usually people say something else after they say "rest assured," but I don't care! Not at all! Six! Seven, eight!
YES! THEY DO! OK, it's fine, it shouldn't DOESN'T bother me! Nine!
GLUE! YEAH! TEN! Great! OK, THIRTY ONE MORE EMAILS!
First comment, from YOU: "Shitty profile change!"
You're watching Jake and, wow, your nose is bleeding a lot.
No news.
What?
You said it was earned.
You just said the good news.
I care.
I didn't do anything.
I didn't write a letter!
I want to.
I didn't rent a giraffe.
I wanna tell him everything!
It sounds like i'm taking a hit on everything.
Take a hit on all the things!
It wasn't mine!
No, you are wrong, you said you were gonna take the hit on it.
You said both. You said the first duck thing, the high school track thing and the second duck thing.
Why am I getting a phone call?
I don't think so, it's a local number.
What did we actually do?
Awesome alright stop talking to me because I don't want to be implicated any more than I already am
Lemme guess, the duck thing.
So not very wrong.
I- what
You're mad at him! You're mad at him, not me! Hey I didn't do anything!
What is that?
Got it.
Alright, let me explain the economic crisis to you, so you don't embarrass yourself in another meeting.
You took out a hundred dollar bill, lit it on fire, and then tried to light a cigar with it; you failed, you burned yourself pretty badly, and you burned Karen really badly.
She was already upset because she lost half of her retirement fund in the last three months.
She didn't invest in cock futures, ok? nobody is inve.. What is a cock future?
Slow down or you weren't listening?
Well one implies you were giving some effort but I was just talking too fast, the other one is just that you're being an asshole Interrupted by Amir
So it was the second one?
You then rolled up a hundred dollar bill, shoved it in Karens ear and lit the tip of it on fire, screaming Enjoy this ear candle you dumb bitch, it's half the price of a cock future and unlike you it's guaranteed to blow smoke up my ass.
A lot of people tried to tackle you.
You think Obama would be the one to cut a check? Amir shrugs They needed more than a Trillion dollars.
A thousand billion
A thousand million, which is a thousand thousand, which is a thousand dollars, which is how much four chicken nuggets cost.
Where did you get that?
You can be a staunch Democrat
You do interrupt me a lot, not necessarily during my stand up
You're interrupting me right now
It's happening right now  , this is interruption!
I know, Chucky Cheese tokens instead of money, right, you said that maybe too much during the meeting.
Yes, I'm very ticklish but your hands are so cold, and wet and clammy that I'm just grossed out..
Yeah, like that feels like I'm being poked with cold crab claws.
You did not learn your lesson yet. That'll be 300$ on the day!
That's not smart.
Yes.
Right i did but...
Fine, where's your box?
So then from inside the meeting we heard you threaten to make your face red until you passed out, which I guess you did, because then nobody heard from you for 30 minutes.
Right, because you had stopped breathing.
Yes, on your end, but like for 30 minutes in real life.
Booyakasha?
Newspapers, alright, it's not hard to stay informed; you read an hour a day, New York Times, Wall Street Journal..
Daily show.. I watch the Colbert Report.
You're watching JaOW what was that?!
Oh, my eye!
Woah woah woah, hey! You guyswhat the hell are you guys doing?! Get out of here!  Those are Amir's, leave them
Hey, buddy. Take a walk with me.
No no no nodon't go over there.
It's about your lunch.
It's not there.
It's gone, alright. Somebody ate it.
I'm not trying to be funny, alright. It's not gonna be there.
Your lunch isn't there, man!
It's gone! Somebody ate it!
Amir, it's alright, look. We're gonna get you new nuggets, okay man? Get you some new nuggets.
It's not important who did it. Alright, just let them
I did it. It was me.
Hey. Look at me, don't do anything stupid, alright? Hey, man!
What are you doing?!
Was that worth it?
No, in reality.
What were you thinking?
hey, buddy..
What you're doing right now is worse than screaming
no, they're crying
They're not laughing so hard that they're crying, they're just crying, somebody died.
No, Kunal
Wow.
No.
Go back
Go back to the hospital.
That's not intelligent. Sounds like you have a lot of health issues.
Sounds like you're afraid of getting shots.
You're not intelligent. You have a lot of health issues and you're forgoing treatment.
That couldn't have
You're clearly
Was that happening at your hospital?
Why tack that on at the end of the sentence?
I was on board with the Get out of Jail Free tard, that was sorta clever.
But you didn't get out of jail for free.
Tell you what: I'm just gonna know everything you say from now on is gonna be for real.
Yeah, so don't say it anymore.
I'm not saying you should let somebody hack you up in a van.
Stop, I can already tell you're having Leron's friends operate on you.
Yeah I got
Time's up, you're not gonna bring the pun home.
You tried
I don't think it would have been funny even if you did nail it.
No, nailing it is like getting it right the first time.
So there's no way you could have nailed it.
What?
Oh my god.
It's for real. Yeah, okay.
You're bleeding from so many parts of your body.
Oh my god! No!
Hey, you're watching JakeI'm not ticklish, so stop.
That's you.
Hey. Hey. Hey!
Stop blending!
Nothing to yell over now, right?
Yeah, well, I want you to stop
Dude! Please!
What are you doing?
I've told you to shower, I've told you to stop being mean to children, I've asked you repeatedly to learn words like dollop and
Never, ever, have I ever mentioned a blender to you!
Cool!
You're blending again!
Why blending?
What's in there?
It's gross to all. I think I'm gonna puke.
Aw, come on.
Hey hey hey, look. If you have any respect for me, for yourself, you will not drink that.
You okay?
That was good?
You sure you're alright? You look a little
What?
Why would have kept drinking?!
You have to start learning words, man.
Okay, relax. I'm gonna induce vomiting. Okay?
I'm gonna come over there and stick my finger down your throat until you throw up.
Alright, here we go.  Let it up. Let it up, baby. Come on! Come on, you gotta let it up! Come
Then why would you let me do that?!
Aw, aw!
I didn't puyou just puked!
Say it!
Hey guys, cool news. Me and Amir came out with a thirty-minute special, which you can watch now on CollegeHumor or Facebook for only three bucks, or you can buy the DVD today, by going to CollegeHumor.com/JakeAndAmirFired.
That's not true.
When?!
Heyheyhey, don't touch me.  Cut.  Don't touch me, right?
Hey, Jon, can I see your frame?   You punch in, just a little bit?  Perfect, thank you.
It wasn't; he adjusted it; and now it is.
He's good at his job. Please just relax.
Most of all, we're excited for you guys, our fans, to see it. We really think you're gonna love it.
Why are you saying people hate it?
Right, I know.
Don't call him boy, alright? Let's just get started.
He is doing his job! You're not doing your job!
No, your job is to promote the special.
Stop saying ruckus--
It was a real group effort, and we're really proud of everybody that helped make it happen.
...It was.
YOU are holding up the process.--
So, download or-- Download- ths- ah, sorry.
Fine.
Relax, take a breath, no rush, you're fine; don't work yourself up. .
Wow--
You slow it down!--
Get the DVD today!
We're ne--
We'll d- use the play-- Don't touch me, I'm really s--
It is a mess-up!
You know, I only messed up once, so I don't feel very bad.--
This is insane! Rick Fox did this to me!
Somebody has to be able to hear me! This closet's really close to a lot of people!
Ahhh, your dick's small!
You're watching Jake and Amir.
Don't tickle me!
Hey, just got your Kickstarter email.
Okay, don't just repeat things that I say. It makes sense when I say them to you.
Kickstarter is meant for like meaningful projects, like albums or films.
You know that?
So you think the Amir Blumenfeld Foundation For Not Giving A Shit is a meaningful project?
No, it's not. Do you really expect people to donate?
I do see that--five dollars and you get a pin that says I'm Cheap James, bitch.
Yeah, I haven't. Ten dollars gets you a t-shirt which says I donated ten dollars to a fake charity and all I got was this lousy dick.
Sure, twenty dollars you get to punch somebody in the chest.
Which if they do, you get to punch them in the back of the head.
No!
What?
Excuse me?
I heard you say something.
This says that if I donate a hundred dollars you get to personally deliver me a bitch taco. What's a bitch taco?
I'm being a bitch.
Cool, you know what? It's people like you that ruin Kickstarter for real artists like me...and other people.
Good question. Check your email.
Ya, a coffee table book about my two passions.  Oh!
Streeter! No!
Hey, you're watching J--
We agreed I was gonna go!
Woo!
Holy shit you're a loser!
You not liking it validates it as a good idea!
Two studs for the price of gun! BING!  OW! F- Dammit, why would I flick it?!
They're still tender as the night and twice as gay-- NOT gay, not gay,, get with it, Hurwitz. I'm like, repeating that shit the dude yelled at me on the bus this morning.
Yelled at me, then like boxed my ears. Pretty much got a standing-O, forcing me off the bus. I was gonna walk home, but I was like fuck it, I'm afraid to be alone.
If you think they're fly now, come meet me at the club in six weeks.
Six weeks, that's when I get to upgrade the earrings. I'mma gauge this one out.. to five sixteenths, and on this one's gonna be a giant hoop all the way down to my fucking shoulder blade.
Write this down, baby! Spiderweb tat on my elbow, spiderweb tat on my elbow, spider tat on my abdomen, bicep tat of my astro sign, Leo DiCaprio--
--and guess what I'm doing with my lips? ......eatin a pussy.
Eating a pussy!
Not even including facial hair.
A goatee on top of my thoat-ee makes the girls say ay, papi! Aheh! I made out with my cousin! At a club!
Crimson.
The takeaway here is that I got into Crimson, on a Tuesday, the fourth hardest night to get into Crimson, not including the weekend.
Monday, yeah, but listen I've been rejected on a Monday. Alright you ever give a bouncer a hundred dollar bill up just to see him tear it up right in front of your crying eyes?
Trust fam, you ain't. Ok not a lot of people can handle the blinding pain, the crippling insecurity, the constant desire just to- you know what, fuck it! It's not worth it! It's not worth it! Help me get this off!
They are, ok! I'm just not ready for it!
What?
Too late, bitches! Unless you guys think it's cool...
Which is exactly why I didn't do it! Wow, that was hard!
On a Tuesday! On a Tuesday!
You're watching Jake and Amir.
No.
Alright, well, just-
Jesus Christ, man.  You've been missing for two days.  You can't just show up and say costume number one.
We thought you were dead.
I wouldn't worry about that.
We called your parents, who said good riddance.  I'm sorry that you had to hear that from me.
Do you think you're in a corn costume?
Where were you man?  For two days, you were just, you vanished.
You're NOT in a corn costume.
You changed out of the rooster costume?
Look in the mirror and tell me if you think you look scary.
Still no.
You're not corn, you're peas.
We've been planning your funeral for an hour.
Don't do this, cuz you know you're the Count!  You came in and said I vant to suck your chocolate.
Bad costume.
That's a dress.
Stand up.
Stop...dude...you have to rela-
You know you finally have it, and you just blew it.
Look in the mirror.  You're corn.
No, they're not.
...What?
Sure.
We're fine.
We're fine! You... You asked if we were okay, I said we're fine, now you wanna know if we're good.
Let's talk about this after work. Okay?
Cool.
All right.
I said, All right.
Oh my god, just say it  if you're gonna say something, say it.
We're cool, okay?
You're mad?
I said we'll talk about it after work.
What do you mean, When is after work? It's 6 PM! 6 PM! That's after work; there's no mystery here, okay? And don't accuse me of pushing it and pushing it and pushing it, 'cause this is the first time you've brought it up.
It does imply that.
I am talking to you.
I didn't say we were good. A minute ago, you asked me if we were okay, I said we were fine, and now you're demanding to know how good we are.
No.
Me too.
Okay, I was kidding too.
Yeah...
Hey... I wasn't kidding. Oh...
Okay...
A little too tight, right now, okay?
Yeah, I'm just saying it's a common courtesy and it's like hygienic so you should really do it.
Nothing. You know, I'm going to go home--
Chill out, OK?
Hey! Hey, wow, really quick to start offending people, right? Sorry, especially because you didn't even ask for a shot to begin with.
Sorry.
I'm just going to have an iced coffee. Thank you.
OK, she got two shots of espresso.
That's definitely going to put the edge on. You know, what are you even stressed about?
Do you owe them?
Yes, please.
Yeah, it's 9AM here.
He's going to break dance.
Can I have your number?
You're watching Jake and Amir.
God...
Don't feel bad, all right? Everyone's busy.
They're busy.
You interrupted their--
You are the only one that cries anything on this, and you showed up to work seven hours late today so maybe don't call Rosie out on being a bad employee.
Amir! You gotta drop it, okay! I realize what you're doing--You're trying to save face on this,  but that ship has sailed.
Bye.
No!
Hey there, everybody! We wanted to let you know that we are coming to Boston.
Don't touch me! And stop doing that. Tickets are on sale now for our show at the House of Blues in Boston, Massachusetts on Tuesday, November 15, at 8 PM.
Got traded, and is now retired.
So go to livenation.com, and get your tickets, come to the show, and it will be a lot of fun!
Was that who you've been talking about?
Hey you're watching Jake and Amir. MY GOD you smell
No, no way, there is no way
No, you can't tell the difference between a guy and a girl based on the way they clear their throat, that is such a random ability.
I do, yeah, I'll bet you a hundred dollars.
Okay. Vikram, Cassady, get over here.
Alright here we go, person 1, clear your throat.
Person 2
Yeah
Told you
HEY HEY, what the hell
That's not part of the bet, man!
Yeah we wouldn't have to because its not part of the bet.
Amir said he could tell the difference between a guy and a girl based on the way they clear their throat and -
But now you're trying to feel their hips.
Obviously not, get out of here dude you-
STOP!
Pat, no!
That's more than $100
Get off my neck!
Murph, my neck!
Murph!
STOP! STOP!
Hey, is match.com down for anybody else? Cos I'm 99% sure an uggo fuggo just tried to look at my profile... and I gotta troll her.
I have time for this.
Called me Jake for a second there.
Oh my god, me alone.
You're gonna edit this like I'm -
- aren't you?
I'm not wearing the -
oh... dude, what the f-
Did you change me?
You punched me in the face.
No, with your fists. You knocked me out.
Dude, did-did-did you steal my phone?
You stole my wallet and my phone, dude.
Alright, that's it.
Hey Amir, I'm sorry.
Jocelyn, I'm sorry.
Ok, I lost my cool, ok? Any way I can make it up to you?
Oh my god, don't sound like you're crying all the time, Jesus.
Houston, we have a problem! These shirts are too fat.
These shirts are so hot, they're practically on fire.
You're - amazing. You're fu- amazing. And you know what else man? This shirt, it's - amazing. You know who's going to buy one of these? - Everybody. - You got that?
Happy Thanksgiving from Jake and Amir!
Come on...
...Ah...
I don't know what to say, Man...I never said I wasn't going home for Thanksgiving.
I am going home for Thanksgiving, for the whole weekend; my train leaves in like, two hours.
Yeah, turkey's not even cooked a little.
It is.
It's uncooked.
It's still in the wrapping.
I mean you have to bake it.
Ouu wow, dripping a little bit.
Hey...do you have anywhere to go?
No,  I mean, like, for Thanksgiving.  Do you have somewhere to go?
No, be real with me for a second, okay?  Do you have somewhere to go for Thanksgiving?
Alright, Dude, I'll tell you what.
God, I can't believe I'm about to do this.
I'm sorry I have to lock in this room for the next five days.
I don't trust you not to show up at my family's Thanksgiving; you've done it every year for the past four years.
I considered it, then I thought better of it.  Okay, look, the good news is that you have enough food here to last you through the weekend.
Eat the yams.
Look, eat the yams, alright?  I'll be back in five days.
I'd rather eat a baby...
I just want to avoid death.
Stop it!
...A whore.
Relax man... stop trying to be like overly bubbly.
Don't touch me, man..!
Text message.
It's because I can ignore it.
Stop talking like you're on a radio show!
Cow.
Because I'd be far away, disconnected...
Yes, you have...
You've had a couple of failed attempts of trying to blow up a cow... from a distance..
Yep.
Stand.
I have no idea..
You're watching Jake and Amir.
That's implied.
You know what, don't. Okay, 'cause I'm still mad at you.
You crashed my Thanksgiving dinner. You showed up at my house, drunk and high.
You peed in my living room. You walked in while everybody was watching football. You were higher than I've ever seen anybody in my entire life. You said time to drain the main hose and then you peed on my couch.
We're in New York.
My uncle was really nice to offer us a ride.
You're screaming now.
You were just screaming. Now you're screaming. Oh my God, now you're doing that high-pitched squealing, oh my God!
Happy.
Eight.
Am I playing or are you?
You told my aunt that her yams were dry.
And you were grabbing both of her breasts while you said it.
Oh my God, why did you do that?
Jesus, dude!
My grandfather needs that oxygen tank to survive. You went up to him during dessert and said hey Scuba Steve let me take that tank for a test swim. You ripped all the tubes out of his nose, stuck them up your butt, and farted. How do you live with yourself?
Fine.
Wow, mean text from your dad.
Sorry to miss you at Thanksgiving, not.
It's a picture of him burning your childhood room.
That's mean.
I know.
How do you fail a personality test? They just tell you what kind of personality you have.
Okay, got it.
Whoa!
Oh, boy.
Right here you ask your dad for his address and he just straight-up says no.
You said please and he doesn't respond for four full days. He finally says 554 go fuck yourself lane, Topeka Kansas in the good ole U.S of gay. He attached a picture of your entire family, without you, eating a turkey dinner.
You know what, man? I'm happy you came back with me for Thanksgiving.
Why is that funny?
I don't think it is.
Alright, who's Todd?
Alright, you guys can't drink in the office. Also, who are you?
Fine.
I don't care.
Don't do this. Come on.
Come on, don't be a pussy.
You just called me a pussy.
What are you talking about?
Your best friend in the whole world? I've known Amir for 5 years, and I've just heard of you.
You said you were his oldest friend.
I didn't say it, but you do.
None of that stuff is mine.
Now you guys are both saying pussy.
You just threw up!
I wasn't texting...
Yeah.
For what?
...And Amir.
Jesus.
Hey, dude, your 48 frantic texts said you were getting robbed.
I came here because I thought you were in danger.
You swore on your father's life that you just witnessed a double murder. You were hiding in a garbage can because you saw two Puerto Rican deli workers get hacked to bits? Your voice mail ended with you saying I think they see me and then six minutes of screaming.
I wouldn't.
Doesn't sound like the correct name for that, right?
Okay, seriously, don't touch me! Alright? Why did you invite me here?
I guess.
Read what?
Did you feel like you ran up the wall and did a back flip?
He hits a zone, you hit the wall.
Your first reaction was to say Ah, ganked that. Do you think that was a good thing?
He's the professional, and he says it's not.
Okay, don't do that. He's obviously being nice and trying to teach you.
Wow! Oh my God, your arm is dislocated bad.
You're watching Jake and Amir.
I already said both names.
No.
Yes I did, I just said no really quickly.
How is that different than checking it out, which I just said no to?
Okay, so I'm not gonna check out the album.
-You're crying.
Okay, one: you're still crying, two: it sounds like you want me to promote the album.
Stop saying that! And it's not the least I can do; the least I can do is ignore you, which I plan on doing.
Oh, no...
Okay, is this the album?
Sounds like you should be pissed.
I know.
What's a bad amount of money?
So this is the album.
Awesome. Take my name off the title.
What?
-Take my name off the title!
That you spent a bad amount of money-
Relax! You're yelling, okay?
Not how that goes.
What?
What e-mail?
You asked me if I got the e-mail.  I said 'what e-mail?'.  What
That e-mail came in a week ago!
You gotta stop it with that Not joke, okay?  It never works.
Why is it so bad?
We randomly choose a co-worker to give a gift to at the Christmas party?
I was done talking.
I was finished.
Yes, go ahead.
That's how a conversation works; I'm done talking!  You don't...What is...I don't even know...What happening right now?
So don't sign up.
You're a bad person.
You know you're crying?
You're crying right now, okay?!  You realize you're almost 30 and you're crying?  You cry more than any
You've come to say you cry more than any other adult I know.
If you know then make a change!
That's like a baby excuse for why they would cry.
I didn't call you my baby.
Just pick a name, Dude.
Come on.
You're watching Jake and Amir.
I didn't.
Hey, hey, don't touch her alright?   Sorry.
Nobod
Nobody's arguing that, alright, but can I ask you a question?  You know, everybody else looks normal here, what are you wearing?
They're clearly not jeans.  It's some pink onsie.
And you shit yourself!
Not a good reason.  That's a bad reason to shit in your pants.  And like, you scotch taped mistletoe above your...
You have fresh shit in your onsie and you're trying to get your dick sucked?
You're horrible.
Just go open your gift, you fucking sociopath.
Stop it.  That'sIt's not a nice gift.
Okay, you know what?  Stop it, you guys.
I'm disappointed in all of you guys.
Stop it, they want you to kill yourself.
Look, you guys, I know Amir isn't the easiest person to work with, okay?  I know more than anybody.  But it's a holiday season, a season of second chances. right?  So why don't you say we put aside our differences for 12 hours, we go downstairs, we have the best holiday party this company has everOH!
NO, NO!
You're watching Jake and Amir.
Oh my god, you don't have to talk.
It is a kitchen.
Okay, okay. Don't yell at them. Hey, did you wash your hands? That's the one thing they asked us to do.
I don't trust you. Did you wash your hands?
I don't.
Well, I did. I'm saying I don't believe you.
Let me serve the soup. Let me serve--
Yeah, look, there's a long line of people here.
They shouldn't have to.
They shouldn't have to.
They should have--
Hey, can I see your hands?
You haven't washed your hands in a week?
You shouldn't be. Don't serve soup anymore! Okay? Hey, his hands are really dirty, bud. Don't put out the tip jar!
Oh my god. You wrote T-I-P-E-J-R-E. Tipejre.
Ohhh.
Okay, so you're not kidding. You're not giving him soup!
Oh, come on.
You showed up outside the soup kitchen this morning completely high. You were handing out water bottles filled with Vodka to people, saying one free bottle of godwater to anybody who goes home right now and skips dinner. You know you got twelve people to leave.
It is. You know what, it is. Be ashamed of yourself.
Doesn't. That makes me feel worse.
This soup is freezing cold, man. You had one job was to put it on the burner.
What are you talk--
Because you dumped soup everywhere.
Fine, you go home. I'll clean.
They still are.
What?
What are you talking about?
What's wrong with it?
Those all sound like one thing.
You didn't keep quiet at all! You found out about it 10 seconds ago and you were yelling about it ever since. And looking at your Facebook profile, it looks like, wow, yeah, you've protested every single Facebook redesign!
First of all, you didn't. Second of all, that doesn't change my point. Look at this first group, okay? Four years ago: Ten thousand strong against the Facebook newsfeed
Facebook was flawless and now it's garbage. They had a perfect game going.
Fine. Six months later you wrote, Holy carp, why change perfection? Facebook is without flaw, but new design change makes it official: they just jumped the shark. A hundred thousand strong against this Obamanation.
Right.
No it didn't. No membersyou're not even a member! Jesus Christ! Next one: Delete the Facebook Graffiti Wall. It's a joke and a fool. Two weeks later: One million strong to bring back Graffiti Wall. I know I abused it, but I miss it.
Lemme ask you a question: do you notice a pattern?
Oh my god, your voice is painful! Look, here's another thing man: every single week you try to start a national Deactivate Facebook Day. Like, here's one that says Zark Fuckerberg is gonna start charging for Facebook. Please read now and delete your account.
No he didn't!
You just lied, then, cause you said he did start charging.
You know you said that two years ago: Ten million strong against the new Facebook, cause they just made it Myspace.
Oh my god, stop crying! You just said it was perfect. The same version you hated two years ago, you just called it perfect.
By the way, have you been to Myspace recently? It's just a music video website. There's no profiles or anything.
Cause they jumped the shark
You're watching Jake and Amir...
Bad impression.
It was really nice actually...
I'm just saying it was nice to see my family, it was fun to hang out with my friends from high school...
The back of your face?
Hey! Don't ruin my day with this sad sad story...uncross the eyes, there it is.
Jesus Christ...
Why did you even go home?!
Tried?
Yeah, I would be too.
Oh no...
So oh no was right, by the way, and, what girl?
Why do you want his affection?  It sounds like he's a terrible person.
No, he doesn't.  How could he possibly mean well?
Wrong.
You haven't been right about any of the things you've said, well, ever.
Not really.
That sounds like the worst idea ever.
Isn't that just when he knocks you out with a...
I have a dad.
Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir.
I said "Hey..."
Are you upset that I didn't buy any cookies?
Because I'm upset that you showed up to work four hours late and you're wearing a skirt and you're trying to act like it's normal.
I guess not.
So I don't have that second option.
Nice.
No.
I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say that you're definitely not a Brownie, because I think if you tried to sign up they would arrest you for being a pedophile.
You're not wearing a sash.
Do they have patches there?
Right, there's your badge for not giving a shit.
Doesn't sound official.
That pin says "Most Bitchly!"
Listen to your voice.
Don't let it get to that octave.
Don't let it get up here!
You get really excited and start talking really fast like-
Yeah, yeah yeah.
You just did it.
What's the game plan here? Sell the cookies, raise money for like-
...What?
You're a bad guy.
I didn't say anything.
I heard it!
Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir.
AAHH, he cut me! He cut me!
Hey.
Fortune cookie, nice.
Don't yell!
You sure it wasn't inside that fortune cookie that you just opened? There's crumbs all over you.
How is it cookie sand if it was a sandnut? Also, neither of those things exist. Cookie sand and sandnut? You made them both up.
Sounds like you're trying to remember what the fortune cookie said, now you're not quite getting it.
First part makes sense, the second part does not sound smart.
How'd you know it was gay?
Was it another male beetle?
Why'd you eat it?
Fine. Whatever. Cause create your own reality, don't wait for happiness, right?
Ugh, new laugh?
It's bad.
Lemme see the fortune.
It is only in creating that that that joy that you can be in the zone.
Where did you get these?
Lemme have one.
OW, OW!
It's sharp and hot!
Where's the for- AGH there's a beetle in here!
Stick to the script...
Hey, nine hours late today.
Thursday, and why is your shirt soaking wet?
Was hard... Never act like I'm incorrect.
It's Thursday, and you just thought it was Monday.
Start making sense, now.
You said: haahahaa... Not today!?
I'm gonna stop you right there because you didn't dry it.
I'm not gonna talk to you for the rest of the day I think...
It's 20 degrees outside, do you not feel cold?
So cold.
Yeah, you're numb because you're cold.
Unclench your fist. What are you doing? Chill out, okay? You want to now ha?
Why are you being so agressive right now?
You did a bad job.
Ooh, no you didn't.
It's vinegar.
Why vinegar?
It's exactly what it means, yes.
Are you waiting for me to cry, or-
You're crying.
You're crying.
What are you...What's a beef?
No, we're not.
We're not b-
We're not.
You're beefing.
You are beefing.
Oh my god I feel so sorry for you right now.
Allright.
You're watching Jake and Amir.
You don't even have to be here.
What?
Okay fine, throw me away.
I'm going on vacation, don't freak out.
You alright? Are you putting on sun glasses?
Oo, dropped 'em.
Look, just ask me the question.
Why didn't you take off your other glasses?
I'm going to Los Angeles.
You said the whole thing.
Stop acting surprised, okay? I told you about this every single day for a month.
Hey, by the way I'm going to L.A. in a few weeks.
Hey, just remember I'm going to L.A. in a few weeks.
Hey, where am I going in a few weeks?
There you go.
I'm going to L.A.
Yeah.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
No, you didn't.
You think you're coming with me?
Then you didn't just correct me.
How is, how is, no! No. That doesn't make any sense.
You're not invited.
You have to know you're not invited, you're currently begging to come!
Wow, I'm not taking you.
Yeah.
Right, sounds like the same joke!
You're not coming. Okay. You followed me to Florida, you crashed my Thanksgiving this year, you somehow managed to wind up on every single family vacation I've ever been on. You know what? You've followed me to L.A. before. Do you remember that?
How do you do that so fast?  You are not coming with me.
Why did you just say deal?
You are Amir.
Ahh my face!
You hid a boxcutter in my jacket, man.
I'm so sorry.
That's wrong.
Sit down.
That was really really crass.
I'll get up, here.
Shouldn't be this hard.
What? What?
Oh my godlook at you! Why do you do this, you're crgo a day! Go one day without breaking down and crying about
Dope?
Oh my god! What is that?
Why?
That's not gonna work out, because wow, you're really hard right now.
Jesus christ, you can't watch porn up here dude.
This porn is illegal.
You know, we heard themyou did wet your pants, right?
Jesus christ.
They still are.
What time is it?
Why did you...
Stop singing...
Stop singing that song!
It's not about a fun vacation, it's about a... Why did you get me up this early?
Just tell me.
No, I don't think that was nice, it wasn't nice of you to make tea this early and then wake me up.
Bad logic. Bad logic, right? Make the tea later.
If you knew I was gonna say that then why did you do it?
Okay then you didn't know! So don't...
Dude, why did you do that?
That was two.
Just tell me what the itinerary is...
Great. Done. Next.
Bad order.
Jesus Christ.
Okay stop it, do you think we're at the Grand Canyon?
A lot of this stuff is canyon related.
Great. Easy. 9 a.m: Get a view of the canyon, she is grand, and she is canyon.
10 a.m: Get matching Grand Canyon tattoos. They should read This friendship is as grand as the canyon. Arizona.
Yeah. 11 a.m. just says Arizona eight times in a row.
No it's... We're in a... No it's not.
The stuff that's not canyon related is just straight up mean.
Oh my god, stop with the voice.
1 p.m: Break all the baby food at the supermarket so the babies have no food?
2 p.m. says French kiss a French bulldog. Why do you wanna do that?
Tit punched, right, I...
Oh my god, it's boiling!
Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir.
Nice.
Twice. Definitely. I also heard you practicing it last night.
Where'd you get that?
Because we're on vacation from work.
Because it's nice outside.
Why ask the question if there's not a right answer?
Jesus Christ!
Why?
You heard us talking and then you thought we were cows?
Nobody asked that.
You did not ask that. I am standing right next to you.
Is that related? Who- Stanley Grylls?
The way you s- The way you said it made it sound like you-
Out of the net?
Relax. What are you even doing here?
Cows?
Why do you think cows are dangerous?
You're saying they're all caused by beef?
What do you- You don't know what beef is?
I'm not kidding.
No. I'm not kidding.
I'm not kidding.
Why do you think that cows are the number 1 killer in all the world? What about, car accidents?
Milwaukee is in the United States and no, that's not true. Where did you get that information?
Okay, not how you pronounce it. That's a cartoon.
A cartoon based on jokes.
Just-just jokes. Just don't laugh like that. Oh God. What are you guys doing? Just making each other laugh like this? Why?  Are you flirting right now? Is this how you flirt with each other?
OW!
No!
Why did you think I was a cow?
Fingers? Cows have hooves.
Draw a cow!
It'll take you 2 seconds.
That is so sad.
First of all, he's not my friend. Second of all, he's not missing. He's right-
Where is he?
No.
I said I didn't have one so it's not good, right?
Oh! So wet! Why did you do that?
Don't smell me! I'm serious, don't.  I've asked you so many times.
Don't do either! I haven't seen which way he went, but he's dragging a net, he couldn't have gone far.
No, not the name, he's dragging a net.
I'll tell you what, man.
Let's just split up, we'll cover more ground that way,  don't smell me.
How is that one better? By the way, dude, it's 90 degrees.
Focus!
Be normal! Be normal for a second, we have- No, you're not. We have to find Amir, we have to work together.
Shut up, Ok? Amir's really scared right now.
Who's there?
Interrupting me-
Ok, that's great, I know, so can we please just focus? And find Amir? Alright, I'm gonna just try calling him and see if he answers.
Well, no, I have four bars.
Did you swallow it?!
How and why did you just eat my phone?
Yeah, you gotta walk on your own for a minute.
No, I'm not tired.
Stop it, I'm not tired.
Stop it, I'm not-
It doesn't matter. Even if I was tired I wouldn't need you to tickle me.
No, don't test the waters.
You just tested the waters and it didn't work out, right?
That's Amir. Hey, dude.
Are you Ok?
Don't say that, 'cause then this guy's gonna-
Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir.
No we're not.
You were just singing.
That's not how that works.
Such a bad laugh. It's like you're not breathing.
No, let it out.
Stop it, it makes me, like, anxious.
What' funny right now to you?
You're like a choking animal.
Don't.
Where?
What GPS?
We have to get to the airport. We have to make our flight. This is the only way we can go.
Don't say jerk as you fart like that. Roll down your window.
Your phone has been dead for three days.
Why would you do that?
It doesn't matter why there's traffic. We have to stay on this road no matter what.
Gimme my phone.
How bout you don't.
Please don't.
Fine.
Fine, I'll be your slave for a month.
No.
Okay, I'm not even pissed, alright? You just owe me five hundre--Oh my God.
Hey! Get in the car.
You're watching Jake and Amir
No, she didn't
First thing first I'm teaching you how to brush you teeth, right? So put pants on.
Not one that...
Grey, is what I was going to say. Alright, the key to brushing your teeth efficiently is...
Circular motion. Okay, stop acting like you know what I'm going to say.
You want to get just a little bit of tooth paste on the brush like this.. Stop peeing! Stop Peeing!
It's getting on my legs!
No, not on my legs.. Stop peeing! Okay, you want to start with your bottom teeth like this.
Jesus, what is that?
Look at you, you're just brushing your gums, how are your teeth not insanely yellow.
Seriously?  Oh my God, they're so soft
They felt like white beans
They're softer than cooked rice
Alright, you want to get the floss real nice and tight like this, and then slide it.
I'm serious man you've got to stop white stripping
You're teeth feel like velvet
Like little rectangles of flannel or something
A mouth full of packing pieces
They're loose too, I feel like I could just flick one out, no problem
No, they don't
I just did, did you forget about how this conversation originated
Exactly!
Slide it through the tooth gently
You should be brushing your teeth for a full two minutes, three times a day
Why do you think it's an hour?
Alright blood is good, it means your gums are getting healthy
No, you're controlling the floss, so you're being a little bitch pricking yourself
I'm not saying it doesn't work, but I'm just saying you shouldn't do it.
shouldn't be
No, that's okay
The floss? You didn't get a bad string, you're going too hard on your gums
Okay, want to take a little break?
Oh hey, you awake
You're watching Jake and Amir.
Didn't spell it, just said it.
You know you can change your middle name, right?
Wow...that was...
No, it was good.  It was really, really good.
Dude, it was incredible.
Yeah!  I welled up a little.  Who're you giving that to?
Hey, hey, hey!  N-n-n-no, no Man!
No, Dude, I lost it!  It was better than yours and now it's gone!
It's a placeholder.  It's a suckier version of the card I wrote; a dummy version.
I'll read it to you and if you think it's shwing-worthy then it might just be my actual card.
You are blazing to me.  You are so blazing.  No, you're better than blazing; you're blazin'.  No 'g', just an apostrophe, you don't need a 'g', 'cause I'm your G.  So we drop the 'g'.    And tonight, you gonna drop your g-string.  Let me see that crack, Girl.  I bet it ain't whack, Girl.  Love, your not-so-secret-admirerer, J-Witz.    If you thought it sucked it's only because I can't read for shit.
You say that and you mean it, but you're wrong.
What did yours say?
'Cause I'm gonna amend mine!  A little bit!  Based on some of the words you said.
Just say some of it 'cause I can't remember how stupid it was!
That's all!
It was like, "how can I count the ways by-like how many thoughts within thoughts, within thoughts and then nostalgia for our future and past already" or something like that.  "How can I possibly
I knew you were too dumb to appreciate it.    Fuck it, kiss me.
Gotcha!  Haha.
Hey, you're watching Jake and
You interrupted me!
Think about it...
No thinking about it?
You stumped?
You know, even if you get it I'm not gonna be impressed because you started at Q.
Back to work, okay?
Did you hear me when I said go back to work?
I didn't ask what it was.
Fine. What's it called?
Forget it. Forget I asked
Bad. Bad title. So stupid.
Oh my god, I hate that he has children.
How olwhat?!
He hathat's septuplets!
That seems less likely.
I am surprised.
That's true.
Tipping's not mandatory. You don't have to do it. But, a lot of waiters and service persons rely on the income
What about gifts?
Don't bring a gift to a funeral.
No! Right, buddy? Come on. Have you been to a funeral?
Look. Just try to unlearn whatever you just read about in Leron's ezine.
Stupid rhyme.
Yes they are.
God that was impressive.
Do you plan that out? Like the, Go outside and pretend it's not Thanksgiving, feast your eyes on this, you plan that out?
Wow. Learn the alphabet.
Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir.
Why are you twisting your nipples?
What were you doing? Just staring at me?
Yeah.
You said new shirt, what do you want me to say to that? How should I respond?
I'm trying to
I didn't finish talking. You interrupted me and you said what, mid-sentence.
It's actually long sleeve, rolled it up.
It's new, yeah.
I'm not gonna tell you where I bought the shirt. Stop! Why do you wanna know? Why do you care?!
YeaI'm notokay, so that's exactly why I don't want to tell you.
I don't want to give you  go out there wearing the same shirt. You want everyone to think we're twins? You want that to
That'sit's a bad plan.
I hateright, right, right, it'syour veins are popping out of your neck so bad! Breathe! Breathe in! Breathe in! Stop yelling
Five, four, alright
Oh my god! You... Oh... You know what, you couldn't pull this shirt off.  You won't look good in this shirt! This shirtit's
Younothat's so pathetic. You're just gonna walk into?
What? You're about to cry! You're about to cry! Look at your eyes. Look at your eyes.
Oh you want to alternate! So that means, like, I have to call you before workI have to check in with you to see if you're
I'm notthen we can just share this shirt by your logic, right? Yeah
Knowing that you wanna do that ultimately really freaks me out. StopI wanna s
FINE! I got it at Forever 21! Okay? Are you happy now? Forever 21! There's a unisex section upstairs!
You're watching Jake and Amir!
Why are your hands so sticky?
It was inappropriate.
Did you buy bagels for everybody just so you can act like an asshole?
You can't do that.
You showed up with bagels around your nipples.
You said "bagels on me."
And now, you're demanding money, not as a joke, right? You can't do that, it's fucked up.  It's a form of robbery.  It's extortion.  It's also pronounced bagel.
You're saying bagel.
No, wrong it's-
It's-
Let me say it.  Because you said it wrong three times in a row, ok?
Let's go one syllable at a time.
Say "beig"
"el"
Bagel.
Relax, dude.
No way, how long?
Jesus. You know, dude, she didn't even take a bagel.
You never had any intention at all of giving these away for free, did you?
I hate that you can put those on so quickly.
You have a job. You could make so much more money doing a good job here, in the office. Did you really blow Uncle Sam in your dream last night?
That's not even- how much did you spend on these bagels?
I just did. I think you got ripped off.
Oh, what is going on?
Say it!
What is it?
Take those off!
Whoah, I can still get with girls. That's not the issue.
I missed a spot, I missed one spot, so I said 'fuck it, I'll go with a chinner'
Winner Winner Chicken Chinner, yeah! Any questions?
Not a question.
Here's a science fact: Chicks dig scars. Or was Ice Cube at the 'Are We There Yet' cast  crew after-party sponsored by Voss Water not stylin'?
Does it matter? 'Cause I can shave it off. Also, it was a joke! I build up a defensive wall so thick you can't get through it with dynamite.  How's that for insecure?
A chin strap for this thin chap make the fat booty go clap. I made out with my nephew. At a house party.
I get invited to house parties, is what I'm saying.
He's a little twerp.  Him and his friends beat the shit out of me and pissed on my jeans.
Chin strap. No. I crashed their party and I was j-
To their house party? No.
Not that one! I get invited to other house parties. I wasn't invited to this one. I get invited to other house parties, ok? Anyway I show up, I'm jackin' all the poon,  they come up to me and they're like 'uh uh dude, you weren't invited, and we're 16'
A little bit, yeah! And I obviously forgot to mention that I was
It's called you polish off a bottle of  Robitussin, you wash it down with two pumps of capri sun. I would eat dog shit if Bradley Cooper did it in Limitless.
Dude, I'm shaving it.
This chin strap, it's obviously a goof, I'm shaving it as we squeak.
So do I. It does make me look quite 'strapping'
Dude, I was joking too.  Haha. Tell me what to think.  Honestly, because I'll pull the hair out right now if you say the word.
Dude, he for real! I made out with my nephew.
House party. Tell them where it was, dude.
We're beefing.
We're beefing.
We beef.
We can't use that!
It's called grinding, you giant ass! You rub your boner against women to prove to society that you're worth a shit.
Got really close once, but I got cocky, started tweeting #victory, scarred the bitch off.
Woulda' been a total loss, but I got victory trending in NYC.
NOT the trending part!
Well not every night, usually I come here at like 4 PM. I have to get here before the bouncer because these clubs are exclusive as shit. Great question, I hide in the men's room and pretend I'm the janitor.
Alright dude, practice; pretend I'm a hot girl.
Hey babe.
Oh my God, my boy's got it! It's called negging, dude, insult the bitch and make her come to you!
Hey beautiful..
FAKE tits, FAKE tan, fake Louis Vuitton; there ain't one real thing about ya, sister!
Will you date me? Will you date me? Cuz I'll be exclusive, and you don't have to be. How's that for--
Dude! Dude don't touch me right now, I'm thirty seconds away from getting line-poon.
One drink, okay I'm begging you, one drink, and then I'll grind on you like you've never been ground before.
Damn girl. Aight, you fly.
Ahkey! Chill!
Hey, why don't you dump your iPhone boyfriend and go out with this Man-Droid?
Ooh my God! Stop being mean to me!
Hey everybody, check it out, I think there's a whale at this party, somebody's got a blow-hole.
Yo you're ugly! I wouldn't fuck you with his dick!
Ok well I wouldn't.. take his dick to fu-- You're a fuckin' ten. You're a ten, okay? Can I have your number?
Here's my phone, put in your number. It doesn't even have to be the real number, I'll never call it
Hey dude.  Dude!
It can be fake if you want, I'll chalk it up as a W. I just wanna show my boys that I got one number tonight!
I'm a big bear, man! I got these claws, and these fangs, and I'm just battin' the bunny around!  With this, what do I do with the bunny- It's from Swingings! With Jon Favers, and Vince Vang!
Pop quiz, hotshot, do you have game?
It's called game. You use it to get with chicks, it's the most important thing in the world.
None due respect dude, FUCK your childhood dog!, ok, this is more important. You know Game of Thorns? This is Game of Thongs!
Game of Thongs, I said. D-D-DO YA HAVE IT, GAME?
Uh, you go find a girl, you grind on her, like this, oh hey  WHOA! DUDE, RELAX, I DIDN'T SEE A RING, DUDE!
I didn't see a ring!
You see a ring??
Auh she has a ring, dude?!
What are you doing, you're twenty-nine, why would you use this ID?!
Nope, they're not.
Closer.
It's MichiGAN, not MichiCAN, and why 'straight to the final four with ya'?
Well, they're a number one seed, so it wouldn't really be getting lucky--
You said getting lucky.
What is wrong with you? You have to write down a winner each round. You can't have an arrow going from round one--
You only picked upsets last year. Sixteens over ones, fifteens over twos.
In our work pool, you finished dead last.
Every single upset.
Last!
Just focus on this!
No, I won't. You know why? 'Cause your one video on there is nine-and-a-half minutes long and it's you psyching yourself up to eat a ghost pepper, which you never do. At the nine minute mark, you faint from fear. You know, you don't even have to upload that video, right?
You know, I was trying to ignore you, but since you're pressing me for an answer, no, not right. It's really stupid.
That is why I almost didn't tweet it! Wow, I'm gonna delete it!  Where's my fucking phone, dude?
This is my wallet!
You know what, I don't even think they're gonna let you participate if you don't pay back the money you owe from the last four March Madness pools.
No you didn't! Let's look back just last year. You were mathematically eliminated after the first day. You begged Johnson Hussey for your money back, when he finally gave it to you, you said, Keep the change you filthy animal. I'ma buy back in at a G. You submitted what turned out to be a perfect bracket and a thousand dollars in cash--
Then you showed up, rolling on E to our office party for the finals. You shredded the money, tore up your bracket and pissed on Sunusi's phone. You screamed, All contracts are null and Lloyd! Then you started crying when no one realized it was an Entourage reference.
Arrie, right.
All right, I think this is it. These picks--
Oh my God, are you seriously bringing back that Kanye thing, dude?
No, we're not, because that's last year's answer key.
None of the first-round matchups are the same.
That's true, but don't... say it like that.
You interrupted me!
You have your final score in the championship being a tie.
Your final score is 20-20.
No? It's not Mon-can-a!
What are you--

amir: Ya!
You said you could do a British accent.
Oh my god, get up, get up right now.
Sit at your own desk, dude!
Ugh you farted!
That would make me not a douchebag.
If I forgot to take douchebag pills, then I wouldn't be a douchebag.
What?
Dude, stop talking to me. For the rest of the day.
That makes me wanna know less.
Hey, do me a favour man!
They'd all be weird massages!
Yeah! What?! Just fast forward to the end of the story, okay! I don't have time to hear a three minute story that just ends in me
Kobayashi?
Yes, a lot.
Kobayashi, like the hotdog eating guy?
So he's in the kitchen.
I can just walk into the kitchen right now and see world record holder Kobayashi sitting there waiting for you to feed him
This is really weird. I think even by your standards we can agree that this is really weird. Right? What do you want me to say?
I thought all your stories were lies.
Especially this one.
Hey this is pretty sweet man, can I feed him?
No, hey! Hey hey hey! Dude! What do I do?!
Big?! That's for bears!
He's not a bear!
Just let me sit here for one second, okay? I've had a shit day.
Time's running out.
What?
Why'd you say none of my business and then immediately answer my question?
Yeah, you did:  amir@dailydizzydinkydeals.com, you gotta change that email address.
What's so hard about the survey?  What are some characteristics of a good employee at
You should hate to say that. Everybody else hates when you do it.  Where do you see yourself in five years?
Why does your cousin respect you?
You said it! Right up top, you said your cousin had to do a profile on somebody he respects.
-And you just said 'Go fuck yourself' to him. What grade is he in?
You know what, Where do you see yourself in five years? let's write 'dead', and hope for the best, right?
How important was your high school education in getting your job? Do you think it's important for high-schoolers to take their education seriously?
-I was done.
Jesus Christ, that was the worst thing I've ever heard in my entire life.
You don't know. You couldn't possibly know how bad it was because if you did, you probably would've
Oh, shave 'em!
You should.
Math was crap / If you wanna know why, then steal a hen.
What an awful, ugly pair of sentences. Yeah, bad!
-You agree? Why'd you do it?
Dude, I feel bad for you! I legit feel bad for you; that was like one of the simplest things I've ever seen
No it didn't, the beat was fine.
Did he come up with the rap?
So it sounds like he did everything right, and you did everything wrong.
I think I have to turn off my computer and just go home, that really ruined my day.

amir: Beat was crap, the rap was crap-
-Beat was fine, beat was good! Rap was really bad.
Why couldn't you think of a rhyme for crap?
Hey, Hey, Hey! Y'all losers can't record a song without a bomb! Effa effa effa bumf Ass Chorus!
Bomb ass I said!
Not till you hear this chorus! - Beat starts-  Mary J Blidge ain't got nothin' on these pipes and speakin' of pipes I'm high. I'm high, I'm hiiiiighhhhh!
Why don't you try better?
Cut, cut. Way too original, way too loud. Amir, whose chorus did you like better?
Better or worse, specify you stupid shit!
Okay a denny's for your tots, cos' this next one's about to be a grand slam.
Dude, I'm about to okay. This next one is a diss track to both y'all and you deserve it. Hoodie a beat.
Not till you hear this! - Beat starts- Ahhh, I only need one shot, one job, one take, one chance to come at you, I don't need take two, I'm one take Jake! I'm and I'm...startin' it over. One sec.
Now I only need one shot, here it is. Three wishes genie? Nah, I only need one, one punch, one hunch, I'm a spitfire and I never start over!  And I ahhh, fuck, alright.
So is star wars doofus, or do you think that really happened? It's called art imitating wife. Showing diamond engagement ring
He liked it and he put a ring on it oh oh oh oh oh etc .
I robbed a fiance, I robbed her okay, call me out on it like a chump why don't you? Why don't we just see who gets famous first.  Arrivadorchies!
NOOO!
I, eh, one second
NOOOO!
Hey, you are watching Jake and Amir.
Why?
Hey dude, kinda weirded out that you asked my mom out on a date over Facebook.
Don't.....
Look, she just signed up for Facebook, and the first thing she gets is a request from you saying that the two of you guys are in a relationship.
I don't wanna rock out like that.
My mom is married.... to my dad.... and they're both kind of freaked out about that message that you sent her.
Should've said great, right?
No it's not.... it's vodka and red bull.... stop....
That's a solid rhyming effort, but I really just wish you didn't send my mom a picture of you with your penis tucked behind your legs, with the caption "Another day at the
That is not the case, ever! And look, real quick, just as an aside, explain why you wrote all this on a scroll? Like on some ancient scroll that you seem to have?
Pooh!
She's a he!
It doesn't matter, you know what? Because my dad just emailed me. You're spamming his Facebook wall with big dick porn! I mean how dare you?
Not a beer.....
Terrible way to live your life! Make a change!
Stop yelling.
I'm just gonna go ahead and guess that it's either not a beer or it doesn't matter....
My mom?
Wait, my mom or your mom?
You're watching Jake and Amir!
What?
Hey, hey dude. Are you alright?
You tweeted you were gonna kill yourself in a P.G.I. Fugley's bathroom!
Yeah, you are. Will you stop calling my family? Okay? Did you-  Did you tell them it was your brithday?
-I'm not.
Sad.
No, I'm not gonna sit on your lap!
Stop it.
It wasn't.
Didn't ask it.
Dan?
Dan?
Ben?
Den?
Dan?
Din?
Den? Like the room?
Right, Snatcher.
Dan?
I would have presumed that anyway.
That's not the phrase.
I think I see what happened here. You obviously took to heart what I said last week when I said?
I was about to?
I was about to?
?and you interrupted me!
You do that a lot, you start talking?
?when other people are talking.
Don't ask me if I'm ready to start?
Yes, I'm ready. Are you not gonna talk?
Give me five seconds?
Five seconds. Don't?
Don't count down! You counting is not being silent, right? Just?
You obviously took to heart what I said last week when I said I've never heard you have a normal conversation with a normal
Unzip that hoodie?
Aww, don't be proud! That shirt says I've never had a normal conversation with a normal person in my entire life. I'm a loser!
When I told you that last week you welled up. You welled right up like I told you your parents were dead.
Wow, dark. You welled up and you said, I'll show you you piece of clid.
I'll show you I have a friend so normal you won't believe it. Then you sprinted out of the office and I haven't seen you since.
?that you were eavesdropping on people's conversations, writing down everything you heard and then getting all of them wrong.
No, you didn't! You don't consider things dumb!
Right, because you also don't play things by year.
No, the phrase is you play things by ear.
You should have heard more than those five phrases by the way. And you didn't leave any space, so I can't imagine what, what was
Den? I can't imagine what Den was saying during that conversation. You should have left some pauses in there.
Jesus.
You know, what I said still stands, because that was not a normal conversation with a normal person.
There's already music
how did you get past the screening process? You can't be healthy enough to give blood

Oh my God put that away! What are you doing?

I saw an image on Reddit today.
{continues} of a guy jerking off in the subway
yeah and face was blurred out but I swear to God it was you
it's too late for that second of all
I guess the feeling of giving?
I know I saw the t-shirt
you have to stop making those shirts. They're mean and you're not good
how do you do that so fast?
{with hand on Amir's chest} Yo, I haven't felt anything in like, thirty seconds
yeah that's true
I'm actually getting a little light headed
no you fainted. Twice. Once for twenty minutes and once for an hour. Woke up, saw the needle and started crying. You also pissed yourself.
you came here in a skirt
For real, you and I have known each other for a really long time and I'm just {fist pump} yeah.. I'm like racking my brain right now trying to come up with just one nice thing you've ever done for anybody
OH MY GOD. du..du..du..dude STOP
I'm sorry to harp on it but you're just not a good guy and you have an ugly personality and a *black heart
you won't make a change that's the worst part you're selfish, you're stupid and you're mean.
we're at a blood bank man we do it for free

you don't need the cheddar
you don't need the cheese
you're a bad person
Let's say our names-
Hey.
Yeah, why?
No- DUDE!
No, not really.
I just told you I didn't feel bad.
Are you even hurt?
No.
Yes.
...What?
Yeah, I'm not gonna get you anything off of the Jake Fucked Me registry.
Why do you even want a Nunsmere Bronze Elephant Trunk Sconce?
This is extor-
What you're doing right now-
It's legally blackma-
I have all the time-
Here's a question, what are you gonna do if I DON'T get you a gift?
Aaaiieeeurgh! Chill, man!
Dude, yeah right, no way.. Nothing.
You know what, Murph? I've been working out, so I've got news for you: You come at me, I'm gonna run away so fast, that I'm gonna tell on you!
No!
Yeah, I don't know, what do you.. what do you want me to say?
I'm a bitch, I'm a bitch, come on!
I'M A BITCH! I AM, I REALLY AM! I'M A BITCH, OKAY?! I'M A HUGE FRIGGIN BITCH! Are you happy?
Come on, you want one too?
Okay, this is bullying, and I DO have to take it!
But you know what? I'm drawing the line, AND I AIN'T BUYING YOU YA GUYSES WALL SCONCES, alright?
Here's my wallet, you can use my money, but you're buying your own damn sconce! Think fast.
Weak, dude! Weak!
No, no-one's gonna catch me!
Fine, fine, just let me take off my studded belt.
I'm only wearing it because it's laundry day!
Do you want me to fall, or not?
WEAK!
Dude, it really kills.
...What the fu-
It was fine.
Such an offensive name.
But McMexican?
My heart, it's cold. I can't breathe.
First of all, you said we could
Second of all, I'm not improvising.
She's not improvising at all.
I look at you and I want to know more about you. Are you a foodie?
W..W...What!? Dude!
SHE'S TALKING SHE SAID IT!
I'm not talking to her at all! She was talking to me!
I DIDN'T EVEN WRITE THIS, AMIR WROTE THIS!
I DIDN'T IMPROVISE!
What the fuck man!
Wow, come on.
Hey, Man.
How you feelin'?
Buddy, you're not "Bueno".
Go home, just go home.
Yes, everyone would love that. You're covered  in puke and shit.
Said that, I said "shit".
Exactly, and when you have it, you go home.
You're obviously not toughing it out, right? You've been crying this entire time. Will you at least go to the bathroom?
Right, no one is going to "blows" you. Okay? Your crotch is covered in your own feces. Which is kind of crazy considering feces is supposed to come out the back.
Weird logic.
Right, wouldn't let you give me a noogie because your fingers, like your crotch, is just covered in your own shit and puke.
Because for dinner you had a raw chicken, egg, and cheese sandwich on a frozen hot pocket.
You asked me! You washed the entire meal down with a glass of warm toilet water.
Everybody was daring you to not do it.
So, just regular diarrhea?
Yeah, dude, I've been trying to kick you out of the office since I got here.
Dude, come on.
Don't! At least let me hand you a slice, you're getting shit all over the pizza.
What are you talking about? It's pizza!
Fine, don't yarf near the pizza!
You're not mid yarf, at least turn your head.
No, you can't even turn your head?
Amir ruined the pizza.
you're watching jake and amir
i'm not
shut up dude, you can't fix any problem, computer related or not in three seconds so just stop talking
what?
i have a seriously psychological problems?
you've got a problem too, you can't talk
you know what you poured apple jacks and milk all over my computer  okay, all my files might be erased
words didn't piss me off at all, you did, you and your apple jacks
i'm not blaming them, i'm blaming you
i'm not giving you the silent treatment, i'm talking to you
still, then it's not the silent treatment then is it right? so you were wrong when you said that
no you don't hey! stop!
he said swimming, try to listen, what hobbies do you have?
you're right, that's not a hobby
hey hey hey relax
chill out he didn't say that
you're crying right now? you were making fun of him, you started this, you called him king dork
you know what thirty seconds ago you were saying if words piss you off this much you have serious psychological problems
you're not, you weren't keeden, you said right after i'm not keeden
thanks man
no
you're not intuitive
Okay, dude, sorry but you have to stop posting on Reddit
You've posted thirty nine hundred times today
Then you're using that word wrong
Right, the last thing you uploaded thirty seconds ago was a picture of the guy from Futurama with, I think this is your dick-
photoshopped onto his forehead-
The text not sure if y'all commenters are a bunch of circlejerking divas or if I'm universally hated by everybody, it's the second thing
No, it's called a meme, wow y'no you also tried to start a ton of AMAs. I am a coward and a fool who's dad moved out on him not once not twelve but a dozen times, Ask me anything
My dad is a diva, ask me anything
I'll go dickless for Michael Chiklis, ask me almost anything
What is that?
Wrong. What the fuck is going dickless for Michael Chiklis?
You never get any upvotes, you have thousands of downvotes.
you are wrong
what are these hundreds and hundreds of posts on /r/trees just picture after picture of you trying to light a joint, your eyebrows on fire and you're crying and smiling.
okay right I see that I am high as a knife, ask me anything if this gets a thousand uptokes I won't kill myself? So sad.
That is sad because that's not very high and you went to a really dark place, threatened to kill yourself in an online community where everybody hates you
I won't, because you know what? your comments on all these other posts are actually really mean, like on this-
at the same time - video of a dog, are you serious, I'll give you a ton of examples, okay? like on this video of a dog squealing with joy when his soldier owner comes home
You did this for lols why the bitch is this on the front page? am I the only one who thinks dogs aren't cute or capable of having real emotions
Hundreds of downvotes
Yeah, do you not check, do you follow up at all?
You would be depressed if you went through your reddit history, okay, here's another picture posted here of the pope and the caption says prays for starving children while sitting on a golden throne.
what, you think that's funny now
cause you didn't when you left this comment atheist fucks going to hell for talking smack about this God guy, bury me with downvotes if you disagree. You know, why do you, why do you ask for the downvotes?
but if you agree, meet me at blockbuster, because we're renting rampart and then ramming each other's farts, then right under that you write Commenter above me is a philosopher, upvote him to karma heaven
Right under that you write I am the pope in this picture, ask me anything
stop trying to protect yourself, you're coming up with excuses, just admit nobody on Reddit likes you
This guy 'ForthewolfX' replied to you saying leave Reddit alone, love, everybody and his comment got  thousands of upvotes
and in response you decided to post a picture of Calvin trying to piss on Michael Chiklis, but there's no pee
did he go dickless-
Watching it, actually.
What the hell is wrong with you?
Inside the machine?
Oh my God...
So you're interrogating people?
What's that list?
He looks familiar, right?
That's because he's that guy that, like, can't come up with the names.
What's your name?
That's... a normal name for a food.
What's your last name?
Carrot Slat?
That's not normal.
Do you think that's normal?
What are your parents' names?
Color... um, green.
Do what?
No.
Jesus Christ...
In a day?
That's also really high.
Both of you guys are shitting way too much.
I shit once a week.
What the hell kind of interview is this?
I'm Jake...
No, that's offensive!
You grew a goatee?
Sounds a little suspicious, right? He started to say yeah.
How--
No.
Ow! ...Fuck, dude!
That wasn't nice. You just hit me! I didn't shit in th--
No.
Ow, can you--  Ow! Hey!
Nonono don't--  Ow! Ow--
What the hell is--
Stop-- ...Ohh...
Get off of me! What the fuck was that? He just gave me head.  Ow!
No! You just beat me up and sucked my dick.
Well, go back to your family!
Oh, my God...
What are their names?
Stanson's not that normal.
It d-- it means a lot--
I don't think that's what it's called.  Ow, stop it!
No, don't!
St-- quit flicking-- ohh... oh, my G-- he's sucking my dick!
That was illegal, man! That was illegal.
I didn't want that! I shit in the copier, okay? Stop beating me up. Stop sucking me off. I shit in the copier!
Why?
What the fuck?
That's not impressive.
Ow.
That's your penis.
No.
No.
I see that.
You know, it's actually not, but clearly think it is. Otherwise you wouldn't have gotten to work, set up the entire hookah, and
Nothing's coming out of your mouth so you're definitely not blowing smoke rings.
I don't think that's lit, man.
Why do you think this is cool?
I don't that think that is cool.
...what?!
No you didn't! You didn't say that! You said I'm have a pussy!
Have you even done any work at all today?
So setting up the hookah was your work.
Where's your computer? It's not out.
Is there a fucking cat in there with it?!
Your computer's not out, it's not on; you haven't done any work at all.
You have a work phone?
Where's your phone?
In the bag.
How are you checking it?
Gimme your phone.
It smells like soy sauce and yoghurt!
Not the lock screen. All the buttons are just stuck together, it's one giant button. You ruined your phone.
Stop trying so hard.
Yes.
Because he hired whores to french you so you'd feel better about yourself!
You know, with two grand you probably could have paid girls to do a lot more than just make out with you.
Stop!
Oh, bad odor!
I'm not meeting you here. Ok, I was just in here.
Don't think that I agreed to a meeting.
Sure.
Really? Number one says wiping.
That shouldn't be that hard.
No it's not.
Sorry, just look at your iPad, right? It's covered in cracks and barbecue sauce.
You haven't tried to clean it! Ok, treat your stuff better!
Number two on your list of shit that's hard to deal with is not shaking foreigners and demanding they speak English. Awful.
I know.
What's the app?
Stop, I don't hate the Papua New Guinean community.
How?
Cool, so that's why you have the, uh-
Ribs.
How is that not what it sounds like?
Oh my-
That app has been around for a while.
I feel so bad for you, man.
Fine.
What is that noise?
It just comes out of your mouth when I go to leave.
You haven't pitched me a good idea so don't worry about that, right?
Actually you know what?  I'm gonna take away the iPad. Because it costs a lot of money and you don't know how to take care of it. Sorry.
The case has more barbecue sauce on it than the iPad.
Don't talk to me like a bitter boyfriend or something.
You spit all over my fucking arm just now.
Stop!
Finding the time.
Your app idea just says the vowels.
Get-
Don't do that.
Alright, don't take this as a compliment.
That's your best app idea yet.
It's still terrible.
It's just all your other ideas are so bad.
Ok, don't take this-
Fuck you!
Hey, brace yourself 'cause this is not gonna be pleasant.
Quit.
Not even quit while you're ahead, quit while you're behind. None of these ideas were good. I would feel bad telling you to go back to the drawing board.
I feel like there's not even a single nugget of an idea that's worth exploring.
Furthermore,
You're not smart.
You're not getting better.
You don't have a mind that's capable of improving itself. You can't even take care of this iPad. So I say, let's toss out the iPad. We'll, we'll find something else for you to do, you know?
With your time.
I'm not sure you did.
That is sad, because it wasn't even close to being good enough.
You are weak.
You're watching a buff dude and Amir.

amir: Woah, cool tank top.
Woah, cool wrong word for it.
It's called a muscle tee, asswad.
Actually, scratch that. It's called six months of pumping iron for this one moment.
You think I'm not going to go to the park during lunch? I don't commit to wearing something that makes me feel vulnerable without having an airtight excuse for every line of questioning. Does that make me insecure? You bet your ass it does.
GQ Teen says the summer look is Toms shoes, Ray Bans, board shorts, and a muscle tee. Or was that Joseph Gordon-Levitt doppelganger that I saw at the Starbucks on 9th Avenue not styling?
Wasn't one hundred percent sure it was the 3rd Rock from the Sun star and upon asking for his autograph, I found out it was not. Still snagged this sweet pic though.
He was!
Because a sleeveless shirt for this piece of dirt makes that sweet pussy go squirt.
I 69'd my dad! At a rave!
I was obviously joking, the point is that I attend raves! And while I've never done anything more than kiss a bouncer on the cheek to get in and then be sold fake ecstasy by a sweaty teen, still cooler than your last Tuesday.
- I guess? Do you guess? Do you guess?  I shared a fucking glowing pacifier, dude, with a legit five-and-a-half. That's two points hotter than my last girlfriend.
Da da da dada I'm loving snatch!
No shlit, dude.
No, no! Hey don't you-
That's not a tank! Bad rhyme, doesn't count!
Get him outta here!
Get him outta here!
At a rave! Tell him where is was!
Bad job with that.
Hey, everybody, sorry to interrupt-- okay, weird picture--
Just ran into a lady who was supposed to give a marketing lecture here. She said she was accosted in the elevator. Yeah, a skinny nerd tried to push her into the wall, failed, then started crying, and offered to cut her a four-thousand-dollar check to keep the whole thing under wraps.
He said he didn't want everybody to know he was a punk bitch who couldn't even yoke up a forty-five-year-old dame with a heart of cold.
It was you.
Late.
Six hours late--
I know where you think you're going, the Olympics, but you're not.
Why don't you say the reasons you think you're going to the Olympics, and I'll say the reasons you're not.
No plane ticket.
No event tickets.
You don't have a legal passport or birth certificate to travel anywhere.
Yeah, you do, and you're clearly not opposed to buying shit because I bet that costume wasn't cheap.
Why would you ship that American costume internationally?
So what happened?!
Where do you get confidence from?
Where do you get your confidence from?
Can you not hear me?
You're always wrong--
You're always wrong--
Yet you're overflowing with confidence!
Go home.
Fine.
It would've been a bad gift.
What.
How was that gonna be my birthday gift?
Yup, here we go, first tweet: The sun is shining, the grass is green, and guess what's for breakfast? Anything is possible.
How is this a gift?!
Feel stupid about all of these tweets! Especially this one that says I'm from the USA but I'm voting for Rice. That's not fun or positive. That's just a bad tweet that you made.
Go to the Olympics!
England.
I guess, what youth group?
Stop yelling weird shit at me.
You know what, I'm gonna call bullshit on that one too.
Wow, how many of you guys did he promise a kiss from Michael Phelps?
Awful.
Yo, you're watching Jake and Amir.
Come on.
Alright, thank you for coming in. So the internship here is-
This isn't a couch. I said you could help me conduct these interviews if-
Leave.
What's your biggest weakness?
You know, you wear glasses.
Leave, quick.
I think it was both.  Because you said You'll never work in this town again and then you boxed her ears.
Whoa, whoa!
You legally can't ask that.
It's definitely not.
He really did.
You know his name on his resume says Michael Fink.
You're a dumbass.  Why would Shia LaBeouf need an internship?
What are you talking about? You're just trying to act tough in front of someone you think is Shia LaBeouf.
Get-
I don't think you should do that because we don't know if she's qualified yet. You boxed her ears pretty much right away.
Yeah! So you go to-
Just drop it.
He said green.
I agree. I mean, why ask that question in a job interview.
Yes, ask that.  What is wrong with you?
What's YOUR favorite color.
THAT'S CREAM!
THAT'S CREAM and he left.
Thanks for watching Jake and Amir!
Watching.
Flew a kite this weekend.
Soo sick.
Wow, expensive apartment.
Hey that's not gonna work.  It just won't work.
Business center?
I don't think you did.
Where is it?
Oh, god that's sad.
You know what, I'm on the site right now, you can't afford any of these apartments.
Bad.
Drop the business center.
I guarantee you, you're not.
Hang up.
Why do you live in a trash heap?
I have no idea what you're saying. Ever.
Great.
Old song.
Take it.
Yeah but they hung up when you said go fuck yourself to them.  Don't you have anybody that you can live with?
No, I don't. Hey, no don't do that. Don't shoehorn that in then act like I said yes.
Jesus Christ.
Why do you want to keep that a secret just between you two?
Why do you say his name this much?
Make your phone calls in the conference room from now on.
Oh my God, what happened
So how does that make him a coward?
No, I'm not gonna take anybody's side. You guys are just at my desk.
Oh.
You know that actually is something you could apologize for.
How did he do it?
So to your face then?
You know I can't believe that because you just told me he didn't do it to your face because he was too much of a pussy.
What word? Pussy?
You're saying it.
You say it all the time.
Fine, I won't.
I'm not. I stopped.
Don't make it a dance, I'm not gonna say it.
I didn't say it.
Why do you need a revenge fuck? You cheated on your fiance.
Weak dude!
You told her about the Olympics thing?
I-I'm still in awe of that fact.
You don't look that old. You're what?
You know what, I don't wanna interject here but Cheryl it sounds like you're in the wrong.
I'm sorry, I had a shot at that?
Ok this is ridiculous. You know what, Todd's a bitch. He is, he's a real bitch. Everything that you've been saying just, I can't even believe he did it, that all that stuff.
I really do. You know what else I believe?
He's Dr. Seuss, and I'm Shel Silverstein.
Equal? What are you talking about? You think Green Eggs and Ham is better than the freaking Giving Tree?
Oh well I'm saying it's not a freaking contest. Babe Ruth and Joe DiMaggio were both baseball players.
Yea but which one's bett- you know what that was a weird comparison.
Hey you know what don't answer it. Lets me and you, we'll go to a bar or something, we'll get a drink, we'll pop thes-
Have either of you had sex before?
This isn't gonna happen right.
Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir.
That's fine.
Hi! Yikes.
I'm not looking.
There's no need to wink, that was insanely forward.
I wasn't looking at her pussy, man!
Hey man, am I really early?
Wine.
It is, yeah.
Sorry. You want me to run back to Trader Joe's?
Wow.
Uh, yeah I guess
Stop it.  What are you even doing here?
Since when?
Is this still a date? That's still happening, right? This was all supposed to be a double date.
Put clothes on! Why are both of you still naked?
What?
How do I look?
All I heard was handsome, okay?
Hey! You must be Neko. I'm Jake. Um... I just met you,  and this is gravy!
Fuck! What are you doing?!
You went to a bodega and got gravy, for this. You're the weakest link.
Yeah man it was really quick, but you obviously didn't finish showering. Can't imagine you shit.
You call this getting ready?
Holy shit dude, you're proposing! This is insane! Wash your hand! When are you gonna do it?!
After we leave?
What?
Single date.
Easy does it. Easy does it.
Red wine coulda worked with that, right?
What?
Yikes man, a lot smaller than the slider.
You guys can't hook up in the booth.
I--... just met her, so I wouldn't know anything about her dietary restrictions, right?
Okay, I saw it, put it away...
Good save.
That's not on me, right? ...Buddy? Okay.
Hey-- you guys know I can hear you, right? This was not my fault--
You know, that's not hot. Your hands probably smell like fish now.
I'd have to sign up for an account.
Yeah. You know what? When I go home tonight, I'll sign up for an account.
Not this second, okay?
It's not gonna let me do it from my phone.
This is insane, that you're making me do this.
Okay. I'm on Pinterest. Here, just re-pinned it.
Fuck what? Dinner? The date?
Are we still on a date? Is this even still a date? Because I'd feel like I was missing out if Neko had said anything to me, ever! Neko! ...Neko! Come on.
Why not?
This is my account! These are my pins!
'Ey-- Weak!
We're not popping shirts, and that's not the phrase.
Hey, I brought that.
Jake and Amir.
Wow. ...Mean joke.
...I'm down for a peck, but, uh... only if it's cool with Neko!
Get off me, you wench! Neko, you just witnessed an assault.
I'm a hundred percent down to not play--
Weak. ...Okay. That's um... That's a re-spin, right, Neko? That's a re-spin.
...Why?
Dude, take that off. Take it off.
Fine. One, two, three.
There, dude. Are you satisfie--
Oh! Neko... Neko, help me!
Stop it, dude! Make him stop it... What're you--
Dude, I want everything to stop!
What the fuck was that?
Outside. On the balcony, right now.
Look, man, Emily is not the right girl. Alright? I don't know if Emily is into me, or if she's just... generally insane, but... I-- I just-- I just-- I don't think you can propose to her. Okay?
I-- I mean, this night has been... insane!
Right?
I think we're gonna be better friends for it, though. I really do.
Whoa, dude! No!
No they're not.
I-- I mean, this night has been... insane!
Right?
I think we're gonna be better friends for it, though. I really do.
Whoa, dude! No! No. No! Stop it!
...What the fuck was that?
That was illegal!
That was illegal, man!
What do you mean, following your heart?
You tried to kill me!
If I didn't wiggle out of that, man, I'd be dead right now.
Wack? What're you talkin' about, wack?
Murder.
Exactly! That's death-height! That's a death, dude!
...What?
You've been standing there the entire time? Why didn't you try to stop him?
Dude... Man, he tried to kill me...
What're you talkin' about, you didn't mean to?
I kissed her, man... but I was drunk on the grig'...
Aw, too much grig'...
Ritratti...
...What?
Look, you guys: I'm out of the game, okay? Trust me.
Okay, hey-- Hey. Okay, I'll do it. I'll propose to Neko... It's not like she's gonna say yes.
...What?
...No!
Emily, you're okay with this?
How many rings do you have?
Bad.
What is happening? How is this real?
Ow-- Ow, my eye... I'm blind, man! I'm blind and I'm engaged!
You're watching Jake and Amir.
Don't. Ow!
I already acknowledged you.
Morning.
You too.
What are you doing?
Oh my god. Are you kidding me? Are you serious right now? You're an adult! You're a grown-up and a you're doing this.
This is some really elementary school level shit, buddy.
Still be pretty immature then, right? Since you're almost 30?
Your nose is bleeding.
Okay, well you know what, if thinking of opposites makes your nose bleed, I'd advise you not to partake in Opposite Day.
Or at least go back to school. Try to make yourself smart.
Fine. I'm just gonna leave you with one final thought: I have a vagina, you have a penis.
Nah, sorry man. Today, I have a tiny little vagina, and you have a big ol' penis.
Great, I got that all on camera.
So it's not Opposite Day anymore.
That was everything you said.
Right. So definitely I am posting that video online. That's why I took it.
No.
No!
Wow.
I'm not taping anything.
Are you kidding me?!
Wow, low self esteem.
Not another scroll dude
No!
No!
No! Use your own name!
You sick fuck! Use you own name!
It's actually 2012 and right off the bat first up on your top 10 date ideas is sort of a cop out so you don't have to choose one
Not that good of a joke
Great!
So on your first date you want to take a cross-country drive with a stranger and then spend several days in wine country with them? That's like a nine day excursion buddy-
Stop doing that!
That's disgusting
Weird. Not a date
Why do you write everything on these scrolls? Like these ancient treasure maps you seem to have?
That is the second time you've: 1) gotten the year wrong, and 2) avoided choosing a date spot
Have you done that before?
Another road trip?
Fine.
Too much, too fast, way too soon!
That's more than an answer. That's a contract.
I don't
That last one is not a person. By the way, these are all still first date suggestions, right?
Bad way
Okay
Well what?
Why do you do this? Why do you stay up at night in your apartment making these weird lists? And you know what, even if you get some kind of perverse pleasure out of writing the lists, why bring them to work, and read them to me, when I don't like it?
It actually wouldn't have sufficed, because you said: Thought's on the list? That's not a yes or no question
It's a bad list. It's a bad list and you're a bad person.
Hey you're watching Jake and Amir!
They are.
Bad vest.
You know what buddy, 17 wasn't fine.
Uh, I'm Jake--
. Are you... C'mon.
I'm a writer here--
Paul just said to say what we do with the company.
You did! Where did you get that vest?
I won a spelling bee in forth grade.
That doesn't make any sense.
It's actually not.
Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir.
Don't say anything.
No, no, nononono, no!
Look, listen up everybody, this is the guy that sucked my dick.
Okay, Amir held me down...
And you blew me.
What are you even doing here man? Milk men don't exist anymore!
Yeah that song's about how they don't exist anymore.
He had a weird goatee type thing.
You know my name?
He's had a series of different occupations.
You know what? Tell me this. What's your name? The guy that sucked my dick was terrible at coming up with names on the spot.
Okay what is it?
You look pretty proud of yourself.
It's definitely you.
All of your milk is expired!
That's not how cottage cheese is made.
Who here is buying expired milk from you?
Pretty expired.
What are you doing? He needs a doctor!
No you're not!
Why would I have milk?
Ooow, fuck man, my nuts!
Polaroid pictu-
Me and your father aren't proud of you.
We're disgusted by you.
Alright. I'm gonna call 911 then.
Hi, 911? Yeah I have a dicksucker here in the room with me.
Yes I do! And he's operating on my friend, who has food poisoning.
it's not that big of a deal, 911 just says we have to induce vomiting.
NO! No more milk!
No more milk.
No!
Give me the milk!
He's trying to say book.
Yeah, 911 says that's insane, don't do that.
YEAH, 911, HE STABBED HIM! THE COCKSUCKER STABBED MY
You know what, you're not doing what you said you were going to do which is spit out his fluids. Ok this is insane, they say to just punch you in the stomach.
A shoe?
No you didn't, you didn't do anything except give him expired milk and stab him with a straw.
911 is the real hero. Hello sir, what is your name? I'd like to thank you personally... Charles what?
Wow.
Jesus Christ dude, what happened?
Does this have anything to do with the 319 Emails I got when I got off the subway?
So it's not that hard to be sure, right? First email from you came 49 minutes ago. Anybody want half a bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich? I tried to finish it but could nay get 'er done. I'm full as a kite and I just might stop to eat you out.
Not really. You respond to your email Here ye, here ye, did anybody hear me? This is an amazing deal, get it while she's NOT. Kevin responds I'll eat the sandwich if you shut the fuck up. And you respond to that I'll shut up if literally everybody in the company tells me to... Gangam Style.
I know.
211 emails in 30 seconds, which means a bunch of people told you to shut up twice.
They actually did, because you respond Yeehaw, partners! Didn't realize y'all hated me so much. Owie Zowie. But, not everyone told me to shut up twice, therefore the email thread, unlike Murph's grandmother, lives.
Hell yes. I guess people stopped responding to the thread and started talking to you in person, because your next email says, I've had it up to here with people coming by my desk and being mean to me.
I don't know why you guys have this mob mentality, but you sheep need to learn how to think individually.
Yep, saw that. Your next email, Who's the coward bitch that stapled my neck? I blinked for a second and I missed you, missed you, now I gotta kissed you. Make yourself known. Rosie responds It was me. and I guess you had to retaliate in some way, because your next email is Who's the prick that threw that brick at my head when I went to hit Rosie? Be a man and fess up to the crime so that I can do the time. Owen Parsons responds It was me. And you reply, 9 minutes later, Who's the loser who tripped me when I went to staple Owen's neck? I tripped and almost hit my head really hard, that would've been a lawsuit for sure.
Yes, I imagine it was, because you sent out another email.  I was just hit with another fucking brick. Are you shitting me with these? That makes 3 bricks on the gay. I don't know where you guys even got these things or the audacity to hurl them at me at such close range-- are you not full anymore?
Why are you still typing these emails?
You think this is diffusing the situation? Y'all are gonna have to bind and gag me if you want peace and quiet around here. And good luck, because I'm got going quietly. Your last email, sent 30 seconds before I got here, is obviously typed with your face, it's just MMPHUSFISDMPH. And then somehow, in perfect english, Gangam style.
C'mon dude, hasn't he suffered enough?
Ok, they're throwing bricks.
I didn't say that.
Take off your costume.
Please don't. I saw you come in here as a pirate.
However, you saw that I was in a mustard costume, panicked, then sprinted out of work. You came back two hours later in this.
I think nyarr as well. Where did you even find that costume on such short notice?
Right, can you please not talk in limericks?
Did you call on a bomb threat to my little brother's school?
Don't say exqueese me.
I'm saying, don't say exqueese me anymore, OK?
Yeah, and I'm saying if you don't understand something I said, say excuse me-
or what.
The other night, his entire dorm was evacuated at one AM because somebody called in a bomb threat, and as he's filing out, he got a text message, from you, that said It's me, it's fine.
You know what? Don't take matters like that into your own hands.
Can you take off that costume? OK? I don't want people to think we coordinated this.
I know.
Yeah, I mean, I guess so.
Come on, dude! We just turned a corner!
Watch this video until the end to find out how you can help!
Did I give you permission to go into my refrigerator?
Yeah, why did you bring that?
Yes.
That piece of ham is an example of a perishable food and I asked you to bring non-perishable food.
It's the least amount of food you could bring.
You ate some of the ham!?
No, because people need water!
Oh my god, you're selfish.
That's a well-known fact.
Great, I don't accept the ham.
You're kidding me. You're crying right now?
You're beefing?
Beefing over the ham?!
Throw it away! It looks expired!
Right, I was worried it was a week old, not twenty seven years old!
Why not just donate online?
go to redcross.org  and you can donate there  What?! Why?!  Why not?! Why won't-
Yeah, I saw the kick-starter you launched! Amir Blumenfeld Foundation  for not giving a shit!
What good is that gonna do?
Do you think you answered my question?
What does that mean?
What Amir?
Are you ashamed?
Just like feel negative about-
That's not really an expression...
No the shame on.. You should have brought spam. The joke would still have worked, it would've been a non-perishable food. 'We goin' spam'.
Okay, I'll tell you what, I'll give you five dollars to leave before you go give it back to me and I'll donate it in your name okay?
When did you donate water?
You piece of shi-
Hey guys, thank you very much for watching our video. I know we made a lot of jokes but you can actually help by going to redcross.org - don't touch me. - donate online or if you live in the tri-state area, you can donate your canned goods, water and batteries.
Nobody's thinking that! You piece of shit!
Oh My God!
Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir.
Shut up.
We're started, it's in the 2nd quarter.
There it is, there it is.
Yes, they were.
It's a wing.
Dude, it's a buffalo wing.  Relax.  Eat around the bone.
Do NOT hit me in the forehead again.
Not right now, man.
This team is doing fine.  You know who could use a head coach?  My ex-girlfriend.
She's crying.
It's a commercial.
Yeah, dude, it's Tide.  It's not the other leading detergents.
Yeah
You touched the beer on top of the table.
Yes, okay, yeah, alright, let's do that. KELLY: Well, alright, let's go.  VINCE: Oh, right, let's go.
Hey, everyone tried to change the subject.
Okay, we get it, thank you.  Stop it.  Settle down.  Shut up.
Oh, come on.  Yeah, come on.
Hey, hey, hey, hey Kelly, come on, it's not worth it.  Kelly, get it- come on, come on.  Move your neck away from her.
What the fuck was that?
You guys know what today is.
Leave.
Because you made three jokes, and they were all about dicks. Okay, it was offensive.
What if everybody thought like that?
A president wouldn't do that.  Oh, worst face you've ever made.
That's not good, man, homney's not a word.
You're not smart.
People are talking about Mitt Romney. You were just talking about Mitt Romney.
Remember Smitten Homney?
It was not funny.
Okay, we know you're busy, but you gotta find-
Stop, stop!
No more slam poetry. Okay, that was really good but no more slap poetry.
You gotta be as well-informed as possible, so research your candidates before you head to the polls.
So get out there and cast your vote for your candidate todate- today. Today-
Perfect.
It's fine if you were blinking.
Diday, diday, today.
One, two, three,  So get out there and vote for your favorite candidate today-
You know, you weren't blinking before, and now you just did one with your eyes completely closed.
Even if you were blinking before, that's fine.
Alright, let's try one m-
And you've been standing there for, like, seven!
Candidate.
Don't say today, it's messing you up, okay, candidate.
Come on.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Candidate.
Alright, so if you're over the age of 18-
You know, if they didn't register then you actually can't vote.
That was hot tea!
Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir
Oh my god get out
Well this was supposed to be an intervention, but i guess no one like you enough to show up.
Don't act smug, I know that hurt.
I mean both. You've been rubbing everyone the wrong way for the past four or five years.
Not coy, it's not coy, they hate you
What kind of interventions do you go to?
Impossible, I didn't have an E-vite for this intervention, I just decided to have it last week.
That's not a goose noise
I don't know, Penis is still pretty bad, I mean dickling is awful
That's the nicest thing he could have called you.
Wait a second, films?
You know I really hope you just misspoke.
Okay, I don't think you're right about either of those things.
No he's not!
No
We don't have a CD-ROM drive.
Meaning they're old and out of date, we don't have one.
It's a telephone.
Books
We'd We don't have one!
How is that relevant?
What are you talking about?
We have a DVD player!
It plays DVDs, are you serious?
Meaning it plays DVDs
Probably, just put it in the DVD player, okay, we'll see.
Insane!
Unplug your nose, you asshole.
O-oh my god!
Hey, alright, I'm going to call 9-1-1, okay?
I'll call it from my phone.
Well, I'll just tell them you legitimately burned your face this time!
..did you?
What?
...no.
No, I didn't. I said what.
To see if I wanted to agree to the favor!
Don't tell me what I mean.
What are you talking about?
And I said no!
Yeah, fine as in don't bring in the soup.
Stop telling me what I mean by shit!
Have you already forgotten that that is what happened?
What plan, man?
Wrong.
You're wrong. Go on.
Well, I'm well aware that you hate yams.
Stop saying yams.
Look, if you really did this just to recover at my house, if you're that pathetic, lowly, and masochistic, then...y'know what? I almost do feel bad enough to have you...
What are you talking about? Yes you do! You poured the soup on your face!
Yes, it is! Everything's about you! You're the most selfish person I know!
Unfair? You prank called 9-1-1! You took emergency responders away from people who actually need it!
Oh, you'll eat the yams.
I'M Jake, YOU'RE Amir.
*starts strangling Amir*
Hey ladies, you're watching Jake  Amir.
Shut up, dude.
Hey asshole!
Are you sad-der me.
Dude, these cords? Your fault. My pants are too tight, and that ain't right.
Oh, I can't wait to hear this story.  I'm all beers.
Are you done being a jackass?
No, no, I'm sorry. Jesus. I'm sorry.
What a tragedy.
Yeah, no, I can't believe a modern hospital wouldn't have cell phone service. I - I - I - I - I - I'm appalled.
Oh, it HAD cell phone service.  But you didn't respond to my text, so, your lies are catching up with you, Blumenfeld.  Hmm, I don't know.
How you gonna play this one, bud?
Cuz you were busy operating on her?  Cuz you're a PA or some shit? Are you a physician's assistant?  Or were you in the waiting room with your dick in your hand?
Then you had your dick in your hand, didn't you?
You were jerkin' your gerkin in the waiting room.
I bet a doctor would frown upon that.  I do.
You have got to be SHITTING me with that, dude!  You were on your phone? You were on your phone??  And you were ignoring my texts as they're coming in??  By the way, a phone tree works like this: You call one person, then that person calls another person and then that person calls another person.  Doesn't mean, like, everybody's calling you, making it so you can't respond to your texts, right?  It's some kind of reverse phone tree?  Were you the trunk?  If you're the trunk, then you got punked.
Don't play that card, you coward.  Okay, I sent you 12 pictures of myself in a dressing room, and it would've taken 3 seconds out of your day to give me a hell to the no. You know, even, going forward, how about if you ignore my texts, I'll know, don't buy the cords.
Going forward, I said.  As in starting now, and seeing as though I texted you yesterday, Lucy! You got some 'splaining to do!   If anybody heard that and didn't laugh, I urge you to reconsider.  Okay, I would take a pity laugh to save some face.  Speaking of face, why is nobody sucking on my face as I am looking amazing in these ill-fitting - slim-fitting! - cords?
You thought wrong.  A pair of roys for this lazy goy make the Jewish sluts say oy oy oy.
I butt-fucked my brother, on a booze cruise!
Of course I could. It's not exactly how I went to spend my Sunday afternoon, right, bud?
And once again, you choose them over me.
Yeah, but I know you're thinking about it, dude.  And tell you what, if you pick that up,  me and you are done professionally.   Another joke for everybody, that's Christian Ball ,  but really? Pick it up, and we're not friends.
Oh - oh oh oh oh oh oh yeah, that doesn't matter at all.  You still picked it up!
You c- you certainly did not.  You left this conversation, you had another one! Ok?  How do you think that makes me feel?
You s- you uh ew ah - please! You answered the phone, you said  Hi, how are you? I'm Amir Blumenfeld, I'm a piece of shit.
Then you said,  can I please call you back? Let me please call you back?  I bet you do call them back, too!
Alright, man, alright, we have to figure this shit out, ok? I'm sorry your mom's dead, but that's not -
You gotta be SHITTING me with that!
Nice.
Stop!
Sorry man....
Then you know what? You shouldn't have brought your rabid Rottweiler to Bring Your Dog To Work Day.
What are you talking about, She barked a bit? She killed two dogs! She ate two other dogs and bit a bunch of people.
Why do you think that everything that happens to you is the silent treatment?
No one is giving you the silent treatment. They just made and destroyed this You-Doll.
Who the fuck is Rotem?
You know what? Stop calling her a pup. You brought a crazed beat into the office. She attacked you, making you drop her leash.  You looked surprised and scared and you said, You know what,  'I can't deal with this' and then you ran off in a brazen act of cowardice.
You should fear her everyday, and I think you do because you locked yourself in a closet for two hours yelling, Shoot 'er! Shoot 'er! Shoot the bitch for all I care!' Meanwhile, she's out there attacking people, almost as if you trained her to do it. I mean, where did you get such an angry animal?
Wrong. You know the worst part, man? What animal control got there and told you that you had to put her down, you said, 'go ahead'. You didn't even go with them to the shelter to give her the  needle!
You couldn't be there for that dog?
Don't say, 'I couldn't' like you care, like you care about the dog. No, you just brought her to create chaos.
Stop saying it like that.
Yea,  you're not French!
Just go on with the story.
Oh my god...
Spit it out
Jesus.
Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir.
Come on.
Dude, you see Homeland last night?
I'm not going to say anything. I won't ruin it. It's insane.
That's a spoiler? That's a spoiler?
Something insane happens every single week!
Maybe- Someone dies a lot.
I'm not saying they did. I'm not saying they did. I'm not saying they did. Maybe they didn't.
I know.
No. I'm..
I don't like what just happened.
Okay? I'm serious. No, it wasn't just that. You said, Can I have a bite, Daddy? You called yourself Daddy.
No, it's not a joke. It makes me feel uncomfortable.
I'm not- Look, don't worry. We don't have to have this conservation. I'm just saying.
Yeah, no. All of those are examples of things that are unacceptable, actually.
Fine. Bro may be the one that works. But calling yourself my aunt?
Stop. It doesn't. I don't need a list. All I'm saying. It doesn't have to be. Don't make it a thing. Don't make it a thing. Why are you getting so angry? Why are you harping on it like this? I'm just asking you not to call yourself daddy.
Yeah, I'm gonna leave. You made me uncomfortable. You made it weird.
Wow. Really? Right now you're gonna say- Oh God. Dude, I didn't think it was. Don't make it a sexual thing.
You saying that makes it kind of a sexual thing.
No, I'm not trying to put that on you. Oh my God. Just...Drop it. Just drop it.
Why don't you just drop it?
You're harping on it!
Oh my God.
Look at the veins in your neck coming out right now.
You always get so stressed out. Just- Dude, just let it go.
You said something that offended me and I'm gonna leave. That's it.
Yes, I'm going to leave
Yes. I think I'm going to go home. I'll work-I'll work from home. I'll email everyone and say I'm working from home. Not a thing, you called yourself daddy. Shut up dude. Yeah! Maybe I will leave! I'm going to leave. You know what I'm going to do-
With the yelling, you can stop it right now. I'm going to go home. I've lost my appetite. You don't get the sandwich. I'm gonna throw it away. Where is it?
How?
You're not even chewing it.
Hey! Happy new year! You're watching Jake and Amir.
No.
Hey can you not fall asleep right now? We need to talk about that disgusting habit that you've picked up.
Really? Have you checked recently? Because according to the news story that I saw, it involves sticking a funnel inside your asshole, and ingesting alcohol through your colon.
How about you never say that again in the office.
That is what you did last night at my new year's party, but do you think you were drunker better than anybody? because I think you should up blackout drunk at seven P.M., in half a tuxedo, just the top half, you were naked waist down. You had a glass champagne flute stuck inside your butt, and you were dancing around singing "happy new queer".
You're talking about shoving blended fish inside your butt, then yeah I bet it does.
We all know what you do, ok? You ruined New Year's. When everybody was counting down you bent over and farted Vodka onto the TV.
Yeah you definitely killed the mood when you slipped and fell and shattered that glass Champagne flute inside your body. We took you to the hospital but the doctor refused to operate on you. He said, in the long run it might be better if you just die.
Is that what you do with Tic-Tacs?
Why?
So you graduated to dick chugging?
Woah.
Bad.
Terrible rhyme.
How did that make your final draft?
This isn't a final? Why are you reading it in front of me?
Is there a right way to funnel? If there is, I bet you don't know it. 'Cause why else do you have those shards of glass inside your anal cavity right now?
So not butt chugging.
Definitely not doing that with you.
I think what I'm gonna do is e-mail Paul...
...and ugh, see if I have the permission to send you home, or if he will. Um, you need to not be here today.
I'm gonna tell him the circumstances and see if I can send you home.
Really?
That's illogical? 'Cause I think getting your anus wounds untreated, leaving the hospital saying: "Fuck this quack, you're a hack", I think that's illogical.
That's not fair? What you're doing to your body isn't fair.
Three of your top ten haven't even been alcohol. One of them involved shoving a straw inside your dick. I mean that's self-mutilation bud, and I think all of them will kill you.
No.
I don't mean it. Are you done with the list?
Please not now, not here at the office.
Oh no! Ah!
Wow.
Okay, guys, Texas Hold 'Em is the name of the game.  You know the rules, there are two blinds-
Buddy, I told you you could go home.  It's a half day, you do NOT need to be here.
I cannot believe you write that down.
You're leaving.
I probably COULD physically force you to leave.
Okay, look, you could stay, under two conditions.
Let me say what the conditions are and you might be so insulted, that you decide to leave.
You can't talk.
No speaking...
...laughing, doing anything to disrupt us, and you're not allowed to uh, play.
Yeah, sorry,
So you're talking right off the bat.
Did you talk it? Because I said no talking.
You're a moron.
So you're not buying them.
Why?
Okay, you were just narrating that entire thing.
Okay, let's just play.  Uh, Stella, you're small blinds.  Streeter, you're big.
You know what dude, that's enough, you can go home.  Cuz  I said no talking, and if anything, you're talking more than you usually do.  You seem incapable of even having an internal monologue.
Why would I agree to that?
Wow.  Sure, yeah.  I'll take that.  Go ahead.
My milkshake brings all the gays to the yard, and they're like I'm gayer than y'all, ye-
I'm sorry!
Wh-whoa whoa hey hey-
I did it.
Dude, were you really just taping me right now?
Okay-- well, I-- you know what? Give me the camera, alright? 'Cuz I  need to-- erase that-- footage...
I thought you said the moon was in trouble.
Jocelyn! If--
--If I go on this space mission with you, if we can save the city, then...  you promise you'll let me... delete the footage of me touching my idea... stick, right? To get the enemy intelligence!
All right, Jocelyn. What's the plan?
Great idea, but... pretty cold down there. You sure the reactor's not indoors somewhere?
Dude, relax!
Here we are at the river, and, uh... fortunately, there's no nuclear reactor, so I guess we should, uh...
Aaah, no. Dammit, we're... we're foiled, 'cuz... the river is too... frigid, and... polluted and filthy to... to go in...
You know what? You know what, dude? That's it. This is  fun.  That's what this is! This is b--  fun.  And you know what? I'm not having any f--  blackmail!  This is not f--  blackmail!  Not for me.  It's  what best friends do. This is  what best friends do.  You're a  fun.  guy! You're a piece of  fun.  You are  a good  friend!  You are  a good  friend!  Alright? I'm serious.
...Just keep rolling, I'll jump in the river.
Okay, we have to get back to my apartment, now.
Did you get it?
You... definitely deleted that footage, though?
Ey-- no. No!
Hey. Go away. Go to your food.
What're you doing here, man--
What's the matter man. You're not happy to be thirty? You having a bad birthday?
Jesus Christ.
Wrong.
You don't have those things.
Well why all this sadness? Why now?
I don't know, bad.
So I wasn't wrong.
What would I love about this?
Yeah, that's pretty mean for a 12 year old.
Ms. Nesbit?
I said Ms. Nesbit.
Just read the letter.
Yeah, I know him.
I've met him. Several times.
You're adding love to the end of it.
Did you grow up in Buffalo?
What?
God, what a traitor!
I feel like every time we have a conversation I just, I get so sad for you.
There's no one behind me.
Hey!
Uh, two please.
'Later.
Hey, man. I'm sorry. I cooled off. It's just I really hate when you make those jokes. You know?
What's going on? Did you make this girl cry?
What? Why?
Woah.
What was your time?
How long was your run? How long did it take you?
4 PM.
It's 4 PM.  That makes you like 6 or 7 hours late today.
I'm not an idiot; you don't know what time work starts.
You're not smart?
You get angry easily?
You also seem incapable of going with the flow of a conversation.  You have like some sort of agenda, you're going to make your point no matter what I contribute.
You had a lack of zero compression pants?
What?
If it's a hundred dollar bill, then they accept it anywhere.
Have you actually started exercising?
By buying those clothes?
You know, that's not even a stretch, that's the macarena.  You can leave, or you can get to work.
Cool, man, I'm sorry to hear that.  What do you want me to say?
Why would he be proud of that?
I guess it's funny that you're having this realization in compression pants.
No, man, I was making fun of you.
Don't thank me, I was being mean to you.
Yeah, that's him.
Is he dead?
Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir.  This one's for all the pretty girls out there.
What?
Don't worry about it, man.  Hooking up with babes is like second nature to me.
Drop it, okay?  You can't poison tonight with your negative energy.
You know, I always said a woman's place was in the kitchen...as the head chef...at a 5-star restaurant.
No, no
Call an ambulance.
Hey dude, 3 o'clock.
Doesn't matter.
You know, then it really doesn't matter.
Just, forget it.
It's to the right.
Other right.
Wow!
She's gone.
Leave the bar, buddy.
Door's the other way.
Nice.
Hey...I made a bet with my friend here.
He bet me I couldn't talk to the prettiest girl here -
shhh - and get her number.
Awesome.
Fine. Fine.
Oh wow, I'll just cancel my credit cards.  Bet you didn't think of that, dumb ass.
Whew...you know what, that's almost a deal-breaker.  Oh, wait, no it's not!
Submerge it for second base.
Worth it!
I hooked up!  I hooked up!
Barkeep, come on, I need a bag of rice, stat!  I have to get my phone in rice in the next two minutes or she's a goner.  I know, cuz I've lost 6 other Iphones to that cruel mistress.
Hey, if you think this is sad, you should read my diary.  Every single day reads like a fucking suicide note.
Yeeesh. Hey, I'm engaged, sweetheart.
No, sorry, you know what?  Don't answer that.  Cuz either you guys are gonna tell the truth and hurt HIS feelings, or lie and hurt mine.
Congratulations, friend, what's your name? What's your number?
You know what, you have the least popular opinion in the bar.
Yeah, fucking right!  How so??  How so??
This has been the highlight of my year.  What a ride.  Come here.
Can you, sorry, don't make that noise, cuz it makes me feel like shit.
Don't worry, buddy.  Happens to me all the time.   Hey, barkeep, we need a glass of whole milk.  Okay, my friend here just had his mace cherry popped.
Okay, absolutely understandable.  I already hooked up tonight.   That burns your nostrils if you inhale it, dude.
You shouldn't be doing that.
No it's like illegal. In New York. To smoke in a building.
Why do you have one of those?
And one of the things you wanted was a tiny fan?
How are you rich?
Nevermind.
I said nevermind.
I dunno. Two dozen?
What do you think I said?
When you asked me how much is the perfect amount of Almonds, what do you think I said?
Billions. Tens of Billions of Dollars.
Zero dollars.
Both. Zero dollars.
Don't put your hand up like that.
Put your hand down, that's... irritating me.
It's like
Yeah, it's like you're challenging me. Your interrupting me as you want me to speak and it makes me angry.
I don't know. Nothing?
Right now it's a photo of you, holding a single walnut.
It's not.
I'm jealous, ok? I'm jealous I didn't think of onealmond.com first because I think it's a great idea and it's gonna be worth billions. I'm just being negative cause I'm jealous, there, that's it. Let's drop it.
Yeah.
What's going on?
Walnut.
Sit down. Do not come over here to spank me.
Sit the fuck down dude, you're making me nervous.
GET AWAY FROM ME DUDE!!!
Hey Meryl did you get the day off yet? For your the uh... the pregnancy? Oh man, I'm high.
Yeah, right man. I love indie movies. Like, um...there's this one called Momento. That I really dug. It was like...Everybody says it's backwards, but personally, I liked it.
I'm on a date.
How on Earth is this a double date? You didn't bring anyone.
I didn't say-
OW!
Will you stop. We know you.
Yes I have! You always make up some weird name.
You know MY name.
What is it?
Yep.
Yes.
Sue-Lue Candles?
That's not a normal name at all.
Scar-Jo's not bad! You know, if you took out Scarlett Johansson your name is just Penis Anal.
Your dad bit him on the ass with his legs?
Ow.
What the fuck did I just watch?
No...
No, no, no, no!
Get away!
Wrong.
No it's prounounced 'hero' still.
That B wasn't silent-
Actually I haven't!
Hey! No!
Not funny.
Get your head out of there!
I don't know-
Bad line.
I don't think that's official, you need a priest or something.
No, I don't think that's the insult you want it to mean-
Still not official-
Stop! Stop!
Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir!
How?
There are 68 games, there are way more than 100 possible outcomes.
I didn't say fook you.
There is no write-in candidate.
You have Mickey Mouse in your Final Four.
Hey! Stop it!
No it's just that you've filled out--
When do you do this?
When do you come up with these shitty rhymes?
Ew!
I know that's what you think.
People had it. I mean, it was a long shot, but at least it was a basketball team.
What?! What did you just say? Say it again.
You crossed them out.
You don't have Butler, you crossed them out. That's where you wrote Mickey Mouse.
No!
Not quite buddy. A dunce, a prince, not quite.
You talk, hoping I'm not listening?
You don't like that pick?
I get it.
I get it!
What?
I'll change the pick!
How do you know so much about 2003?!
You still have MICKEY MOUSE winning it all!
That's nice.
No.
Morning, man.
No. No, okay?
Tell you what, dude... Just give me??give me the.. child, and uh... get out of here. Leave.
I don't care what day he was bjorn . I care about his family, okay? His mom and dad who miss him, and??
Don't.. do that, man.
It's actually starring Matt Damon.
You're thinking of Contagion now.
Bjrn Borg.
Stop saying "bjorn." You know what? I'm calling the police. I feel like I've been doing this way too much recently.
Doubtful.
Wow, they didn't even need to pick up. Sir, I can and will testify against this.. criminal.
You heard the man.
What?
What's going on right now?
You sure he didn't just take advantage of the situation in order to steal your baby?
I just got this text message from him five minutes ago. "Hey dude, jacked a baby on the way to work. This is gonna be hilarious. From a cop, no less. A little piggy."
Sure thing. Yeah, you know what, in fact, anything I can do to help. I always wanted to be a police officer myself, and uh, I guess this makes it official??Hey! Come on...  God...
Holy crap, that was so??that was, like, insanely easy for you, huh? You are strong as shit. This is like??that's a 4 so that's a heavier phone, there's a steel band, I mean??holy wow, that is...
Dude... go take your son back.  HEY! OW! AH!
I'm not a perp! Deny him! Deny him!
NO...!
AHHH!!!
What?
It's not.
Son of a bitch, I'm not wearing any fur.
You're wearing fur! You're wearing a lot of fur! Fur coat! Fur hat! That's??Yeah, that's a mink scarf!  I see it!
You know, there's also a dead iguana in your pocket.
It's a dead iguana.
What animals do you think I killed to make this sweater?
Paint.
Oh my god...
Stop it! Your wallet is a dead rat!
I'm not trying to be clever; it looks like you cut open a dead rat. Maybe it was alive when you did it, and then you filled it with bloody money.
All right, you know what? I wanna know why you did this; walk me through your logic. Take your time. I will not interrupt you.
You're an asshole.
You know what I think happened? I think you got into the idea of owning fur after some weird conversation you had with your cousin Leron or some strange show you saw on TV. You became fur-obsessed, going on a morbid spending spree. And when you ran out of acceptable animals to wear on your body, your blood-thirsty raid took you to the deep, dark corners of the animal wear/ware kingdom, like that pocket iguana or your rat wallet. Either way, you reek of mink and rat blood! So go home!
No.
No, you can go home.
You know, why don't you at least admit that you're hot in that jacket right now?
You know, I also said that. That was my first guess.
Nobody loves you.. for anything.
No, that did hurt you; I know it.
Just move on.
Can you stop talking about strangling the iguana?
Are you wearing dead doves on your feet?
They're white.
Nope they're not...
DON'T cry and pinch me..
You okay?
No, what are you talking about?
The equal sign
IT'S A EQUAL SIGN, I'M RIGHT
It's an EQUAL SIGN yeah..
NO WHATEVER, did you really just not know what an equal sign was
It's like the first thing they teach you
Yeah it's fine, not everything you say has to rhyme
Okay, No, just no, you've got this entirely wrong
As you should
No...
Nobody has to get gay married
Marriage Equality doesn't mean I have to marry another guy
Mmmmm No it doesn't
You're the dumb one
No
Some people just don't believe that same sex couples should be allowed to marry
I'm not joking
I'M NOT JOKING
I know...
You're right...but...me and you...we're not gay...
yeah that's not gay you just wanna hang out with me all the time
Bad joke...
I just think if people wanna get married they should be allowed to
That's not how that works, and I think our marriage is a sham anyway because aside from meeting to agree to it I probably should have at least been present at the ceremony
Awful, Disgusting, Unofficial...
Don't try to shart, don't do this!!
It's not natural you're forcing it out
It's not a coincidence, your voice is...strayed
That was so much more than a tadpole, or a guppy
Hey Jake and Amir here, that might of been a silly video but it did have an important message
We all know somebody whos sharted
Support gay marriage
Hey, you're watching jake and amir.
Unnecessarily mean.
Amir.
Absolutely not.
I'll look after work, alright?
Don't get mad at me, okay? Work's already started, one, and two: fine, dude, take it back.
Jesus! Jesus! Fine! Fine.
You know, and just so you know, the thought of you brainstorming a gift, going out shopping for a gift, buying something and then wrapping it up with this little bow and sneaking it into work and hiding it in my desk...--
No, it's not great!
It really freaks me out, and I don't think you should do-  and this is a Rolex! It's a Rolex, buddy!
I've never said that to you before.. in my life.
You're an ass. You're an asshole! I don't want this gift from you!
Shut up dude! You just yelled "cunt" in the office.
Alright, you know what?
Don't.. hug me. No, okay?  What is this manila folder  Sketches. Photos. A VENN DIAGRAM. I mean dude, this is psychotic!
You wrote a teleplay... A full-on script about how you wanted this moment to play out!
You weren't at all! "Upon seeing the watch he's dreamt of but never described aloud, Jake cries tears of soy."? Is that a typo?
You wrote my name as "J J K A E" every single time.
"He realizes only his soulmate could've seen into his mind's eye and found his dream watch, the same one he never knew he even wanted."  "Jake is struck by the awe of this moment." You know.. that's too much scene direction.
Bad writing.
Bad me, I know.
Right, I said that.
I actually can't try it on, 'cause I don't know how many links you got removed from this thing, but it might as well be a ring.
Nobody has wrists this small; they'd be dead.
You know, I'm not sure you can, 'cause according to your script, you ripped up the receipt in front of the watch salesman. You said "What's your return policy? Because if you think Jake will ever return this, it's a fallacy."
According to your script he "cried tears of soy."
That's not a real thing. That can't happen.
Huh!
Oh my god, HELP US!
He's crying soy!
Tears of soy!
Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir!
No, they're not.
Hey! Hey, yeah, I was wondering if you could come to that meeting today.
Yeah, yeah. In the, uh... junior conference room.
It's at, uh, three-thirty?
We could push it to four...
Alright. Four's good.
Cool!
Yo, shut up, dude.
I'm here. Yeah.
Yo, you really have to be quiet.
Sorry, there's just this idiot yelling in my ear right now.
Alright! I'll see you there!
...What?
What are you talking about right now?
Do you think I said "bro" at some point? You're mimicking something you misheard.
..."bro"?
Okay...
Well-- okay, I guess I didn't get the suit memo. I'm sorry about that. Uh, why don't we just jump right in--
Get out.
This isn't your meeting, man. Leave.
I don't know where you got the impression that you were even allowed in this room, let alone leading our meeting.
Alright, I don't think--
--Okay, hey--
"Off with my head", dude?  G--
Gonny... Gonny, what are you doing-- I-- oh!
Ah! Okay! Ah, I'll leave! Ow, I'll leave!
I never said "bro"!
You don't have to do it backwards.
Alright, I think I'm gonna work from the conference room today, so--
...Okay?
What are you talking about?
We've worked together for six years. Do you really not know my email?
Art in your head?
That's less money, okay? You really think Mark Zuckerberg wants to steal and then sell this photo of you... planking at a candlelight vigil? ...I mean, I don't even know what the vigil's for, but I think no matter what, it's pretty depraved!
Allen Ginsberg.
No! No. You ass.
Who is? Who's stealing from you?
W-- what are you talking about? What do you think you agreed to--
They would never buy anything from you. You think they have any interest in your status? "Going to the mall? Nah. Going to the mall high. Like this status and I'll smoke you out."
That's not quirky, cheeky, or irreverent. It's not even humor.
Don't ask me about the British Office.
You're comparing your desperate wannabe-stoner status with one of the most beloved sitcoms of all time?
That's it, dude! That's it! Do something more important with your day.
...Holy shit.
Holy shit, what are you saying?
Okay, yeah!  Everybody, actually, while you're here-- this is good-- gather 'round, 'cause Amir's gonna delete his Facebook and Instagram!
"Hah?" No, right? You found out they've been robbing us blind from the get-go! He's figured 'em out, so he's decided to take the moral high ground and delete both accounts.
No, really! I really think you should do that. Delete both the accounts, right now.
...Oh my God.
You're an adult man. You're a grown-up; a fully-grown person. Jesus, buddy!
Okay! I'm sorry.
Okay, so keep it!
Dude, come on. Stop.
I think I'm gonna work from home today.
...Rick Fox?
From who?
That's... just-- that's Josh.
What.
...That chicken's fine.
Oh! No!
Why are you even here, Rick Fox? Did you come to steal more money from Amir?
Didn't say she was. You shouldn't have to clarify that.
Doesn't sound very honest.
Eggs?
I'm not.
He brought a chicken to the office!
Fine. Fine, what have you spent your entire life obsessing over?
...Omelettes are eggs! Omelettes are eg--
Nothing! Nothing, okay? I'm-- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I don't want to! You're scaring me, Rick Fox!
What's happening right now? Is that chicken over there your wife? Is that what's going on? You sick fuck!
Jesus... Thank you. Thank you, ma'am. I'm glad that I'm not the only person here who thinks this guy is completely--
God. She's crazier.
Whose face?
You know what? Fine. Omelettes are eggs. Omelettes are eggs. It's a fact.
What are you talking about, "being named after" chicken?
No, chicken nuggets are made of chicken. They kill a chicken, grind up the meat and then shape it into nuggets.
7:45 PM, the All-Nighter starts in another fifteen minutes, and it goes for twelve hours.
What? Where?
How are you this tired already?
Dude, wake up!
I think that might make it less than legit.
Do you want me to get you some coffee? Maybe that would wake you up?
What are you even talking about?
Why did you tell it there?
Can you please try not to rhyme all of the time?
That was unintentional.
Wh-- you didn't even give me time to laugh at that! You knew that would fail.
I-- I think we should ask Sam if you can go home.
Yes, I would.
...What?
He's half-asleep, dude. What do you mean "what did he just say"? It doesn't matter.
I didn't say that! What are you talking about?
So do I! I'm half Jewish--
Ow!
...That was anti-Semitic, what you just said!
What are you talking about--
Hey! Ow! Ow, quit it--
I'm sorry; I think he fell asleep, so...
Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir!
Get off of me.
You're wet.
Oh snap! What it do, my dude?
Twenty bones!
You got that bud for your bud?
Ooh-oooh!  You mind if I test the product?
Oh, come on, dude. Okay!
Mmmm. Oh my goodness, mmmm.  Oh, mon, dis dat Jamaican shit, mon! Huh?
Okay! Uh, and to get high on it, I'll just, like, sprinkle it on a doobie?
Okay. Cool! Dope, man. You wanna smoke it with me?
I'll hit you up after work.
Hey-- ow! Ow ow!
What are you doing? Stop it!
That means you wouldn't be arresting me.
Okay-- hey-- you made the handcuffs too tight, alright? Untie me. Seriously.
That's my wallet, and my iPhone.
...How?
Where did you even get these plastic handcuffs?
You just answered my question.
How and why?
That you survived.
It's a little bit of weed! ...You loser!
Bull-shite! I only smoke the dankest reefer.
Hey-- gimme the phone! Gimme the phone--  Officer? Officer, I am blazed, high, stoned, and gone! I need a slap on the wrist, and some munchie snacks! Yes. Yes, Your Honor.
Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir!
Can you not eat in here?
Hey. Hey, you're in a YouTube video. And-- ...you're an asshole. Oh my God, you're an asshole.
I think it might go viral; it's you trying and failing to jack an iPhone on the subway.
No, it's actually not. I can see very clearly: this girl is texting on her iPhone and you just rip it out of her hands; you try to time it just right so you can get out there before the doors close--
--but no. You thought it was a good idea to turn around and say  "time for you to disconnect permanently", and then wink at her.
How did you think you had time for that?
You should give a damn, because here you are running around the train like an animal, like a scared rat, trying to burrow your way out of the door, large crowds just forming around you, and then you... you lay on the ground; you start kicking and screaming. I mean... listen to this.
Right, except finally when someone does press the emergency brake, it just gives the gang that much more time to beat the shit out of you! ...That's not smart! ...That wasn't good thinking!
...Like, leaving my house, without my shoes--
Of course!
Okay, focus. Okay? 'Cause four guys are just sitting on your limbs right now, laying you out like a starfish, while every single woman and child on this train is... they're taking turns stepping on your face!
...You're so hated, buddy!
You are a zero!
You didn't get a free iPhone! Eight people are carrying you to the front of the train right now, laying you at the feet of the woman that you robbed, making you not only return her phone, but... God, lick the bottom of her shoes, which... you almost seem too willing to do.
It's not "kinky"--
What the f-- ...they're taking out your dick?
Hey... hey, they took out your dick, they s-- ... they molested you, bud.
You can sue these assholes.
Hell yeah, I think you have a case! This.. herd, with their hive-mind and their mob mentality.
They-- they think the train's under their own martial law?
I mean, they're...  they're taunting you! They're flicking your dick, taking turns, and-- and videotaping it!
That's a disgrace. If it's a disgrace, then you've got a case!
He's got a case.
Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir!

That's a disgrace. If it's a disgrace, then you've got a case!
He's got a case.
Don't do this.
So they are get rich quick schemes.
You said they were "wet bitch thick creams"--
What is wrong with you right now? Don't yell; catch your breath.
That's just money.
That means you lose money.
You have to chill out, okay?
I guess.
That's not where I thought you were going with that--
Oh my God! T--
I'm not talking.
How does that get you money?
I didn't call you anything.
How is that a get rich quick scheme? Sounds like that would take years.
Don't touch me, dude. I'm dead serious right now.
Why are you this out-of-breath, by the way? I mean, like... you look like you just ran a ten-K.
That cannot be on your--
--list. There it is. "Pay me to eat a weed."
You okay, man?
You want me to call a doctor?
That's actually really smart--
Want to take a break?
Alright, I'm gonna take you to the hospital--
Don't do this.
So they are get rich quick schemes.

No, no no--
--if I'm gonna fuck a dude, I want it to be, like, a really, really tiny dude-- basically like a woman in the dark, you know? With a really tiny little dick, just like double-crankin' it,  get him-- get him off, right away--
Like-- like this!  Just double-crankin' it, and then it's done!
Yeah. That's--
L-- you mean like you! You want yourself!
Yes, a bear would fuckin' love to fuck you.
Ohh. Oh, that's nice--
--Yeah, yeah. I want a kicker.
"Boiling hot spum"?
Oh my God.
No, no no--
--if I'm gonna fuck a dude, I want it to be, like, a really, really tiny dude-- basically like a woman in the dark, you know? With a really tiny little dick, just like double-crankin' it,  get him-- get him off, right away--

Oh my-- you suck.
You know, I'm trying this new thing... where I ignore you, to see if that makes you--
Can you please not read to me from that flimsy, shitty little scroll?
What are you talking about? Are you sad?
Are you okay?
Fine. You know what? That one's nice. Stop reading the list. I responded to one; I'll follow it--
You absolute monster, you're talking about poisoning your family.
You depraved lunatic! Okay, you're talking about calling an ambulance in front of your dying family, and then not giving the EMT team the directions to your house? You'll-- you'll go to jail for that! I think you'd go to jail for even writing that!
Great, so your "plan that won't fail" is to publicly bribe a judge,  in a court of law, with a task that could easily do himself?
So in some miraculous turn of events,  the judge actually accepts your bribe in this fantasy world, and the way you repay fate for giving you this awesome favor  is by being too lazy to rake a yard?
Holy shit...
Okay. ...Okay!
...I think you need to die.
Yeah.
It's been six years, and you're getting worse. Okay? I think the world would just be... an infinitely better place if you weren't in it.
No. You shouldn't be allowed to breathe.
Please finish your life.
Be dead!
No, you're just crying.
Okay, well then you're sobbing.
Okay, why don't you just go home, okay?
Just because I made you cry, you think I cast a spell on you?
Okay, I was kidding, alright?
Holy shit.
Jesus.
Oh my-- you suck.
You know, I'm trying this new thing... where I ignore you, to see if that makes you--

Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir!
Get off of me.
You're wet.
Why? What was funny?

amir: And enough said!
I didn't say anything.
Yeah, you know what, I guess you don't.
Jesus.
Are you really crying again?
Yes! OK, you are 30 years old. People are married with kids at your age and you are crying, okay? You-- you don't wear the best clothes, by the way. You are currently wearing a pair of khakis that you shit in over a year ago!
Wash them!
You self-centered piece of shit.
Prick.
You are a microscopic fleck of dirt, dude!
You are awful, you are an awful ugly person.
You have ears.
You know, I am not talking about your physical appearance, I am saying your attitude is so negative that it makes you an ugly person.
What if I just told you that you have swag? Would you stop talking then?
You have swag.
Yah.
Cool. It's fine.
Quiet.
You are welcome.
A few seconds ago--  what the fuck was that?
Go ahead and finish it. I'd love to see this, yeah.
Does it feel like you have swag?
That's an infected nipple!
Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir!
Oh my God. Your voice sucks.
You asshole.
You unbelievable dick!
Swallow your food.
You just Rickrolled an email thread of people planning a funeral, man!
It's a meme.
...Why not?
Is that a risque comedy?
Don't open his email, everybody.
You know what's not cool, is you replying all to this email thread where we're mourning and planning Amanda Ferri's funeral,  and saying, "I think these flowers are wild and playful, much like Amanda was. I believe these dragon lilies capture not only her essence, but also her spirit."  "They're a tad bit on the pricey side, but she was more than worth it." And then the link is a Rickroll.
Will.
Focus.
Excuse me?
What did you just say to me?
...And that's okay?
"Sleep well, my sweet angel"? You sent that yesterday, and she died three days ago.
Yes you did.
The email that you sent, on the same exact thread!  "I'm so sorry to hear about Amanda. This is more than a shock; it's a downright shame--" that's not more than a shock, by the way. It's just different.  Then you continue: "If you need to smile in this hour of need, I urge you to read about this meme I found called Rickrolling."
No, it's not. You continue: "There are many funny videos online of people being rolled by Rick at inopportune times... actually, that gives me an idea."
Oh!
Aaah!
Aaah!
Aaah!
Aaah!
Oh, it got you!
Aaah!
Aaah!
Aaah!
Aaah!
Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir.
Stop it.
You know the only reason we're on this bus is cause you got us kicked off the train for pretending to be a conductor.
I don't know where you get this false sense of entitlement, but you also can't afford shit.
He had an Audi?
Like he used to own an Audi?
What you did was a felony.
That's what they would do!
You stood outside the train yelling "all awhored," and then once the doors shut you said "Everyone listen up this is an emergency, there's Anthrax on the train, take off all your clothes."
You're a goof.
You're a goof?
Hey, hey, that's a toddler dude!
You know you're currently on the bus, which is, you know, not a great place to brandish your eleven dollars.
What are you listening to?
I GOT IT.
The police showed up and you said you were a Jon Stewart type comedian making a point about subway culture. You said you were a political activist rising up against this see something, say nothing bull sheeite. A mix between Che Guevara, Bam Margera, and Dom Irrera. And then you said "I'm part of the sixty-nine percent." And when nobody laughed, you started crying.
I know what that is.
You're a bitch?
Fine.
This says "Urinals are for pee-pee, toilets are for doo-doo."
It's a bunch of drafts of one liners. The last one being "I'm the sixty-nine percent."
Yeah! Yeah it is, I can't believe you thought this said fine.
You know, can you really not just sit still?
I told the officers you had a personality disorder, and they almost let us go but then you stole a billy club and hit a policeman in the shin with it. You said "Score one for the Hurwitz brothers! If you don't like our power, take it from us with brute force." That's when we were both tased.
I know you were there.
Ok, fine, I'm-
HOW CAN YOU START CHANTS THIS EASILY?
Time's up.
Hey--
You just rhymed "star" with "star"?
Does he really?
You know you have an actual job here, right?
You're probably right-- also, how does having an Instagram make him a quadruple-threat?
This is my desk.
You know, I think you actually like when he sees you like this. I think you get off on it, 'cause you act this way every single time Mike Fink-- by the way, not Shia LaBeouf-- comes to the office.
Don't do that.
Why do you think he's Shia LaBeouf? Why do you think that?
You're mispronouncing it.
What, 'cause Will asked for an autograph?
That guy eats his own shit.
How so?
This is so inappropriate for work!
Will you please let Mike work?
You're not a vegetarian.
I didn't say that.
What's tasteful about kissy-kissy and then going to anal?
Anal.
If anal is tasteful to you, what's "the big one"?
Hey, Will, what were you eating?
It's always bleeding.
Ass so frat, we sat at the frat, we back to the frat, we sat on that ass, we back to the frat!
I got a bid! ...That's what I'm doing!
A bid is a ticket! A ticket in! I'm a goddamn Greek god now. Okay? I'm pledging a frat.
First of all, can you not do me the disservice? Don't do me the dishonor, the disrespect of calling it a "frat"? Okay? It's a fraternity. Would you call your country a cunt?
Traitor!
Did I? Did I for real though?  ...Don't tell my Bigs. Do not-- dude, I'll suck your dick.
No, I will.
Secondly, being in a fraternity is the highest form of brotherhood. It gets you made, paid, and-- oh yeah!-- it gets you laid.
...Sorry?
It gets you laid, I said.
Made.
P-- You know what? It gets you paid in pussy. Yeah. That's what it does. Liquid pussy. That's currency in my frat. Okay? My fraternity. You got that? Have you ever hooked up with a sorority girl?
Well you know what? Pretty soon, that's something you and I won't have in common.
Holy shit, you really don't get it, do you? Upsilon Upsilon Upsilon doesn't believe in hazing, okay? They believe in the bond, forged by brothers, committing acts of courage for one another.
Eat socks, chug a bottle of absinthe 'till I puked, get whipped on my ass, wear a vibrating dildo around my neck for an entire day, call my mom, tell her my brother was dead, call my brother, tell him I was gay, and me and a bunch of other pledges had to hold each other's dicks in a basement while we walked around like elephants. It's called the elephant-walk and, uh, this elephant wishes he could forget.  I also ate six banana peels--
Because I'm not allowed to question why! Because our bond is tighter than the glue they used to seal my asshole shut before our Triple Chili Challenge. Okay? Because Upsilon Upsilon Upsilon is a global... brand!
Yeah!
Still hurts! Hasn't stopped hurting! It's a third-degree burn, brother! But, um, I can think of something hotter! It's a sorority girl's ta-tas! And-- they're on my ya-ya!
Why not?
Shit! Dude, that's Dick-Tooth. Give me your phone, quick!
'Cause Dick-T threw it in a river!
No! It's two different people, ass! Give me your phone, or I can kiss my bid goodbye!
It is I: Hur-bitch. I am your humble servant; you are my proud master. Your word is my command. You letters are my brand.
I feel bad for you.
Swallow it.
I'm actually not interested. And that was very foul.
You did when you said "money".
You absolute ass.
You jerk.
How does it save me time or effort? It costs both of those things, and you know, for most people this involves overcoming some kind of moral obstacle.
You say that like it's a good thing; it's a very bad thing. Alright? You're endangering people's jobs.
What's going on?
Jesus!
You know what? It's fair because it's all your fault! You did this to yourself; you're-- ...dude, you're robbing airlines!
No.
Don't. Please.
Don't turn this into some kind of noble cause, okay? You're incapable of having an idea that big.
You're a small-time crook.
Yes, I've seen Erin Brokovich, and you know what? She brought a small town to its feet and a corporation to its knees. You, sir, are no Erin Brokovich.
Stand up.
Stand up. I think I need to fight you.
Yeah! Uh--
...put up your dukes, I guess!
I know it's ridiculous, but I think it's finally come to blows, man.
Aaah! Ass!
Boo! Boo, right? Is that not a "boo"?
Please don't.
Guys, I know Amir gets on everybody's nerves, okay, but... he's up there trying to share a talent with us, so... that takes some level of courage, I guess. Let's just give him our respect--
Nope. They're right. Boo. Leave.
Awful. Mean-spirited, small-minded, homophobic, hateful, slanderous, thoughtless, careless--
They're not doing that.
You know that's Central America, not South.
You just urged everyone else to applaud.
I think that's, like, the definition of "fair", buddy.
Sorry, "no other talents"?  Your winner's right here, 'cause J-Witz knows how to beatbox!
Okay, that's it! Will, a pound of your shit. Right now. Get it over here.
Oh, you're a dick.
Wow, saw that.
I regret it. And you know, by the way, we're not actually traveling together. I went on a work trip, and when I got to the airport I went to baggage claim and you came out inside my duffel bag. Coiled up in there with two dislocated shoulders, nearly frozen to death. You whispered, "Surprise. Help me. Help me."
What did I say that was nice?
You okay?
Turn on the light.
Turn on the light!
I'll just turn on my light.
Pretty sad actually, that you're viewing this as a challenge.
Did you think you were pulling the metal faucet of a bed?
Why are you in it?
Just turn on the light!
So we can go to bed, you idiot.
Don't do this.
Oh, god. Bud? Bud? Bud!
Oh my god, you sound like a different person.
My bed. This is my bed, get out, you're wet.
Why are you opening a drawer?
Are you okay?
Ass.
Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir!
That's it.
Nope.
It was, like, three seconds.
"Gumming"?
Ow.
No.
No.
Oh, my God! Are you kidding me?
You can't hold the remote, because last time you did, you ate one of the batteries.
You know what? I will remind you, because you were blackout drunk! You put a battery in your mouth, you washed it down with an entire bottle of vodka from the minibar, and then said, "I'll take that free ride to the ER now!"
You know they can tell what room you're calling from, right?
You know, when the doctors X-rayed you, they found more than one battery. They found five or six AA's, a nine-volt, and an entire roll of copper wire.
That's the terrible joke you made on the operating table to deafening silence, as the nurses sawed into you.
You should be dead.
No!
No.
Just apologize!
"Got 'em"? Really?
You just cried in front of a hotel clerk for thirty minutes 'til he got bored and left.
Not enough time.
Not enough information, then.
That's great. Alright. Thank you very much Liz, we're gonna definitely be in touch.
Well yeah thanks again, and could you just let the next person know that we're ready?
She's still close enough to hear you.
Bad english bud.
You never come to these.
Great. Thanks. Bye.
Wow.
Maybe, not necessarily. We're gonna call you.
Oh my god, there's actual shit on that bud.
How?
That's not what that means, and ya know what dude, can you do us a favor? Please, can you not tell every single girl that they got the part? Because we're the ones that have to call them, and tell them that they didn't. Besides, I wrote Elton John Blows Papa Smurf, okay? You shouldn't even be here.
Alright.
What?
What did you just say?
Nope. Don't clap. He said it in a cool way but he couldn't be more wrong.
Hey, you're watching Jake and a-OHH AHH YOU'RE BITING ME!
I'm bleeding!
What.
No, do- I didn't start this conversation.
Alright man, that's great, and no, no you didn't, you posted nineteen hundred times in the last day. Most recently, two seconds ago, which means you were posting as you were lying to me.
You know the last thing you posted was in the subreddit Earth Porn?
It's not a good thing, so. Right?
It's a picture of Yosemite Valley at sunrise, you commented "How is this Earth, and how is this porn."
Yes, your face on Ron Jeremy's body's fucking a map of Africa. That's Earth Porn to you?
It's definitely not!
Everyone who thinks you're an asshole for posting mean comments and linking to porn? They're a circlejerking diva, and nothing's wrong with you?
Fred Durst?
You're a loser, man.
Yeah.
Right, I see that post. Picture of you from a webcam with your dick tucked between your legs? The text on top reads "Saw every Michael Chiklis movie" text on the bottom reads "Went dickless for him." You posted it in a subreddit called Jake and Amir! You know I don't approve of that.
You're absolutely not.
You're a scumbag steve.
You know, you also post a lot in explain it to me like I'm five. Your last three questions were about money, crayons, and eating. Most five year olds understand crayons and eating. A lot of them understand money.
How is this helpful? Under your eating post, somebody wrote "OP is a dumbass and a loser. Just let yourself die."
You wrote "How does it feel like to make a thirty year old cry? Gentlemen, shower this d-bag with d-votes."
They gave him eleven thousand upvotes.
You commented on his post "I'd make you eat my dick if it weren't already off for sir Michael Chik. Ask me anytime." Did you even set up an AMA for that?
Yes. Yes you do. And, how do you have your dick off for someone? Explain that to me like I'm five. And why would you do it, if you're gonna do it, For Michael Chiklis!
If you need a little encouragement, why don't you look at the front page. Where it says "If this post gets ten thousand upvotes Amir Blumenfeld will kill himself."
Got a hundred and fifty.
Thousand. Upvotes.
A hundred and fifty thousand. For you to kill yourself.
Like they want you dead. Yeah.
Okay. Of course. Yeah? A little tears?
Crying?
Sobbing?
Thirty years old though?
Almost thirty one?
Alright.
Yeah, it's on the front page but you-
Yup.
You're happy.
Hey you're watching Jake and Amir!
When you're in here
...what?
I heard you the first time it doesn't make any sense.
Jesus Christ!
I didn't ask one.
Beady eyes, chipmunk cheeks, buck teeth, bad skin-
Know what man- stop saying that alright? I never had a problem with your nose.
Ooh!
No man! Come on! You're nose is gone! Where did you get surgery?
Yes, I know your cousin Leeron.
Wait a sec, Leeron's gay?
Just saying, like, he has kids-
No- I didn't- alright-
Can you-
It doesn't freak me out-
You know what, I don't have a lot of soul searching to do
You know what freaks me out? Your face freaks me out-  AMIR: You have to look yourself in the mirror and you have to say: do YOU deserve children?
What happened, to your face?
I won't.
Gas?
...No... How is that legal?
Aaaah! Thats sexual harrasment!
It hasn't already gotten real? You were clubbed in a van by a guy named Parm.
Shower, burn the chair.
Was it worth it?
All this destruction.
This carnage...
Yeah, was it worth changing your stupid nose over?
You still stabbed somebody! In his eye, right? And- by the way- why would you let a blind person operate on your face?
Sorry, how old is Parm?
Your cousin dated him?
Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir!
Get out.
I'd say so; looks like your nose is falling off.
You're not nice to anybody now.
...What does that even mean?
Yes.
Then you know what? You're the jackass!
Why do you think you won the lottery, jackass?
Can you please--
--not pick at that?
Okay, well just let it heal!
How.
...No?
You know you're holding two?
It's two.
That's not three.
Yeah! Because you know what--
--winning the lottery is, like, one in two hundred million! What are your numbers?
What are your numbers?
What are the numbers? We'll check right now to see if you won. First ticket. Go.
So you know what three is? Right? 'Cause that one's got three, this one's got two-- you know what? Forget it. You bought multiple lottery tickets with the same combination?
There's not. What are the numbers?
Jesus Christ, you won.
Please, this isn't fair! Alright? You have to understand-- this is the most insanely lucky thing that's happened to anybody, ever.
No, it wasn't strategy! Okay? Just-- jump up and down, be happy, at least act shocked. Okay? You noseless ass!
Yes! Obviously! It wasn't thinly veiled!
Great, so they don't match right now.
Can you please just focus on getting your face better and stop scratching your nose?
Hey-- hey, it-- but-- no, there's a family of spiders crawling out of there.
What?
What?
No.
You sold a couch?
Never mind, alright? I don't think I want to know.
Why?
What do you mean, "Why what"? You just told me something really mean-spirited and weird that you do, so I asked you why.
Weird? It makes you borderline psychotic!
I'm not gonna answer your phone. The dish is clean.
She asked if you were being cute with her?
No you didn't. I'm sitting right here. That's not what you said.
You suck. You really do. You suck; you're not a good guy.
Yes! God does forbid this! Your reverse prank-calling people, and your fucked-up bait-and-switch with these evil mind games. Using a work phone, by the way! You don't even have the Goddamn courtesy to use your cell phone?
Right, I get that, but you shouldn't be spending this much time and effort just to piss people off.
Why do you think I'll answer it?  The bowl's clean.
You are.
Jesus.
You know what, that's not a riddle, and did you do one work thing today? Did you answer a single email? Why'd you bring that bucket--
You know, you left him a key. That's not exactly trespassing.
You say "Mickey" so much when you talk to him, it's crazy.
You're watching Jake and Amir.
Get out. Get out! Get out!
"It's a bird, it's a place"?
I don't care what's "good for Oppa".
Yeah?
Yeah?
That's a Ben Franklin costume, man.
You crammed so much wrong into so few words.
How do you think that's a compliment?
...'Cause you don't have one? 'Cause your idea of cool is either mean-spirited or dumb, and deep down, you probably hate yourself more than anybody hates you?
Nope.
You weren't.
Why are you laughing right now?
How?
How is that a two-person costume?
You know, your crotch is bleeding.
Why all the costumes?
No! Are you insane? Go home; take that costume off right now! You're going to get shot!
Yes! Jesus! Exactly! Wipe it off! Shower!
That's perfect. Go with it--
Just the first one.
I just came over here to try to find some peace and quiet--
...came over here to try to get some work done, alright? It's the one quiet place in the whole office.
Never mind.
I really don't have time right now, okay?
Oka--
Fine--
Hey--
Ahhhh--
Oh God... where's my tongue, man?
He killed me, man...
...Where's my tongue--
Where's my tongue...
Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir!
They are.
He gets paid.
Okay. For the record, I did answer the question, unequivocally.
So you think he did the ad... just because he loves pizza? Not because Papa John's paid him money?
Forget it 'cause you're dumb?
Stop saying "ass" so much. Okay? You're using it as a crutch, and it's not as funny as you think it is. Just... go back to being the needy weirdo that you used to be. Alright?
Are you concerned?
Alright, so Derek Jeter rides around in a Ford Escape. Do you think Derek Jeter loves Ford?
Focus on something different, for the day.
Stop it--
--just-- stop! What did I just tell you--
Money! Absolutely, he got cash for that!
I resent you pointing at me.
You couldn't possibly know.
...What?
Peyton's smiling in his ad too!
Don't say it.
The mystery is not solved. Alright? You think Peyton Manning's maybe smiling 'cause he got paid, like, a billion dollars for that ad?
--million--
Just shut up.
...Who?
...What?
What is this?
Excuse me?
Will, you eat your own shit. Yeah.  D-- what? What? What is that face? You eat your own shit. I think that's the idiot move. Also, he thought Peyton did the commercials for free.
...Forget it.
Forget it 'cause you don't know what the fuck you're talking about... ass!
You're the ass, ass!
Ass!
Ass!
You're wearing a dress.
Do you want to s--
Do you want to sit at your desk?
We just got breakfast.
Denied.
You know, I told you not to act so proud.
Alright.
What did I say? If you don't turn it into such a big deal, may--
See that? That's the kind of shit that makes me not want to get breakfast together.
Okay, you're still screaming. Alright?  Please, just... chill out. You're shaking!
I do. I care who knows it. And you know what? We didn't even eat breakfast together. I was in line at Starbucks and you stood behind me eating loose egg salad out of a plastic bag!
First of all, I didn't even call you a name just now. Second, you're not secretly depressed about anything. You're outwardly depressed about it. The barista called you "hun" and you started crying!
Why do you think she said "hum"? By the way, you name-call a lot, for someone who doesn't like it.
No, I know! I'm just pointing out how hypocritical you are-- close your mouth-- okay? You're dumb, and you're mean, and... and your nose does emit a humming noise!
Look how fast you turned on me. How quickly you went from happy to sad.  From calm to angry.  Is that normal?
I don't think it is. I think you should just try to be nice, and quiet, for five minutes in a row. Right now.
Yes. Fine. If you're quiet for five minutes, I will take you to lunch.
You lost it, Hum.
Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir!
Ass.
It's not raining outside.
Are you asking me a question?
Wow... okay.  Nice, bud.
Just make them sentences instead of questions. Statements, okay?  You're telling me a story; you're not asking me.
...Did you have it or not? I don't know.
Okay?
--"Amir"--
You know what? I-- you know, I appreciate the offer. I actually am just not that hungry.
No, I know it would mean a lot to you. That's one of the reasons I don't want to try the bread.
I wish you were less curious.
Right, of course. I know.
...Why?
Ow! Really hard.
This is chalk!
No, like this bread is legitimately chalk! I mean--  --look!
This bread is poison!
Like it? I can't even bring myself to bite into it! This slice alone is the density of a brick! I mean, it's amazing!
Never a compliment.
How?
No, I mean, like, how do you have this? How do you think it's jam?
No! I will not!
Excuse you!
Absolutely excuse you!
Wrong.
You know, turkey's a pretty important part of the holiday, pal.
Misinformation.
Wouldn't that still be animal cruelty?
I've heard of a wren.
Okay, that's more animal cruelty than is already necessary on Thanksgiving.
Sorry-- which one of those is a vegetable to you?
Yeah, you also said "strawberries" and "meat".
That's a root vegetable, b-- fi-- just... move on.
Oh my God, that's dark.
Pretty mean to wish that on someone else.
You know what? Stop it. Don't make me feel sympathy for you, alright? You don't deserve it.
Wow, man. That made me really depressed. You are... such a small coward.
What a sad way to spend Thanksgiving. Alone, eating McDonald's? Which doesn't sell Dunkaroos, by the way.
Did you know this was going to happen?
Pal! Easy with the weird death wish!
What? What is it?
Sorry?
...No, I mean "sorry" like... like I don't know you. We don't know each other. In life.
Yeah. We're not close.
...I don't know you, man, but, um... you know, what most people around here like you for is that you, uh... you're not a paranoid schizophrenic, you don't have delusions of grandeur, and you... use the toilet, when you need to go to the bathroom.
It's normal... understand? You are normal.
You sit on the other side of the office. Far...  far away from here.
I'm just really happy. Alright? It has nothing to do with you, but I think there's um... I really think there's a miracle happening right now.
You know what, man? I think you put on some... some weird loser's pants. Some small coward. Okay? But... but he's gone now. I think... I think luck, or fate, or God finally intervened, and I really think he might not ever come back.
I'm Josh.
Josh R. But you can call me Josh. And look, man, it was really nice to meet you, but... but please leave... Yeah. I have work to do. Get out of here.
You have to leave. Now.
You should go too.
I... I guess so... I hope so.  I guess so.
You asshole! Why'd you do that?
Go back!
Go back to where you were! You ass!
Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir!
Yeah, why would you say that?
Is that a first generation iPhone?
That's not a dating application!
Has it ever been a girl?
I definitely believe that! Your profile says that you're anti-abortion, pro-guncontrol, neonazi-liberal-lesbian rabbi.
What do you mean 'where'?
Oh my god!
Is that true?
...fuck my face?
You're such an evil guy.
Does it?
Did that work?
Sorry, who's this guy, that keeps on calling you?  'Ryan Don't Pick Up'?
The extra-marital affair site?
Yes! It is.
That's not a trick.
Sorry Sir, where have you been the last five years?
Okay-
Sorry...
Let's not.
Alright? We just found out one of our friends has to move across the country.
What if it's me?
Sure there is.
You said you had a good song.
It's just it.
It's just goodbye. And it's just it.
Wow. Yeah, you know, not everything has to be more than something, just to drive your point past home.
Yeah. A blast.
I do. I think so.
Blast you on a Tuesday.
I'll help you with your stuff.
Are you kidding me, man?
You were packing for an hour. You have no possessions?
A s-- yes! Exactly! You have a sandwich bag! You worked here for eight fucking years!
It's really light! You know, considering the amount of time you spent here, at this desk. No backpack? No bag?
You didn't pack at all! You packed--  --it sounds like grapes and raisins, mostly.
Right.  "Odds and ends", by the way, is not one word. You, uh... you spelled this more than wrong.
Man, that was lame. It was so lame. It made me uncomfortable. / AMIR: Ass, ass, ass for not laughing at that? It was a callback!
Okay. It's a deep pull.
Stop it.
I know it's hard for you to leave, but I thought maybe, uh... maybe we'll do something special, something real big, for our last hurrah.
Yes it does.
How not? You're moving across the country. You're gonna be in a different office.
So you don't know! I just said we're not gonna be in the same office! Don't yell at me that you know when you don't!
I'm trying to tell you that I'm gonna drive you to LA.
In that.
It's an RV!
Eight days of adventure.
Just me and you.
What?
...You piece of shit.
No!
It's twenty-two feet.
I'm not asking you to go Dutch-- you know what? Never mind, man. Just have-- have fun in California.
You're making it worse.
Oh!
More than nicked you!
Alright, stop it-- You're watching Jake and Amir!
Hey.
Got you water.
That's, like, a pint of 5-hour Energy. I think you should hydrate.
We're in New Jersey.
...Did that happen to you?
The map's upside-down and backwards.
We can't go to Morocco!
Alright, just... chill. Stop saying "anus". Will you name cities in America?
Not in America. Not a city.
Closer. Still not a city.
And you've lost it completely-- change your mouth!
Just-- name cities in between here and Los Angeles, okay? New Orleans. Austin. Vegas.
I get it. Okay? You're angry,  you're sad,  you're scared.  You don't want to move to Los Angeles--  alright, that's enough with the active listening. Alright? Just let me talk-- but, look, it's happening no matter what, so... all we can do is make the most out of the next week that we have with each other. So what do you say? You want to have a cool adventure, or what?
Alright, awesome.
I think you're pretty cool, and I'm down for this adventure!
I... appreciate your love. Let's hit the road, huh?
You're really hurting my hand at this point.
Alright. What would it mean, after all that, if I said I love you now?
That's... not--
A pint of sugar is making you higher, okay? Will you just chill? That's, like, forty-five hours of energy.
Jesus.
Alright, stop it-- You're watching Jake and Amir!
Alright, man! To New Orleans!
Cheers.
Not bad, right? Tequila.
Drunk, is what you're gonna be feeling, and I think you already are, which is really fast. Most people need more than one sh--
Alright, you know what? That's an eight-year-old boy.
Jump.
Yeah, you know what? That is a really big fucking problem! Okay? And just... stop being so honest. Alright? It's ruining my night.
Wake up.
Jesus. Just keep drinking the water, alright? Try and sober--
Don't touch me-- no. You're not funny.
Stop it! No, I don't laugh at anything you say when you say it. You think I laugh at something you said later?
He sounds like a piece of shit.
You know what, man? The shot that I gave you didn't have any alcohol in it. Okay?
That wasn't tequila!
Don't don't don't--
Alright, now we have to go to the hospital, 'cause you just blew a line of salt.
Who are you talking to?
'Cause you call them bitches?
'Cause you're an asshole.
Oh, my God! How do you have such saggy naturals?
A prostitute?
I think it's time to go to bed.
Alright, do you want alcohol or not?
Hey-- whoa--
Terrible accent.
Why did you do that?
I'm not gonna give this one to you.
Scorsese?
You had two, and then you failed to name Martin Scorsese.
Wrong.
What are their names?
You said "name".
Fine. What's your dad's name?
Ohh! Come on.
...What?
You can't even say the same fake name twice in a row! How impossibly dumb are you?
Really?
Okay. Bill Clinton. Bill Nye. I'll give you half a point for Scorsese, and half a point for two dads, one of them being yours, that you couldn't name.
It's still not a revelation. You don't know the name!
From what house?
You-- name the President, then! And the First Lady! Go ahead! Should not be hard.
How is it five?
That's a person. You could have named Hitler.
...Ace of spades.
Ace of spades-- and time. Okay? Time, I think.
You already asked for two seconds!
Another person.
It's right here!
That was impressively bad. I mean holy shit, it took you way longer than two seconds, and you never found the card!
How was I supposed to know what card you were gonna see first?
Alright, tell you what. I'll pay for lunch.
You know, you've named more people by accident than you could when you were playing the game.
Hey man.
Tell you what, man. I'll play again.
How about... four of clubs?
You're watching Jake and Amir.
She is grand.
Right, it's the same thing. You just said it twice. Okay, you know what? I think I'm gonna go, because I've been out here for two hours, while I can only assume you were back in the RV, rehearsing that line over and over again. I mean, at one point, it sounded like you were focus-grouping it in there.
We're in the States.
Bad note. Right?  Just so I'm clear, you spent two full hours storming your brain, and all you could come up with was coming out here and saying something negative, insulting this this, this, this national treasure, and your shithead cousin's one note was to add a cliche to the top of it?
...Forget it.
Don't you think at that point it's not acting like anything, you just are a diva roach? Like some sort of reverse evolution?
...Are you asking me if you know how to read? I-- I honestly-- I'm not sure. I don't know.
That's insensitive.
Alright. Okay.
You know what? We've got one more night to kill. What do you say we go to Vegas?
Alright. I mean, it's... alright. Yeah. Yeah, fine! Las Vegas it is! Alright!
No no, it's f-- alright, en-- ...tell you what, man. You're welcome. For everything.
Sorry-- the other side of this note says "fuck off, Jake Hurwitz".
"You rat coward, you only take me on a week-long trip and pay for everything? How dare you! Is that all I'm worth to you, you you you diva roach?"
Which one of us is the roach?
Bad execution. Bad idea.
We have to leave!
Yeah, actually, you know what? Excuse us. Can me and Amir talk alone for a second?
Lydia.
You know what, forget it. You showed up on the casino floor last night, drunker than I've ever seen anyone.
Yes, it was. You were wearing a leather jacket, a French beret, and nothing else.
Oh! Warts!
You jumped on the roulette table, instantly pulled your hamstring, but you decided to power through.
You said "I'm the maitre d'! Who wants fish and chips?" You pointed up at the rafters, like a weakling Babe Ruth, you pulled out a flounder or a... or a sea bass or something...
You tossed a thousand dollars' worth of chips in the air, and you hit it across the casino floor like... l-- like you were, like you were playing Tee Ball or something!
Then, you tried to charge what you thought was the mound, and you ended up hitting an elderly Walmart greeter on vacation with her dying husband. Closed-fisted.
I said flounder!
Security was called, but you were covered in fish grease, naturally, so you were able to slip through their arms. The pit boss announced a rousing game of "catch the slimy Jew", and a group of Asian businessmen bet against you, and won, when you ran full-speed, head-first into a Sex and the City slot machine.
There was a deafening crack,  and everybody started to surround what they were sure-- what they hoped, actually-- was a dead body...
...until you awoke mid-sentence, suing the casino, which I guess is when they upgraded you to this ridiculous suite.
No it didn't! Security took you up here and started showing you suite after suite, but it was clear that you had taken this... miraculous turn of events for... more than granted! You kept on claiming "none of these rooms are Mac Daddy enough!" Finally, in this one, you demanded to know whether the balcony was stable or not. When the concierge went out there, you locked the door behind her...
...and then, in a final brazen act of cowardice, you tried to set the room on fire. Unsuccessfully.
That is a bold question, but it is actually not fair, because in a fair world, you would be dead.
Finally, delirious with anger or maybe possessed by the devil, you barrel-rolled down the escalator back onto the casino floor, in nothing but an open bathrobe and a cowboy hat. You yelled "I'm gonna buy a blood diamond worth of blow! Who's coming back to my room with me?"
That's when Lydia-- who, I'm just gonna say this, 'cause you said I could say anything I wanted to in front of her: Lydia, I can only assume you're a garbage-can whore-- came back up to the room. By the way, honey, there's no blow up here. So I'm sorry to disappoint you, but--
What?  You said I could say anything I wanted to in front of her!
Hey- you're watching Jake and Amir.
Alright man. That's it. It's been fun...
Insane!
You wanna say goodbye?
You have a fun experience?
A good road trip?
Hey it's been cool working together, for the last eight years.
Do you wanna reflect? On anything?
Hey at least let me shake your hand.
Ok, I get it.
I'm gonna get out of the car.
You're my boy. You're my boy.
Relax.
Text me.
Not too much.
You forgot your odds and ends.
You keep it.
What are you doing? I put on sunglasses and you put on like the exact same pair.
It's like the idea of putting on sunglasses.
He just has them.
Listen to your voice.
Don't let it get to that octave.
It's a Rolex, buddy!
I've never said that to you before.
You're an ass, you're an asshole. I don't want this gift from you. You're- I'm- shutup dude!
You just yelled cunt in the office. How is that okay? Alright, you know what?
Hey! Hey! Come on! What are you guys doing? This is insane, it's no way to treat somebody on their first day of work. I mean I know you've heard stories about this guy from New York, but, but jeez doesn't he deserve a chance? He took a real big leap of faith coming out here and... the least you guys could do is give him a fresh start.  I know one guy in this office who will.
Yeah, I do.
Sorry, what?
Why are you saying that?
Are you kidding me? This is insane!
Oh, shut the fuck up. Alright, tell you what man, the RV is outside!
I can move back to New York.  AMIR: No no no no, I'm just joking.
You were just joking...?
You gotta learn how to give a joke, cause that's rude.
What I just did was really nice and then you hit me with the Rubi- you didn't even say thank you.
Back it up?
Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir.
No.
What are you talking about?
Why on Earth would you assume that? Didn't I make a pretty big deal out of staying here?
Holy shit, dude. I take one week off... one week off in the last eight years, and you're putting me on blast for that.
Printer?
Easy-- ...does it with the Air. Okay? It's a delicate device.
Is that a sentence, that you--
...I'm not connected to a printer--
How is that brand new?
So then the ink's not brand new either.
You know, there's a lot of mouse droppings in there.
What do you even need to print?
What?
When is the last time you flew?
Come on.
How is that your dime, then?
Hey, watch out, dude. There's a mouse in there.
Oh, no!
Hello, you're watching Jake and Amir!
Jesus.
Stop it. Do you even know what a Bitcoin is?
You're overusing your air-quotes. Why do you think Bitcoin is better than money?
Right, you're using that word wrong. A Bitcoin is worth four hundred and fifty dollars.
You know what, man? You are exactly what's wrong with Bitcoin. You and your speculator friends are just treating it like a stock,  hoarding Kingcoin, waiting for the price to go up so you can sell it to the next jackash at a profit!
Yeah, dude! 'Cause I believe in Bitcoin!
Um, 'cause it's the future of everything?
Oh, um, it's untraceable! For one! Untraceable!
Meaning it's worth more than cash! ...Jackash!
And, um, Pat?  It's digital. It's digital.  It is digital. Bitcoin's digital.
And, um, to my final point:  It is, um, an online cryptocurrency, Mr. Cassels, so, uh... Hurwitz! From way downtown!
Hey, Amir! Why don't you tell this pasty Jew what we do to jackashes!
Buddy... I think you should lift me up.
I just swished the game-winning three, so I think it's only fair that you come over here, lift me up like a champion, and give me your Bitcoin.
No I'm not!
What's your Coinbase login and password? We're gonna sign in, we're gonna move all your Bitcoin over to my digital wallet.
I did have Bitcoin, and it was in MtGox. It was hacked and now it's gone.  Alright, I made the three. It was from downtown.
Then let me down!
'Cause you let me down.
Very good.
You know, you actually have a soft spot in your heart because of fetal alcohol syndrome.
I'm serious, man. I read the doctor's report. Your mom would drink whiskey on purpose when she was pregnant with you. She wanted to terminate her own pregnancy.
...Who?
They didn't play Brigham Young.
What?
You kicked my tongue off!
Someone should arrest you.
For as dumb as you are, you're pretty good at rhyming.
"Fack it, nah"?
Yeah? You wanna say "fack it"?
Then get out! ...Why don't you get out? Leave! You say "fack it"?
Right?
You want to--
Well, they couldn't make less sense currently. You have in your final four Gonzaga, a picture of a porcupine, the number eleven, and jam.
Wow, dude. Try to work on these jokes a little bit.
...Time.
Yeah, dude, so you can't suck your own dick at all, let alone to completion, in less than three minutes.
Alright, stop it. Stop it. I win the bet.
That's it.
Oh-- come on!
Hey--
What?
It's not.
React internally.
Dude! Dude, dude! Do your work!  Answer emails.
Back-- he's from Canada. You just knew that.
What didn't he do?
That's it?
He's-- ...sorry, you can't deport someone because they annoy you.
You just said you didn't like them,  and wow. Buddy, you are a major part of the problem. Don't you think? You post about these stories all the time on Facebook! Your last one just says "Buck Fieber"... nice.
You know, you're giving him a lot of attention.
Of course I belieb that! That's very beliebable.
I think you might just have diarrhea.
Wow, you look sick.
Alright, yes. You definitely just have a stomach bug. Take up a real issue. Alright? Focus on something a little more important than this celebrity bullshit.
It's really old.
Yeah, you have the flu! You're pale, you're angry, you're dripping with sweat. Go home for the day.
Oh, that's a lot of puke!
Hello! You're watching Jake and Amir!
No.
I'm mad at you.
You know what I didn't expect or deserve? To be burned alive. Leave me alone.
I know the worst part. It was the feeling of the flesh falling off my back, after--
How can you ruin something in a good way?
Yeah, you know what, dude? I think I will remember this every April. I'll remember this every week, every day, for the rest of my life. I will never forgive, never forget--
Today got sucks when you scalded my back with soup.
Leave me alone, Murphy! Alright? My back really kills.
What? Why?
Owwwww, I'm sorry!
Ohh...
Yeah, he could hear me! Hear that? He said he could hear me!
Weak! I'm so--
Owwwwwww!
Man, this is so fucked! Even for you guys! ...It's too dark! I don't like this!
Good, man! You hear that? He doesn't want me to get hurt!
Owwwww, God, no, no! What's wrong with you, you sick fucking... it--...
...I feel... I, I... I feel no pain. What are you doing?
...Y--... y-- you still ruined my clothes.
...What?
Awesome, man. What's his name?
Jesus Christ.
You shouldn't have to clarify--
Nobody announces a name like that.
...I hated that.
I'm gonna go.
I'm outside, so, I'm good.
Did you forget the key?
You ruined a donut.
With a key.
Key.
Right?
Just a key!
It confuses him.
It's a donut--
God damn you.
What the fuck...? How did you do that?
Right, I know that's a joke, but I am very, very hungry.
I would have eaten that.
Alright, can you stop doing that? We're not in a townhouse.
Can--
Why.
How do you shit?
Sure.
Wait, a serial killer lived here?
What?
No, we don't.
That was in a cartoon.
How do you know what asbestos tas--
This place is disgusting.
Then we're not gonna see it.
"Juke and Aboot"?
...It smells great.
Let's move on. See the rest of this place.
This is a Foosball table.
Ow!
Let's move on!
Oh! In me!
Ah! On me!
You're a bad realtor, man.
Ugh, get off me! When did you get your license?
Just tell me the year.
Ah.
Did anyone say that second part?
Yeah.
Yeah. I think it's pretty obvious.
Yeah.
I think so too.
Are you fucking serious?
It's bad!
It's fun?
To live here, in a muffin?
Fine. Bye.
Where's the door? It's a muffin.
Jesus Christ, dude!
What are you?
Poster ideas.
Don't you think we're scraping the bottom of the barrel at this point?
So taupe is bad?
Stop touching me.
Pretty unoriginal.
Alright. Taupe.
That's the lowest I could rate it.
Don't touch me.
That's the only time that it wouldn't be beer-thirty. It would be ear-thirty.
...How dare you.
That's a really horrible face-- and none of these ideas have been original, okay? It sounds like you want to just open up a poster store.
God, you're a bad businessman.
That one's kind of funny.
Why am I here?
Alright, well, so don't say anything--
A mirror.
I didn't say your name. You're pitching me a mirror.
Taupe.
Is that a pitch?
That's entirely a drink. You just pitched me orange soda.
I don't care what you eat.
No, you're just always being a dickling.
Still wrote "amber".
I think you're has-ing a stroke.
That's all beverage. It's half iced tea, half lemonade.
It's a good idea, but it's not yours.
You?
God-- can I see your notebook?
Yeah, just page after page of drink ideas.
You think you invented milk?
No.
Zero.
Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir-- and watch out, dude.
Look--  ...Jesus.
That guy's walking.
Can you please just focus. Alright? I said I'd give you a driving lesson if you would focus.
"I'm have a pussy"?
Yeah, you've said that before.
Music doesn't help you drive, at all. You hopped the curb back there 'cause you were listening to a Big Sean song.
Be sorry that you just tried to lie, to get me to turn it back on! Okay? Y-- y--you gotta learn how to drive, if you're living in Los Angeles.
Jesus.
Jerk.
Alright, fine. I'll grab them. Where are they--
Hey, hey-- hey-- dude! Hey! Idiot!
You idiot!
Eyes on the road, buddy.
Find the glasses.
Oh! Smelly!
Jesus Christ.
...What?
I don't-- ...stop it. Okay?
I don't feel like having a conversation right now.
Good, so then we just be quiet, and we don't have to say anything to each other.
I can belee dat. Just, please, can we not talk about your family? I--
"Queen Dweeb"?
...The pit?
Why did you ask me about peach pits?
Jesus Christ, that is depressing. Just... driving-wise, okay...
Just remember to use your signals when we're changing lanes.
Eyes on the road.
So you said "less" twice, then.
...Excuse me?
God, your parents suck, dude.
Keep your eyes on the road!
Then take them off!
Hey! Dude!
Hey! Come on!
Nice one.
So you're not even pretending that you do work for the company anymore?
One of those is a hobby. The other is jerking off, and the third is just a sea creature.
Yeah.
Why don't you just do your work, for the day?
Don't point the s--
Alright. Doesn't look like you have a good grip on the shears there, so don't--  yeah, don't gesticulate with them like that.
Ten bucks.
How much did you spend on gardening supplies?
See, at this point, I know whatever you say is a lie--
--'cause you spent--
--too long.
Oh! Too green! That's infected!
I don't believe that-- hey, man, that smells awful.
...Terrible salad.
Ohh, don't! Dude, no!
That actually is horse manure!
It is it!
Fertilizer, idiot! You're eating fertilizer!
And it's shit! You're eating shit!
I did! I am!
Why haven't you spit it out yet?
...Jesus.
You can't masturbate in the office.
Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir!
Leave me alone, Murphy!
"Oh, hello. Didn't see you there. You know why? I only care about one thing: pussy, money, and cash. And I'm almost out of cash."
"Moira Slut, why don't you get on your knees and kiss my knees? Kiss my tiny little knees."
Is this sexy to you?
"Not even if I give you cash?"
It's clearly not a sex scene! We're not having sex!
On-screen! He said "on-screen", and I didn't do anything!
"I can't believe my eyes are rolling back in my head. I'm ecstatic to feel this. This is sex, and I am cash."
Ohh! No, dude! No! Come on, dude.
Look, get away from me, Murphy! Alright? I'll sue you, dude!
Oh God, my knees! My tiny knees!
You're not playing.
We're not keeping score.
Two more.
No. No, no. Dude.
Stop, dude! Stop it!
It's not a hint-- right! Of course not! We hate you. Leave!
Excuse me?
Jesus Christ.
You missed it!
No you don't!
You broke my tooth! You didn't score!
What are you talking about? No he doesn't! Redemption shot, from way downtown!
Vinny, he almost killed you!
No it wasn't!
Excuse me.
What are you doing?
Whoa, wait, this--
Relax... okay. Let me leave!
C'mon. Hey-- you're breaking the fourth wall! Sam's not gonna like this! Let me leave! Sam's not gonna like this!
Wait, what?
Hey, you're watching a pimp and Amir!
I'm a pimp!
I am!
I'm swiping right! I matched on Tinder...! She is sixteen.
Nineteen. Easy does it. Nineteen. What did I sing?
Pervert! That's illegal.
Yeah.
Okay.
Alright.
So we're clear, she's sixteen-- nineteen! Now you got me sayin' it!
Anyway, this is a snatch made in Heaven! Alright? Nineteen. Her name is Lod.
Lod. L-O-D. As in she has double-D's. It's French or some shit, and I'm going to french...  ...her tits!
I'm gonna stop you right there. I wouldn't do that, just 'cause you're what my Tinder coach would call an app-killer. You're someone who doesn't just get left-swiped; you actually inspire people to delete the app.  You're ugly.
Sometimes the truth hurts. You've got to embrace it. I was an app-killer myself before I met Chet, but it only cost me fifty bucks per match to become Mr. Right-Swiped!
Goddamn right I do.
Just the one. Just the one so far, but I've only been right-swiping for a year.
The trick? Shirtless pics! That's right, a topless pic for this thick dick makes the chicks--
...sick!
I fingered a cat, dude! At a shelter!
I guess I'm just excited about my date with Lod tonight.
With Lod.
Get this, dude: I'm gonna meet her online. She's got a cam, and I am her man! Me and a couple other choice bachelorinos are going to, uh...  ...kinda jack it, while she  talks dirty to me!  Da-na-na, da, da-na-na-na-naaa, na-na-na, na, naaa-na-na!
What the fuck did you just say?
Whoa, buddy! What the fuck did you just say about my girlfriend?
Tread lightly. Fucker.
Meaning?
Yeah! Lod keeps you guessing, man. That's why I dig her. Plus we really connected over chat! Things got real!
Yes! I kind of like when girls ask for what they want. I think that's sexy. Maybe you disagree.
Sorry for me telling her what I want too!
Fair.
I was worried about losing her.
She's there for me when I'm feeling weak.
By the way, I resent the implication that I'm not good at texting. I'm a Casanova in that regard.
There we go. Everything's right in the world.
She deserved it.
Didn't have to.
'Cause I do.
Didn't have to.
I do. I love her so much.
Didn't have to.
What don't you understand, dude? She's playing hard to wet!
What?
No...
No!
Lod!
Why, Lod?
Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir!
Don't have time for that.
You know, just--
Can you stop taking the online personality quizzes?
Don't talk to me like that. Alright? You change moods so quickly, it's obviously a problem. Right? A version of psychosis, I think.
Perfect example.
Alright, do me a favor: don't say "here". Don't say "here" like you're doing me a favor. You post literally all of them to your news feed.
Get a different face.
That's one thing you can help, by the way: if they're viral. You don't have to share them.  "I got Spiro Agnew! Which Vice President are you?"
"I got the nine of spades! Which card are you?"
"I got a matzoh ball! What ethnic food are you?"
These are all so dumb; the last one's straight-up racist.
..."What bean are you?"
I was repeating the title in disbelief-- it's "lima", by the way. You're mispronouncing the bean you think you are. What possible questions could even exist on that quiz?
Never mind. Forget I asked.
Weird.
Racist.
"Lima"!
Second! Oh, God, I'm sad for you.
You know, you haven't responded to a work email in a year. Do you mind if I bring that up?
Yup, just found the date of the last email you sent. May 2013. About a memorial service for Kunal Shah, that programmer who died? You wrote, "LOL! Not going to this. Who wants to join me for all you can wings and beer at anywhere-but-there bar."
I'm on Spotify. I could listen to almost any song and they'd all be more important. Why take these moronic quizzes? Why broadcast the results?
...Okay.
You're watching Jake and Amir.
"Nothing too drastic"? You're talking about... surgery! Invasive, elective surgery!
Meatballs on your keyboard.
Try to do things quietly.
Dude. So bad.
I'm not your secretary-- and... come on, of course. We have work every Wednesday--
Not smart. Just gonna confuse him.
Starting a DJ business.
That's what I guessed. Why have a conversation with you if you're just gonna--
Can you please not shake so much? Just contain the excitement. You enter every single conversation with an agenda, so, like, no matter what direction it goes--
Yes it does! If you're using "pro bono" correctly.
That's one thing you can help! The reviews suck if you suck! So you improve yourself!
I'm looking at them right now. "DJ Shmumu pressed 'play' on a Spotify playlist and fainted."
"DJ Shmumu fainted upon arrival!"
"He woke up and tried to load a Spotify playlist, but promptly fainted again!"
Stop saying "yeah"! You shouldn't be fainting this much.
Oh my God.
You fainted!
Sleep more. Get a better diet.
...On second thought, man, just let yourself die.
Right, which it looks like you wrote thirty seconds ago, so I guess you wrote it as you were fainting. "DJ Shmumu's pretty good, but he deserves to die. Hold on, I think I'm fainting."
Hang up.
Why does he trust you?
Why do you do this?
Here we go.
That has nothing to do with being a DJ.
How is that his fault?
He fainted, Mickey.
Mickey, he's gone.
Hey Mickey, let's hope he dies, huh? For both our sakes, Mickey.
Mickey.
Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir!
Bad idea.
That's a really good point.
So mean!
Welcome to town, man. It's good to have you here...
You didn't know we were eating today? By the way, looks like you did pack a lunch. Just a... giant bag of carrots, but still.
You don't need all of the information. Okay? Just see if you can enter a conversation seamlessly.
Jesus.
You know, I think your sound system is unimportant shit.
Worst hands ever; stop doing that-- so it's the least important part, right?
You're dominating the conversation! What hobbies do you even have?
Why would you think that's even close to a hobby? It's the opposite of a hobby. A hobby's an enriching way to spend your spare time, and that's just... that's tearing at the fabric of a loving relationship.
We were talking about something.
Yeah, of course.
Yeah. Chew better. Just chew it all the way 'til it's mush, and then swallow. You don't swallow early.
Don't bring an entire bag of carrots to lunch. You bring one or two. I mean, you sat down 'cause you wanted to have a conversation, right?
Pat... Patrick.
What do you want to gab about?
Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir!
Don't.
...spending time with friends and family--
Right, I see that. "Tiny Wings 2". "Snood 2". You don't have the rights to either of those games.
...Exactly.
Why.
Do you?
...As well as in real life, right?
That's not how it worked. You thought we went to the Moon by accident?
Call tech support. Alright? Get my phone fixed.
I can hear you peeing.
Yes.
Let me see your phone.
You're invading other people's privacy.
That's a long piss.
Then I'm gonna stop you right there. It shouldn't be on this list.
You're so scatterbrained. What do you do? You just sit around your apartment coming up with game ideas, when you have an idea for facial hair? You don't have to write down every dumb idea that comes into your mind!
I've said that. I've always said that.
Spotify is for songs. Also, that wasn't a game.
Fine. Just my first critique then. Spotify's already for songs.
You mean regular acne?
Say an idea, or I'm gonna leave.
That actually sounds pretty satisfying.
Why are you pitching me anything?
Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir.
I didn't sneeze.
No. No, please--
Tell you what--  does anybody want a computer? Does anyone want a desktop? Amir doesn't use his.
To work.
So your first vacation idea is not taking one. And working. Which you're not doing right now because you're sitting here, reading me this list.
Can you?
These aren't even vacation ideas!
Still! They're in the top ten! They're on the list, that you called "Vacation Ideas"!
What is relaxing about a boot camp? How is that a vacation?
...Isn't Devon Sawa dead?
...Fine.
That's impolite. Wouldn't you say that's in poor taste? Can't he rest in peace?
No he wouldn't! So far, three of your ideas have been about visiting celebrities who definitely don't want you there. One of whom is dead.
You know, that's almost as sad as the Brad Renfro one. How are these vacation ideas? Barely any of them have involved a destination! Most of them have involved not traveling!
You crossed lists? With another scroll?
You need to stop writing all these scrolls.
What other scroll could this possibly even be from?
Just to be clear: don't think you had a good scroll up until this point.
Absolutely not.
Not going with you.
Oh! I'm gonna throw up!
I can't believe you just snot rocketed on me. I can't believe how much came out.
You know what, dude? Fuck it. Snot rocket for you. Here we go--
Aah! Idiot!
Aah! Ass!
Oh!
Oh, no! Dude!
What happened?
Bye.
We specifically tried not to include you. The email went out to a special Listserv we created, called "allbutamir@collegehumor.com".
Can you not order in weird rhymes? It's rude.
..."Whats"?
Of course we noticed that.
It's not humor. It's just an observation.
Give me the phone.
Four two two...
You are talking to him. By the way, I paid for this food. Okay? Remember, your card number was sixty-nine.
No, it does not!
--Stop it!
Your hobbies aren't important. They don't affect anyone or anything.
Your hobbies are bad.
You're bad.
Baseball players wear cleats.
God, this is sad.
Raise your hand if you like Amir.
What?
No it doesn't.
Oh, man.
It's over, man. That was the final.
Cool.
Egotistical.
I stopped.
How's that a plan? That's a question.
What makes you think it's so easy to date a celebrity? What makes you even think you deserve to be canoodling with anybody, let alone somebody as beautiful and strong as Jamie Lee Curtis?
Don't say that word in the office.
You're a PR nightmare bullshit.
You fuck off, dude! You think any publicist out there is gonna let their client date a thirty-one-year-old guy who shits in his pants?
Recently! Recently you changed them!
Well you shit in them over a year ago! So you fuck off!
Jesus, dude...  Why didn't you tell me you had an in with Bynes?  Ha ha haaa! She's all that!
You're goddamn right, Blumenfeld! Gimme that email address! Let me email her.
For you! ...Let me email her for you. What kind of monster do you think I am? I'm just trying to help you out...
...idiot... I swear to God, I swear to God...
"Dear Ms. Bynes..."
"Today is the first day of the rest of your wife!"
Girls love that lovey-dovey shit, dude.  "I have admired you from afar--" scratch that-- "I have Aladdined you from Jafar..."
Girls love Disney. That Disney shit. Stop second-- really, stop second-guessing me. Alright? "I would love to take you out to a meal of sushi, my treat, if you will treat meat to a seat... on your face!"  "Love... Jake."
Yes. Fuck off, dude! That's the "fuck off" email!
Oh... you're crying, dude? Hey, you can still be the best man at the wedding.
...No, that's really the kind of thing I should run by my fiancee! Bynes has to weigh in on that! You understand. It's a partnership! Not a dictatorship! She might want to have one of her A-list celebrity friends give her away! Ryan Reynolds, Ryan Gosling, Ryan Phillippe, some Ryan! I promise you, it's Ryan. Fuck... fuck, man, it might be Seacrest. Ryan Seacrest at my fucking wedding? It's a star-studded-- my, my wedding's gonna look like the fuckin' Oscars.  I'm just like... holy shit!
Honestly, dude, I don't mean for this to be all passive-aggressive, but... all's bare...
...in shove...
...and floor.
Ohhh! Incoming email from amandabynes@gmail.not... a bounce-back? From Mailer-Daemon? ...That means she's with Matt Damon! Just my luck! You said she had a friend though? Meg Ryan? What's Gucci with her?
Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir.
And they do.
Semicolon, semicolon, asterisk, "hi Amir", question mark. Yeah, that's pretty bad.
So then she didn't even respond.
...Asshole.
I'm talking about you. You're an asshole.
Smooth transition. What horoscope things?
So not horoscope things, just horoscopes in general.
You think people are just talking about them lately, or always?
Oh my God.
Got it. Cool.
Don't pretend like you didn't know.
That's exactly it, by the way. Good guess.
Down to the minute.
That's vintage anybody.
Try not to learn new things.  The stars look like a lion, and it knows how I'm gonna act?
Put your hand down, 'cause you're not teaching me anything, okay? It's like you read the Wikipedia for horoscopes-- I don't even think you got into astrology...
No? I didn't-- didn't think so.
And then you just regurgitate everything like it's your new worldview! Your mind is so impressionable.
Yes it is!
God, that's fast. Even for you, that was fast. You're, like, hypnotized. Like, you'll believe anything anyone says.
You're getting sleepy.
You're getting very sleepy.
Didn't say I was your master.
Anything I say is your command. Your mind is open to my suggestion.
...Yes.
Fine. Just don't repeat it, okay?
...When I snap my fingers, you will wake up.
And when you wake up, you will...
You'll throw yourself out the window.
That's right. When I snap my fingers, you will awaken and run out the window.
Fine. Open the window...
...then jump.
No chicken. Just jumping. Leaping, out of a four-story window, to your death.
Before you go...
...remember to shoot me a text. Something like... "Hey, there was nothing you could have done to stop me", et cetera.
A suicide text of sorts. Indeed. So when I snap my fingers--
Exactly.
Got it. Okay, so I'm gonna snap my fingers. Wake up, suicide text...
Out the window. No chicken.
No clucking-- you can do whatever you want on the way down.
Just be sure to do the... you know, the important bullet points.
I don't know, man. Just... whatever. Just chilling.
Oh, yeah. Go for it.
Semicolon, dollar sign, "Jake tried to kill me", sunglasses emoji, "I'm not a chicken".
You're a Capricorn.
Heeeey!
Oh! Your breath smells awful!
I'm OK.
I'm good.
I just don't want--
I know?
I didn't say anything. Do you wish I did?
Did you think I was declining because I thought you were gonna make me pay for it?
Fair? No it wouldn't. That would mean I get half the pack of gum, and I said no to a piece.
Relax! Alright? I'll have a piece of gum.
Piece! Never correct me--Just give me the gum!
Never mind.
You're not working here at all!  I don't think I've ever seen you do or complete a single task--chew the gum with your mouth closed. Alright?  You look so unnatural doing it.
Don't bob your head--it's not friendly. What's friendly about it?
I don't want the gum. I was just gonna take it so you would shut up!
Focus!
I don't wanna sit next to you anymore.
I wanna move desks.
I'm done.
Doesn't matter that the gum's gone. I'm--
It's small, maybe, in the grand scheme of things but the grand scheme of things is what I'm worried about, OK? It's a lot of little things, like this, adding up. Also...you know, you stabbed me once--
More often than I've stabbed anyone!
That's also the first time you apologized for it which is pretty fucked.
It's my own pack of gum.
It's a pretty nice gesture. I see where you were going this whole time--
I thought this was a gift.
Please stop it.
Stop, bud.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
I said "thank you".
And I appreciate that, and I would actually like that... well, I'm trying to subdue you a little bit.
I know, and I don't want you to be.
I know.
You're not a gangster, you were never shot, you're not wealthy, talented, or successful, you're not a good businessman, you're not friends with Eminem...
I know.
I don't think I would like a two-nine fish sandwich.
I know how you make up realities to justify the weird stupid things you do...
I bet there is actual shit on that.
Yeah. Wow.  "Free hug from Amir."
"Free massage from Amir."
"Free impression from Amir. White celebrity only."
"Free impression from Amir. Any ethnicity goes. Hey, this is your birthday, after all."
Racist.
They get violent. "Free punch from Amir to anybody of your choosing. Females allowed/encouraged. No questions asked."
"Freestyle rap, fifty dollars off"? Fifty dollars off of what?
So it's not free.
I don't love the coupon book. Why don't you just take it back?
Sorry, bud! That's what you get for trying to give me a bum gift!
How are you this fragile?
Even if I just sliced you, you're bleeding way too much!
Look, Murphy. Get out of here, okay, dude? It's not that big of a deal.
You want to talk about injuring people at work? Amir's done so much worse. Hell, man, you've done a lot worse!
Tattletale!
Ouch! Dude, let go, alright? It's my friggin' birfday!
I don't want it to be my Murphday.
I hate my Murphday.
I don't like that one bit. Amir, I want to use the coupon!
That's the rapping one! The punching one!
Females allowed! Females encouraged! Aaaah!
Why?
Nice.
Washing your hands after you shit? Not stealing from sleeping homeless women? Holding yourself accountable, morally and professionally, for a--
I never said that. I never said that-- do the washing your hands one.
Backwards computer.
Come on.
First thing's first is your social security number.
I know you don't have one.
You're an illegal alien.
I already know.
What do you need points for?
For what?
To go where?
Cool.
My name's Jake.
"What's the largest purchase you've ever made?"
A koi fish?
You know what? I don't want to know anything else, about you, or the dolphins. Stop talking!
Is that a tweet?
Okay.
How many people?
No deal.
Alright, now I feel bad.
I feel bad.
Stop roasting yourself.
It's not a magic card. Yeah, you can buy whatever you want, as long as--
Right. As long as you pay the m--
You already have one. Look at this. You've had it for two years, and you owe a lot of money.
"Low"?
Your breath is so bad.
...Dolphin--
Not what I was gonna say.
Of course not.
So low.
Bad.
Really bad.
Didn't say it.
What do you mean, "lands on"?
You're a monster.
Right, so--
They're not gonna hack your nuts off--
--but you'll go into debt and they'll take away your possessions--
It's very normal. It's very normal because under "Debt" you wrote "150K dolphin fee", under "Address" you wrote "Fuck off NSA", and under "Annual Income"-- I don't even know how you did this, 'cause it's a drop-down menu-- but you wrote "Flappy the dolphin is my guarantor; give me the gold card".
What?
I didn't say anything. You said "unhealthy"--
You said "unhealthy", then I didn't say anything. If you're trying to start a conversation--
Why do you do that?
You're eating nachos!
You're eating nachos right now, and you're drinking a chocolate milkshake.
You're a fuckwad.  You think standing at your desk burns-- what, that's like fifteen hundred calories! Alright? And-- ...also, you're sitting.
...AKA what?
Waiting for you to finish! AKA means "also known as".
It's not just a pe-- it's not the end of the sentence!
A pun?
We don't have to talk! We don't have to talk at the office. That's not leading a healthy lifestyle. You can't afford to eat that food.
Your eyes are shut. So you're not doing anything while you work. You're just doing crunches, and... what terrible form! You're twirling your ass on top of the ball like you're wiping with it.
Redundant.
I think sciatica is pain in your leg.
...If you're this sick, if you're this unhealthy, why don't you just do the decent thing, and allow yourself to die?
That was real.
I know, and I mean it every time.
Trust me, I know.
I feel bad as a person that I want so badly for you to be dead and gone, but I--
No, I think I'm just gonna be open with it.
Thirty seconds ago, you were boasting about your standing desk, and now you're on the floor.
What work are you handing in? You're just shoveling nachos into your face, lying down on the ground, and-- oh my God, you're asleep.
How is that possible? You were just yelling. Now you're asleep.
Thank you...
Ass.
Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir.
Why?
No computer at all today, huh?
Why even come in?
Nice.
Don't act giddy like I'm gonna be excited about helping you choose a headshot.
My opinion is you suck.
Why do you need headshots? You have a job. You have a salary. Health insurance.
What a dumb headshot, buddy.
Any amount of money you spent on those would be a bad amount of money, considering you're not an actor and you don't need them.
God, these are nice.
Did you bring this cutlery to work just to make me do this?
It doesn't matter where the napkin is, okay? What's the role?
Are you sure you don't mean firm Steinberg and Ginsberg? And the role is just an office job that you're not qualified for?
Nice, dude. Give it to me.
Yikes. Way too revealing. Right? I mean, at least you had the decency to blur your pubes.
You grow blurry pubic hair?
Sorry, did Terry Richardson take these?
Nunya Business?
Do something else with your life.
That's crazy! Of course that's crazy. Trying to open up your own gallery when you have a job, and... you're not very good at painting!
You're so fast at being dumb. Why don't you just try to harness that power for good, instead of... stupidity?
Quick. Burned.
Bad business idea. Bad you. Just stop acting, stop painting, stop baking. It's a waste of time, money, and I think effort, though it seems like you don't try very hard at anything.
That one's pretty good.
Origami.
It's a swan.
You're watching a really cool episode of Jake and Amir.
I rule in it.
Hey, everybody. Jake here. Look, I've been seeing this little thing poppin' up around on Facebook, just... just here and there, but you know me. I like to get into trends early. So here I--
Did I invite you in here to brag, Blumenfeld? I don't like to share the limelight, so why don't you tread light. Fucker.
Shhhhhh. Just relax about why I invited you in here.  Look, been seein' this Cup of Water Challenge thing on Facebook, but... you know, I'mma do it J-Witz style, do you two better. First of all: I say fuck it, I'm gonna go a whole bucket. And, uh, another thing, Regis: I put a freakin' ice cube in here. And that is my final answer.
And IIIIII-ee-III will always ice cube!  Makes it colder, makes me bolder.
"It's c-- It's ca-- It's c--" You got a stuttering prboblem much, dude?
Yeah, I said "prboblem". I s-- I misspoke. I misspoke, but you stuttered!
Any-- how! I'm gonna freeze myself with this here bucket, like, uh, Jack Nicholson at the end of the Shining. Hey, you think he ever met Steve Urkel? From Family Matters?  "Uhh, did I do that?"
Alright. Fuck you.  Okay. I'm not gonna do this before challenging a couple of my close personal friends to, uh, take the Jake challenge, that is, not a cup, but the fuck-it bucket, and, uh, not just one, but a big-ass cube o' ice!
Okay. Bradley Cooper, from Limitless. Tarvis Baker, from Blink-182 . And, and another guy: Vanilla Bean Ice himself! Stop-- Hammer time!  Dahh-nah-nah-nah... nah-nah, can't touch this.
Hey, hey, hold on, before you do it,  as I understand it, I was challenged to donate a hundred dollars to ALS research, unless I dump this, this bucket of water on my head, in which case... ALS research, y'all owe me a hundred bucks.
Just-- ...I didn't invite you here to do an interview, did I? Let's do this! Come on!
Oh! Oh-ho-ho-ho, that was legit! Less than room temp, dude! Look! Major shrinkage.
I have a tiny dick.
I know.
Why is it expensive?
...What?
Bad joke! Bad teeth!
Why?
Why did you do that to your face? What's wrong with you?
How do you make cash?
I didn't ask what cash was. I asked how you made it. You don't do anything.
Okay, then you know what? You don't make anything. You get pathetic handouts from your old man, and it's not cool to flaunt that with exorbitantly expensive jewelry for your teeth.
On sale, and still, it's probably pretty expensive.
He's got a friend named Sale?
...Sale, or Sal?
Which one?
Sale, or Sal?
Which one is it? Sale, Sal, or Sam?
Doesn't matter. Okay, you got the grill off him?
Still breathing. So she hadn't passed.
Flap her wings?
...No! No, of course not, 'cause then all my questions would have been about that! Why did the goose have teeth?
Decent pun, doesn't explain the teeth, and your gums are bleeding.
Kind of a lot of blood, and it's a pretty big price to pay, man! You don't have teeth. You and your cousin are friends with a goose.
Still! A goose!
Please, just one insane thing at a time. Why did the goose have teeth?
Which you stole.
Where are your real teeth?
Why do you hate yourself?
Oh, I know that did hurt.
There it is.  Finally. That's what I was hoping for. That's the way you should always be.
Don't use that word like that.
Quick to get those.
It's the stupidest thing I've ever heard. Nothing revolves around you. You absolutely don't matter, 'cause you're a goose murderer. You're a teeth thief.
Raw meat. In your mouth.
Holy shit, how is it sizzling?
Out of time.
Looks like you already went on an offline stealing spree. You clearly stole this from the Apple store.
Alright. Brad.
I am calling you Brad. If you're ordering clothes just 'cause it rhymes, that's a bad idea.
Airplanes were a good idea. And business isn't booming.
You're never right. You're never right about--
You already have sunglasses.
I think you do. Remember, you're really fast at putting them on?
God, that was quick. It was so fast.
"Oh" is right, man. Your shopping cart is getting really expensive. You're not even comparing prices across other sites. I don't even think you're looking at the sizing chart with a discerning eye.  That's a medium, a medium, a small, an extra small, an extra large, a size eleven shoe, a size two shoe!
...Was that a fart, or--
I got it.
So don't buy them.
A gala? I've never seen anyone invite you to lunch!
Ow--
Who are you talking to?
I can't believe you scratched me.
Like a cat.
I don't care.
So what?
You're not going to a gala!
Hey-- no!
That's not a lifehack. That's the most boring idea in the world. You'll just have a package with the name Vance on it.
A gala. Yeah, I know.
Tell you what, buddy. Why don't you just leave them in your online basket, you don't have to check out right now--
--but if you get invited to a white tie event--
--or a gala... I'm not saying-- look--
You can order them in time!
Smart. Smart, good.
Yeah? We're not.
Pee-proof?
What is pee-proof? You said that first.
Hey-- hey! Don't! Leave it! Oh!
Great. You shut your eyes, and you didn't click "Order". You just deleted your whole cart.
You pissed on my shirt a little bit, by the way.
Oh-- hey!
Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir.
Perfect.
Can you please just go back to your desk? I'm trying to work--
Oh!
Oh, God!
Shards?
I'll get help.
...What?
Dude, you are clearly in a lot of pain right now.
You're not gonna have an ass when this is all done! You just sliced it, buddy! You sliced it wide open!
Oh!
Then get off it!
Hey!
Amir, your ass is burned.
It's cut!
So climb up on out of that copier, huh? Pal? Can't be worth it.
Is what funny?
Nothing's funny about this! It's self-mutilation, bud! And there are no copies.
You pressed "fax"! You're faxing a picture of your burned, bleeding asshole to my accountant.
It's a her, and no.
Don't be misogynistic. You're getting fucked by a copier.
The drawer is empty.
You should have looked before you--
No! I will not! I will not do that. I'm not gonna help you.
I'll do it. God, just stop.
Nobody even knows you did that. And you have to wear a diaper now.
Oh God, you need new stitches.
Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir.
From what?
Oh-- no. Paul's cousin texted me something funny.
Paranoid.
Delusions of grandeur.
Bad clap.
It's 12:14, you just got here thirty seconds ago, and you're already ready to interrupt the day.
Yo have the worst hands I've ever seen on a man.
Keep them under the desk.
Don't take a stance anymore. On anything.
Steve Jobs is dead.
Ass.
"Spee"?
"Spee and sy"?
"Spee and spy".
Still, you're using the word "spee", so what are you mixing it with?
"See and spy".
...What?
Shut up! What's funny? Why do you believe this, and why would you be amused?
Was it a selfie?
It's a joke. Come on.
Your dick's actually out!
There are just two cameras. Alright? Stop adding your own cameras. By the way, you have an iPhone. You're holding it right now.
Is your social security card taped to the back of it?
You're a dipshit. I never even said I wanted the new iPhone.
There aren't.
You think Steve Spielberg wants to fuck you through the front-facing camera of your iPhone?
You're paranoid-- you did say it. You're delusional.
I know you're serious. You're also horny or something, 'cause you keep on talking about masturbating.
You are ugly.
Is that an iPhone?
