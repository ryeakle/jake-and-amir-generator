That works. Hey, is there a deli that would deliver twelve dozen hard boiled eggs to me right now?
Ah, forget it.
No, look, if you don't have it off the top of your head its not worth it to me. Just make the bet.
Don't be sorry, just get me the eggs

Are you the egg man?
I'll tell you what Rick Fox is not doing here. He's not enjoying 144 delicious hard boiled eggs.

Why you are not holding 144 delicious hard boiled eggs right now is beyond me!
Do you know how I won three NBA championships with Los Angeles Lakers?
What? Eggs? What are you talking about? Hard work, defense, rebounding. Eggs?
Why are you talking about eggs?
Are you obsessed with eggs?

One rooster, one chick.  smooch I'm bored...I'm bored!
I was not talking to you!
Don't worry about it. Did you get into the Egg Box yet?
What'd I say?
I was trying to break the lock.
Look, in that box right there is where Jake keeps eggs.
Otherwise, why would it be locked?
Handsome.
Hey look, look, look, look, look. When's Jake gettin' back from lunch?
Yeah, when's he gettin' back from lunch? EGG SALAD. What?
Look that kool katt tried to hot dog with a low V.
Look.  You got two options.
One, pay me all the money you owe me. Or two , break in there and get me all the eggs in the world.
Yeah, instant loss.
The only thing tempered right now is you!
Do you want to join Jake for lunch?
Look, I don't wanna be the bad guy. Ok, that's just the way it is. I married a chicken.
