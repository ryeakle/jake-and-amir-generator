Yep!  Chicken fried nuggets!
Medium rare.
And a martini.
I just took your order less than thirty seconds ago, so it's gonna be about fifteen minutes.
Oh, actually I can't, I'm not allowed to-
I'm not allowed to, nor would I want to.
Excuse me.
Oh, happy birthday!
Uh, usually for parties.
Okay, I guess we could. Just give me a second.
Yeah, don't call me that!
Ready? Okay!
I'm good.
Can I get you something?
Yup. One martini comin' up!
Oh. No.
Let go of my arm... and I'll go get her.
It's Jessica. I'll just go grab--
I'm sorry.
I didn't even specify a suit. Shouldn't be that hard. I see two Jacks right there.
