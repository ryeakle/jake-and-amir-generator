Hello.
I'm sorry, I missed the train. I must look terrible.
Goodbye!
I'm mad at you because you saw me speaking Hebrew at a bar and hit on me, demanding that I come meet you here at this park, that you'd have a translator. I told you I spoke English well, and you laughed, saying that it was a cute attempt at speaking normal.
I figured I'd come here for a free meal, but you are so unbearable to be around, that it's not worth it! Though I am happy that you're not wearing that ugly fedora anymore. And those dog tags.
Is that a watch?
Ugh.
And we already have pizza.
Make him stop!
I think soccer players are the hottest.
