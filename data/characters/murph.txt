Uh, hey, man... Um, back from the bathroom, so...
Uh, yeah, mItIt has been five minutes; it's been, like, fifteen minutes actually. Uh, I should probably get back to work.
Hey, what's up best work station ever?
Yeah that's, that's a little racist.
Ah, yeah. Something definitely smells like shit.
Yes. Well mine's just chocolate pudding and soy milk, cause
You sent that tweet to me before you tweeted it, you wanted me to tell you if it was funny or not...
Do you guys remember how small our dicks were in high school?
God, it was like..
Seriously.
Jesus, man!
Haha, nice!
Uhm, Jake these pictures are all of you.
He said uhm, Pat just lost control of the longboard and then the Camry came out of nowhere...
What?
It's Pat's brother.
Yeah. It's a cell phone.  Every cell phone has caller ID.
Hello?
Okay guys, Pat's gonna be all right. 
It's just sad because... I mean I'd go to my grandma's house and I'm the only one taking care of her and she doesn't even know who I am anymore. I'm just in a really... just a really dark place. 
Where is it even coming from?
Get him away from me!
We are having a f*cking conversation!
Why don't we just come back later?
That's not George Foreman style.
No, like he's actually dead.
Nurple purple! Yeah! 
Aww, man!
jumping on Jake's back) Pay the bitch
(chanting) Pay the bitch, pay the bitch
(chanting) pay the bitch
(chanting) pay the bitch
Ha!
[whispering] He's a bitch.
Get out, bitch!
He's a bitch!
Let's drop him on 3!  On 3!  1, 2
Eh! Cool it! That's my girlfriend, buddy.
Fuck you!
What's going on here, guys?
You didn't, uh... You didn't catch Amir there, huh?
..Are you a bitch, Jake?
If you're a bitch, I think you should tell EVERYBODY that you're a bitch.
Say it... like I didn't TELL you to say it.
When you say come on, it sounds like you're saying it for me. Don't say it for me! I don't want to hear it! EVERYONE wants to hear that you're a bitch, Jake!
Say it.
Now you buy me and Amir that bronze elephant trunk wall sconce, and we call it Even Steve Seagal.
THEY'RE TASTEFUL AS FUCK, BRO. You got a problem?
Fall back. Trust me.
Cross your arms and fall backwards. Trust me.
Oh, god...
You wash your belts?
Put it on inside out.
Next notch.
NEXT. NOTCH.
Suck in.
Now fall.
I will ALWAYS catch you, Jake.
(laughs and whispers to Emily) It rhymed
Awesome babe, that was so hot
(angrily at Jake) WOAH! 
(irate) TASTE MY TONGUE!?!
(interrupting) Are you REALLY talking to my girl like that!?!? Are you REALLY!?!?!
YOU ARE! YOU ARE! OK!
(to Amir) Oh yeah, what's going on here!?
Your ass is mine McMexican! Your ass is MIIIIINNNNNNEEEEEEEUUUUUUAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!!!
I don't know what happened back there. I just... I lost it. I love you so much.
And I just feel like I need to work on my anger problems...
(in a deep, agitated voice) Absolutely. 
Hurwitz, quit looking at my girl's pussy and come spot me!
What did you bring?
Och is that a red?
Dude I told you we're serving branzino, that's not gonna pair well.
Oh my god you're serious. Amir! Start chilling some greige!
Lemme score a sniff? (Sniffs each bottle) Let's go with the Ritratti. Jake what do you think?
Yes, her name's Neko and she's got swag for days bro.
Relax, alright? I can shit shower and shave in thirty seconds flat. I'll be back here in a tucked in express button up before 
Get the door, dumbass.
Time! Time! What's my time?
I shit in the shower and I tried to smoosh it down the drain. Got everywhere.
As ready as I'll ever be.
Tonight!
During you're here!
I mean I want it to be intimate, so I figure, what's more intimate than a double date?
Hah. How about this, if you try to leave, I'll kick you in the back!
Yo, you ever taken a picture of your dick next to a slider and told the girl it was a full on burger?
(Handing Jake his phone) Check it.
Hah, it's like a... pff... wrong picture so it's like that's a triple quarter pounder or er... I'm gonna kick you in the back!
You're watching Jake and Amir.
Nice.
It's okay, but-- hey, Jake, uh, if your date had dietary restrictions, you really should have emailed us ahead of time. That would've been polite.
Well, you just threw him a curveball that he can't hit, and I kind of need tonight to go perfectlyyyyyyyyyy...
Hey, c'mon, c'mon. Easy on the grig', easy on the grig'.
I know. It's Jake's fault. It's Jake's fault. He raw-dogged us, he did-- you're blinking a lot--
That's exactly what he did. He just took us and he just fuckin' took his dry-ass little dick and he just shoved it in our raw buttholes.
[simultaneously] Alright. Right; spit-- just spit on it. That's all I'm asking. Just spit-- just one. Right. That's fine.
It was his fault!
But you're ready for this, okay? You can handle it.
Go!
[returning to the table with Amir] Whoa ho ho! Nobody touch their dinner until I post this to Pinterest. This is the most pinteresting thing I've seen all week. [he leans over Jake's shoulder] Jake, you're gonna re-pin that, right?
Good, so you'll do that?
I'd feel much more comfortable if you'd just do it now.
[whispering] Jake, don't fuckin' embarrass me at my house, dude.
Here.
Don't talk to me.
She's right... Fuck it, let's browse!
Ya gots to! Yo, that kale smoothie looks dope.
Hey hey, focus up, I need your feedback on this pin: pink aztec dress, or cupcake kebabs? I can't pin 'em both.
You don't get a say! You don't get a say.
Oh, ho ho! I didn't realize we were poppin' shirts; I was gonna wait until after the gelato, but... you only YOLO once!
Ha ha ha! Nice! Pour it out!
It was perfect!
Call me Sonny Bono-- not because I died in a horrific ski accident-- but because... [singing] I got you, babe!
Yeah! Hashtag open mouth, hashtag amazing, hashtag she was lookin' at Jake the whole time...
It's your turn, Jake. Spin the bottle.
Spin the bottle, Jake.
I don't like it any more than you do, Jake, but we need to kiss passionately.
[whispering] Because those are the rules. And they were pretty convenient when you were tonguing my soulmate, AKA my future wife!
Kiss me, Jake.
I'm frenching you 'cuz you frenched her!
Do you want it to stop?
Babe, I'm gonna go talk to Jake on the balcony.
Bye.
...Yeah, man.
It's-- It's been crazy...
It's nuts.
Yes they are!
It's-- It's been crazy...
It's nuts.
I browned out!
I browned out, man!
I was following my heart!
I'm so-- I d--
Okay--
Okay, that was wack of me.
Okay, it was-- it was--
It was eight stories. Eight stories.
[also crying] I didn't mean to!
[crying] You kissed-- you kissed my girlfriend...
[crying] It was the grig', man, it was the grig'..
[crying] It was a friggin' Ritratti, yeah, it was a Ritratti...
Jake, you gotta propose to Neko.
I need you out of the game, man. You need to Jake one for the team.
Look, man, it's my way or the balcon-ay!
Are you okay... with this?
Emily Wayne Dolphin... I want to-- luh-luh-luh-lick you-- for the rest of my life.
April Fools!
'Sup, Jake. ...Making Amir feel bad again?
[leaning over, whispering to Jake] I think that you owe Amir an apology.
[leaning over] I don't think Amir could hear you.
Because you were yelling like a bitch.
So let's try that again, Jake. [Jake whimpers again] This time, without the bitchly screaming.
Amir, do you accept that?
Amir, should we give Jake one more chance to apologize like a man... [leaning down to Jake] and not scream like a bitch?
[to Jake] Everyone deserves a second... [ripping off another bandage] chance!
[smiling calmly] I'm applying warming jelly to your back. Jake, the soup wasn't burning hot... it was freezing cold. [Amir nods] You went into shock, and... we told you your body was covered in third-degree burns. [staring off into the distance, still massaging Jake] It's funny, you know? You're always wondering what to expect... maybe you should start expecting what to wonder.
Oh shit, I'm sorry.
What'd you say about me?
[laughing] That's good writing.
Very good writing.
[yelling] Sex scene! Jake!
It's a little too hot, don't you think, Jake?
[yelling] Off-screen chemistry!
[yelling] That's it!
