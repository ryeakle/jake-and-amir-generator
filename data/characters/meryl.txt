I just found out I'm six months pregnant.
That's too late to terminate. My parents hate my boyfriend and they think I'm still a virgin. They're gonna disown me. I dunno what to do.
I know.
Randy doesn't know yet.
I'm an intern. I was in here trying to cut out of work early to go to this fucking rave but this jackass has been grilling me so hard that I have to come clean. He has a keen sense of right and wrong and a true gravitas about him. In fact... permission to sit on your face?
