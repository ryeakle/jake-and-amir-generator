Evidently, I know next to nothing about poker so I may have missed out on some lingo. I also am not completely familiar with all the guys' voices so some names may not be right when someone's talking off-screen. There were a ton of inaudible things I just couldn't put together so if y'all could help, that would be awesome comploodle. Be as nitpicky as possible. :P Oh, and a huge congratulations to the cumulative and collaborative effort of this subreddit to have now officially transcribed every single Jake and Amir video ever. Oh sheesh y'all.

We won't know for a couple of weeks, but they flat out told me, in the room: Nooo!
To tell Amir that I made it.
Cats!
I'll shred the entire thing and as a favor to you, I will never bring it up again.

Is he dead yet, or is it not that kind of intervention

amir: What are you doing here, Doobs?
I RSVP'd to this intervention one year ago today, on E-vite
You can't call me that any more, A-Weird.
Yes! Because of three seconds ago I have litterally changed my name yet again to Penis Dickling, The Goose!
Grrr, Curse you!
Never matter, we're not here to discuss myself, or the millions of films I've now been cast in. We're here to talk about A-Weird and his father, and his father's tiny, spindly, sticky little legs.
Oh you haven't heard? I am now officially, and universally, a famous actress
I didn't. I've been casted as the fem fatal in the brilliant film A bridge over river Queer. Yes, you heard that. How do you like that range, even Thomas Hanks hasn't played a woman, and he's a MTV award nominee!
No, I'm not. Tell me, do you have a CD-ROM drive?
What?
Meaning?
Then what the hell is this?
Okay, and these?
Well then wheres you're CD-ROM drive?
How many gigabytes does you're company own?
You're not a tycoon, you're whole job is a lie!
Give me your CD-ROM drive!
What is that?
Meaning?
Level with me, this has an MPEG 4 on it, can you play it?
It's brilliant Brava, Brava, Brava!
You call one person, then that person calls another person and then that person calls another person.  Doesn't mean, like, everybody's calling you, making it so you can't respond to your texts, right?  It's some kind of reverse phone tree?  Were you the trunk?  If you're the trunk, then you got punked.
drum roll please.
Come on!
Sure.
Great!
Yup. One martini comin' up!
Oh. No.
Let go of my arm... and I'll go get her.
It's Jessica. I'll just go grab--
And Penis.
Penis Scarlett Johansson Anal. Good luck making fun of that, A-squirdge.
Yes!
Well now I'm filthy, stinkin' rich when this things gets released to the public. And I hope it bites you on your filthy, little ass. Just like your father did to me with his tiny, spindly, little legs.
Yes, you. The bell hop.
Nightmare-ishly thin. 3 centimeters in diameter. No bones, just blood and skin. He wrapped them around my waist like a limp garden hose and no matter how hard I struggled to get free, he'd put them tighter and tighter like a boa constrictor. Or worse still, a garden snake! You know, I still have dreams about them.
No, A-smears, dreams.
I'd love one.
Alley-oop
Sold out!
And the shaft!
And the sack!
And the pussies.

what were your motives? Why did you choose to do this as a movie?
Yes, well when I first conceived of the plot and the story I was in a cave in Siberia.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mmmm, I've got ideas for a squeak-quel.
Well this time around I don't want any studio muckin' it up with all its bullshit, grass-roots, guerilla-style film making...
Will you be quiet? I'm trying to listen to the Q and A. But I already got what I came here for.  Amir you say? Hmmm. Very interesting.
...an ice cream social!
I have a question.
Yeah, brother.  It's for the lady.  Julie, will you marry me?  Knowing full well that you will be used in the ongoing chess match that is the life between Amir and myself.  You the pawn and me the queen.
I'm gonna hit it. And everytime I hit it, I'm gonna think of Amir.
'OH SHEESH Y'ALL TIS A DREAM'. Will smears it in Amir's face.
I'm sorry.
I didn't even specify a suit. Shouldn't be that hard. I see two Jacks right there.

I put a freakin' ice cube in here. And that is my final answer.
A woman boards a bus with her newborn baby, and the bus driver says, "Hey, ma'am, that's the ugliest baby I've ever seen." The woman, appalled-- frankly, she has the right to be-- sits down next to me and says, "That bus driver just insulted me." I said, "Lady, you don't have to take that from him. You go up there and tell him off. Here, I'll hold your monkey."
