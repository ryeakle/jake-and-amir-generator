Jake.
Grab a seat. Take a load off.
How have you been?
Oh, we've been good, we've been good.
So, Q2 reviews have been handed in. Um, peer reviews also have come in.
Listen, we're not exactly concerned about your work, um, there are, however, some red flags that we've seen.
Do you, do you two, uh, because actually this is something that we did want to talk-
Yeah. You got two seconds.
Hey.

OK, I did everything you asked me to do, alright, I found out all the information.

Jeez christ, oh mayan, oh g-
Hey - if you refer me to one of your friends just to remind you don't bring up that I choked you.
By the way, when I was feeling around on your balls, right?  You may have testicular cancer.
Cause you have more balls than you need man.
Fuck.
No, stop, ssh, we can't talk about anything else, the place might be bugged, OK?.
You wouldn't know.
Time doesn't matter but let me tell you this: you could not be trusted in that other room.
Because that way you know my hand isn't down your pants, if your hand is-
Could you tip your head back real quick?
Y2K- you remember that a couple months back? Listen, I printed out all of Drake's likes, you study those  he's gonna be best friends with you.
You ready to get a new best friend?
Say it with me:

Listen, I've printed out all of Drake's likes. You study those, he's going to be best friends with you.
Sleeeep. Sleep like a baaaaby.
I'm going to need a lot more chloroform, like 40 bottles. You know what Howard? I think I've had enough of your bullshit.
Did that work? No, okay then just like a bunch more bottles-
Okay, couple more bottles.
Hmm? What are you talking about?

Is there some law that says you can't hang out in an office with no clothes on?
Hi.
Welcome, to my office.
No, come on.
I was just stretching these parts of my arms.
I don't know what they're called, but I was stretching them.
I don't remember what I said, who knows what I said, Jake brought me here.
You sure did. I was holding like 30 bags of Funyuns and I couldn't get into my pockets again. So you took out your security card.  No, right? I brought me here.
That was a wink.
Yeah, because Jake brought me here.
Listen, I'm the head of H.R., right?  And the reason I am here is to deal with your terrible, terrible smell.
I don't think so.
My name? Is that what you want to know?  Because I'm a totally different person that you've ever seen. My name is...Fm-mm...
I never hesitate, I'm amazing at thinking of new names.
I'm amazing, unique names.
My name is Qu-Qu-Crowlidit-Cowlideen? San.
Mmmm...
I got one, I got one in my back pocket. I just memorized it.
My name?
Se-Shannon-Shoonith?
Not gonna have to.
Don't think of a just in case, I'll just use what I got.
My name? Ask me what my name is.
Ask me my name?
My name is... Shhhsscaal-
Nope. I know what my name is. My name is Scalby...Scalby-Lawfsoos.
is my fist name, my last name is... Jim.
Yeah, absolutely. Amir, you stink. Ugh, you stink.
At just smelling bad.
Yuck, I messed that up. I messed that up. There's only one thing to do.  Jake, I'm going rogue.
I don't even know what that means, what does it mean to go rogue?
Hey, don't worry. This Joe won't be Rogen.
Seth won't be Rogen.
It's too late, I'm roguein' right now.
I said a lot of things, I ate all those Funyuns, I didn't throw them out. You ready? Take off your clothes.
I can't do that, this is way smarter.
No, don't go, this is the best part!

amir:
Huh!

THE END

amir:
We have to calm down if we wanna survive!
Oh, no. There's no more water.
There's nothing in this. I didn't know what to do so I pretended there was water. We should drink each others' piss.
Ok.
Shut up with your water it's time to drink piss!
You're right, here, go, go, go, go!
You're right. We're running out of oxygen.
We have to find oxygen.
Under the door. Under the door!
We should think of a way to pass the time.
We should have a talent show.
We thought of it.
We handled that already.
You have zero talents.
You sound like a witch!
Sto-
Do your Batman.
Ohhh... Batman is in this room!
No!
How could he be there if he's right over here?
Oh my God, Amir. There's a key in the other side of this door!
Batman does?
That is Yoda doing a terrible Borat.
That's another case solved, Batman.
You've got to shut the f*ck up.
Hey. My name is Ben Schwartz and together we can make a difference. Jake and Ameesh.
Captain Internet here, and you're watching Jake and Amish!
Yeah, well it's either smell or touch. Did you see which way he went?
Who is Anette, by the way?
Yeah, and I'm asking you who's Anette, 'cause I would love to meet her. I don't have a girlfriend right now.
Yeah.
You know what, I'll do you one better. Why don't we strip down to our balls and dicks, rub against each other for warmth 'cause it's freezing out here?
90 degrees cold, we should get in a hot-cold bath.
Yeah, I'm focused up. I'm normal, I'm normally focused.
Can you believe this? The irony of the whole thing? Me, working with a cow.  This is truly my greatest nightmare.
Yeah, you got it. I bet he is.
Knock-knock, knock-knock. You here this one, knock-knock.
Interrupting you.
Moo! Moo, you idiot.  You idiot, you fell right into my trap.
It won't work, your cell phone's not gonna work on the mountain.
Oh, really? How bout now?
Now you got three bars.
Hey, are you getting tired?
'Cause I could tickle you to keep you awake. It goes like  Heeey!
Well, maybe how 'bout that dick of yours?
Right, yeah, yeah. But you looked like you were yawning for a tiny bit.
Right, but I should do it to test the waters.
Like, test the waters.
Hey, Amir.
Hey, I found him! So now what's up, boss?
Ooh.
Do you want us to strip down to our  dicks and balls and cuddle together for warmth because it's freezing?!
Was that a cow?
You're listening to Jake and Ameesh!
Hey diddly-dee, a sailors life for--  How are you? How is everything? This is what's happening: I'm goin' around this office, asking people-- because you know what happened? Some party pooper took a dump inside the copier, and I'm tryin' to find out who it was...
Inside-- they lifted up the glass, took a quick feces  inside, and closed the glass again!
It's crazy, isn't it?
Um, am I an interrogator is what he asks, and my answer is - gimme one second, I gotta double-check the facts, ummmm...
...Interrogator, yeaaah! That's what I am.
Nonono, we'll keep this right here. I'm an interrogator but I'm a guy you've never seen before. Never seen me in a million years!
I can prove you wrong, 'cuz I have a perfectly normal name.
...Carrot.
Thank youuuu, thank youuuu.
Slat.
Carrot Slat.
Why is that not normal?
I'm from Virginia.
Sorry, I was thinking of that, um... Don't Worry, Be Happy song. What'd you say?  Now I'm gonna ask you something; just answer honestly.
Quick one-two punch: Um, what's your favorite color?
Great! Thanks so much. And did you do it?
Did you take a shit in the copier?
Amir, Amir: do you dress yourself in the morning?
Ahahaha! Okay then, who does, or how do you dress yourself?
And do you have frequent bowel movements?
Do you have frequent bowel movements?
Do you take a lot of shits?
Okay, cool. So, how often in a day will you take a shit?
Forty shits?
Crazy!
I take, like, twenty!
Seems pretty good to me.
You're shitting way too much.
That's way too much.
That's it.  That's it! No more cool laid-back dude! It's all fuckin' over now! Now you get the shit! Okay? Now you get the fuckin' shit!
Oh my God...
Some party pooper took a dump inside the copier, and I'm tryin' to find out who it was...  No more cool laid-back dude! It's all fuckin' over now!
It's-a me, Ben!
You think this is fuckin' funny?
Shut the fuck up, okay? Did you...  take a shit in the copier?
...Which one?
Ya know...?
Ya know it's no!
Jake... did you take a shit in the copier?
I'm gonna ask you one more time, and this time, I'm not gonna be so nice.
Jake... did you take a shit in the copier?
Hold his arms.
Gggg-gggg-gggg...
You gonna tell me what I need to know?
I've got a family waiting for me at home; I don't need to be doing this bullshit.
It's not my family. It's a family I kidnapped.
What do you mean, Oh my God?
They're normal names. I didn't name 'em. Paul, Janet, Stanson...
I named the last one.  Where were you yesterday at noon, Amir-- and if you bullshit me, man--
This copier?
That doesn't mean anything, you know--
Stop. Keep going, Amir.
Wha-- where, which ho-- which place?
Hold his arms, Amir.
Flick-flick-flick, flick, flick, flick, flick...
Well, that's funny... 'cuz that's impossible.
...'Cuz I shit in the copier.
Thank you. Hey.
It was me the whole time!
Alright, alright, alright, alright now ladies!
Say ladies!
Shake it! Shake - shake - shake it! Shake - shake - shake it like a -

Breathe. Breathe Amir. Hash-hash-hooms.
Alright, we're gonna deliver this baby. We're gonna deliver this baby.
Push! Push! Amir, you're shitting yourself.
Bullshit!
Amir, I got some good news and I got some bad news.
The good news is you're going to die.
The bad news is I don't know what the term good news means.
I'm sorry, ok?
There's only one way to do this.
No more milk, we got it guys, so don't be silly stupid or dumb! No more milk
Ok? So shall we just pop it in he...
I thought you were doing it to the crowd, to me? To me, the crowd...
Ok guys, if I give you the milk you gotta swear to me not to...
Ok fine. I know how to do this, induce vomiting, I can do this. But I need your permission, ok?
I'm gonna warn you, it's not by the bewks.
Not by the bewks.
Not by the bewww-ks.
Shut up idiot! OK? I'm gonna take this straw, I need to stick it inside your stomach and I need to suck out the badness, and spit it out to the right. Can I do that?
WE ARE CHAMPIONS!
Do it!
I saved the day again.
You're welcome.
Charles ken..chew om noms...
I'm a guy you've never met before with a new job. We-ho!
I started a fire we all have to go!
We present to you:
Starring:
OK, Of course, of course.
Well done.
Ooh, good question, he asked: "What the fuck did I just watch".
Oh no.
Blue.
Let's go Samuel!
I have a question if you don't mind.  You guys mind? Don't care what you say. My question is: what were your motives? Why did you choose to do this as a movie?
S'cuse me
S'cuse me I'm getting my seat.
I'm getting my seat-
I'm getting my seat.  Maam, what's your name?
Franklin, let me ask you this-
Do you wanna get with a hero, a zero, or a gero.
Um...
This one is made of lamb  but the B is silent.
Aah! The beginning one was, Jake! Blamb?  Maybe you've heard of it?
Just kidding,  it's a joke, it's a joke...
...it's a joke, it's a joke.
Good! Good, good, good, good, good, good. UN-believable.
Do you mind if I ask you another follow up question?
Fantastic, do you have any ideas for maybe, I don't know- a sequel?
Tell me.
Excuse me!
Did your head hurt?
Did your head hurt when you rose from hell and you hit your head on the ceiling, you- devil angel.
I don't know
Are you trying to pick me up? It seems like you are! If it's not me then who? Who do you love?
I am a priest! Congratulations, you have been wedding-ed
I now pronounce you: man and wife
Hey, you're watching Adele Dazeem and Amir, on CollegeHabbaps.
Oh, my name?
It's funny you ask, 'cause I have a very ordinary name, and you've never met me before, so I can understand why you'd ask, so do you want to hear it?
My name-- here it comes --my name is Cherry Dude! ...Cherry... Dude!
...it better!
I think you'll find that the door is locked.
Aaah. It's the door that I need to open!
Well! I will be back with a key, and a donut! Okay?
Here I come to save the day!  Look what I brought.
I forgot the key!
I ruined a donut!  I'll be back-- with a donut!
With a key.
I'll be back with a key.
Right.
And--
Oh, just a key this time!
It confuses us.
This time I remembered...  the key!
That's a donut.
If you want to view paradise...
Now I know you haven't eaten in the past twenty-four hours, but feast your eyes on this!
Then feast your mouth on this!
Moving on!
Now let me give you a little info on the place.  We're currently inside a five-bedroom, six-bathroom colonial townhouse, in Williamsburg, Virginia.
Okay, that's my fault. It's the wrong listing.  Aaah! Here we are inside a blueberry muffin.
Is that wrong too?
Okay, let's back 'er up. Aaah!
We're currently inside a shithole in Crack City, USA.
Moving on!
Do you guys like bathrooms?
Ohhhh, damn it.
This place has zero bathrooms.
What I do is I take a shot of moisturizer, and I get real wide, get over a toilet and go like this:  Hakuna matata. Haaaaaakuna matata! Nothing happens. That's just to scare it, to get ready. Cut to seventeen hours later: I'm in my bed, shittin' my balls off. Moving on!
I shouldn't tell you this--
Okay, fine! Do you want to know who lived here before you guys?
Have you heard of a little band called the Rolling Stones?
Well, the serial killer who lived here loves the Rolling Stones. Played it while he killed people!
Lives here. Moving on!
Oh, I forgot to ask you! Oh, no! Do you guys have any pets?
Ohh-ho-ho! Good, 'cause this place already has way too many pets.
They're at work.
Yeah. Uh, you never seen a rat be a chef before?
Yes! But a dog animated it.
Just like the movie "Willy Wonka", the walls taste like things.
This one tastes like asbestos!
The snozzberries taste like snozzberries.
Ten--
--thousand--
-dollars--
--a week.
Well, I do have two other listings.
I do have one other listing, but it is absolutely terrible.
But there wouldn't be a Part Two if we didn't see it!
I do have one other listing, but it is absolutely terrible.
Welcome to Part Two of Juke and Aboot!
I can't believe we're even in this place. Look at it. It's a dump.  It comes with all the furniture... ugh, and do you smell that? You might want to clog your nose. It smells like fruit.
Well, if you love the smell of this, I got a muffin on Fairfax that'll drive ya wild!
Can we leave, please?
Another one of the countless things wrong with this place: the TV doesn't even work.  It's all in black and white, and it only plays soccer.
Whatever you call it in England, Your Majesty!
Ahhhhhh...
Wipeout! ...Please say we're done.
Here's another guest bedroom, but what's the point of having a bed in a room?
And you're a bad boy!
Hmm.  I mean honestly, I can't even count--
No. I don't know how to count.
I don't know how to count. But, let's all get up! Three, two, heel!
And here, we have your own personal movie theater, but what's the point of jerking off in a movie theater if strangers aren't like "Hey! Hey, this is Frozen! Stop doing that! Cool dick, dude!"
Moving on.
S-- you know what, I think you probably just took a shit on the masseuse.
Yeah. Did he talk?
Different language?
Was his name Sven?
I can't believe he just let you shit on him... here we go.
So, we have seen apartments today; do we know which way we are leaning?
Yeah. I think so.
No need to say it!
We know which one to get!
But just in case, should we say it?
Don't need to.
'Cause we got it.
