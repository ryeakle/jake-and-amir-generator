Speaking of fun trips, "The 9" team visited the offices of CollegeHumor, and were instantly charmed by the lovable and polite staff.
Well, in the spirit of forgiveness, I present the award for CollegeHumor Gentleman of the Year, to Jake,  the guy who stood beside me while some jackass ye--

So good!
Julia Roberts? Such a fox. Such a fox!
Shut up! Okay?! I mean, we've been trying to ignore you but that's clearly not working. The fact is: Nobody here likes you. We hate you! You groped Amanda. You ripped my shirt. I don't know why or how you still have a job, but please just be quiet and leave us alone. Please.
Hey Jake, it's Amir. Are we recording the intro thing yet?

Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir, and I can dunk a basketball.
Well, they don't have to.

Subways do NOT have in-flight HD TV, bro.
That's the Lustanza difference.
Subway. Okay, I'm not paying for your cab; I'm already $2250 down in the hole. And that's cash I DON'T have.
Can you hold on a second?
What do you want, Mom?...Okay, I don't wanna SAY goodbye to Aunt Harold! She has a mustache!  Get OFF of me!! YOU'RE HURTING MEEEEE!!

Hi.
Hi.
Yeah, but it's Leron-uh. Like you're confused.
Hi!
I missed you.
Sup!
Why would you yell at Amir?
Nothing, I just came to surprise Amir. Take him out to lunch.
I love McDonald's. Don't you?
Oh my god, is that an Aragorn action figure?
No, I love Lord of the Rings!
What's your favorite one?
Ugh, I know what you're gonna ask me.
And, I mean, I know Amir's not the smartest guy, but he's really genuine. That's what I like about him, he's just not about
Oh. Can I ask you a question?
Will you promise not to tell Amir I said he wasn't the smartest guy?
Thanks.
Jake and I were just talking about Lord of the Rings.
I was talking about the movies.
No...
He meant madam.
Do you call him out like that all the time?
Sorry, forgot my sunglasses.
Don't be embarrassed. That was cute.
It's Sunday.
You make me happy.
Hey... where are you the most ticklish?
Maybe here...?
Sorry.
Ugh, your phone has been ringing all morning, go answer it.
Hello?
He's at my place.
Oh, um, it was fun, Amir and I went to the park and we flew kites.
Sorry, Amir was tickling me. What did you say?
He wants you.
I'm sorry, I have something that I really need to ask you, and-   You can say no, but, I just- Amir and I got in a fight, and-
You're his best friend.
And I wanna make it up to him, what should I do?
Never mind, this is stupid.  Amir would be pissed I came here anyways, I should go.
It's what our whole fight was about.  I said that you were cute, or something.  It was really stupid.
Really?
Yeah.
Why wine?
Oh, sheesh y'all.
Sorry.
Maybe...I should just suck his dick.
All this effort?  Wouldn't it just be easier for me to just throw myself on him?
Hear me out.
If you and I were together, and we got in a fight, and I came over, and I was totally naked, and I was like Do whatever you want to me.  Be as dirty as you want, you wouldn't like that?  If I was totally naked.
Ohmygod, it's so good.
Yeah.
Ohmy- you can't tell him that I'm here.
They are.
I came here to make you these cookies.
Ye-yeah.
Yeah.
You're awesome.
You're awesomer.
What say we go back to your place and eat these in private?
Hello?
Huh?
I can't hear you come upstairs. I'll buzz you in.
It's open
What?
I am calm!
K, coming.
Hey!
What?
I have a boyfriend
I don't know I'm really confused now
I think I'm gonna go by myself. I have a decision to make
Hey.
So, I made my decision.
It was really tough. Jake, you're so thoughtful and smart and really cute... so I choose you!
No.
Yeah.
I chose Jake!
No. No. Listen, I'm... I'm really sorry.
So...
I feel like such a bitch.
Now for everyone else.
Hola.
Como est, como est.
Que?
What did I miss?
Porque.
I spent nine days getting the lay of the land. Then on the tenth day I left my hotel room and got badly... badly lost.
Como una promesa, eres tu! ERES TU!
It hurt more yesterday, yes. My entire face was in a blister.
Yes, just a small, small leetle bit of an accent.
I was lost for many moons, and many suns.
Yes, 17 moons, and oddly 21 suns.
Well maybe I missed some moons, yeah.
Yeah, cause I fall asleep at nighttime.
Do you want your souvenir or not, I had to smuggle it.
Let me just pass it through me, sanitize it, and give it back to you.
S. S seor.
Yes.
I cannot sit down it hurts too much.
S s yes.
I got you a real authentican Mexican sombrero.
Ah s, actually don't touch me because it's EXPANDING IN ME! Ohh-
We go bar for bar -- see who can eat the most candy.
a new fiance, because his is broken. Does anybody have the number for the slut store? I left mine in Darren's dick LOL. What does that mean?
mother  Jake and Amir.
NO.
Whoa. Awwwww...
You gotta give me a sip of that.
You gotta give me some of that so-da.
Gimme a sip of that so-da.
SODA SAYS GIMME A SIP, YOU WILL.
C'mon, man, you gotta gimme a sip of that soda; I don't wanna ask twice.
Yeah, not so TERRIBLE that you didn't recognize it was Yoda.
Nice catch, Jay Buhner!
What are you, a major-league right baseball player -
Yeah, but not so wrong that you didn't recognize -
IT'S NOT A DIARY. It's a journal. Now, gimme my diary back, please.
Now gimme a sip! I gave you a diary, you give me a -
What do you want me to do, man? You want me to just...move?
Yeah, you want me to just tele - heliport.
It's a thing. You go -
Gimme a sip, man.
What are you, impressed?
Yo, this is my love song, and it goes like -
Fine...
Hey, thanks ASIAN for the invite last night!
I just really needed to get out of the house, so I appreciate it.
...Is this like an inside joke based on something that happened, because I'm sorry, I was a little bit gone.
Yeah, I say a LOT of funny things.
I thought the party needed a new energy, okay?!  Sometimes nights are about what kind of energy you're able to infuse -
I had just drained the main vein...like 25 seconds earlier.
A lot of the girls last night were slumpbusters, can we talk about THAT for a second?
That reminds me; that slumpbusting sasquatch owes me a five-spot. An Abe Lincolner.
You probably think, you think you're cooler than me.
...no...
I HAD JUST DRAINED -
...Vaguely?
I'm sorry, is there a point to this story?
Why don't you ask me why I'M mad, okay?! You take me to a slumpbuster festival, I haven't gotten any in like weeks - I'm on a 2-month dry spell - and EVERYBODY is outta my league.
THEY'RE BOTH, OKAY. I'm a 1, and they're 3s!!
No, you stop and listen to PEE.
I just drained the main vein like a DAY ago. On a CAKE, lest you forget.
Guys! Guys! Stop it, stop it!
I'mI'm not a ghost?  OH!
I'm Lerona's twin sister.
I'm Jessica.
Okay, well
What, uh
No
Anyway!
What?
Yeah, well, so are you two!  I mean, youyou act like a four-year-old in a twenty-eight-year-old's body.
And youJake, you stole your best friend's girlfriend, and then you killed her.
Oh, and by the way, fedoras are not stylin'.
Because I'm not Lerona's twin, okay? I am a ghost. I came back here to see what nice things you guys would be saying about me, and instead, you're flirting with my fake sibling and talking shit about me.
You know what? Whatevers. Bye.
We're not transparent, you know! It really hurt.
It did.
It did.
Woah, pervert alert!
We don't serve alcohol.
Sure.
So, you want two shots of espresso, one ice coffee. Do you want room?
We don't serve beer.
Sorry guys, I have other customers.
We're cash only.
Cash is fine.
Alright, you guys gotta pick your name for Secret Santa.
Out of a hat.
Fine.
Yeah, he didn't even get you.
You're already crying.
Me. That's right, you're looking at a modern day robin hood, I steal from the bitch and give to the whore.
So sad.
Yeah.
Yeah, I did.
Horrible.
Are you okay?
...Yeah.
Um...
...It was fine,
Well, I kinda get the sense that you make those jokes a lot...
Well maybe he was just fed up, and... didn't want to be here anymore.
Well I also got the sense that he didn't want to be here to begin with, so...
It's fine, Chloe. It's gonna be fine.
Thanks for coming. Nobody wants to see indie movies anymore.
Jake!
Oh my god!
Jake! His-
-dick is in my face!
Julia.
Oh my god...
Whoah, what is that?
Why is he trying to put his face in your crotch?
Hey!
No, it doesn't hurt.
What? Are you trying to pick me up?
I actually have a really big crush on... Amir.
Ooh, what's up, you're a real rap star. J: Shut up.
What are you doing?
There was a company-wide meeting and you weren't there and people got concerned because they haven't seen you around the office!
Uh, you okay?
Why don't you take a break from playing this g-
You haven't beat the game yet, you have one objective le-

Say it. Say it to our face.
Mine!
