She's unconscious, and she's not waking up, I don't know what's gonna happen.

I'm just so scared.
What the?
I am having lunch with my sister.
I'll give you a minute.
Really?
Amir, Jake. A word.
You guys, seriously, how many times do I have to tell you not to talk to my sister?  YOU had your chance;  You left her in the middle of a park during your date!
What are you doing?!
Just leave that on, you guys are both disgusting, god.
Don't!
Jake, Amir wants you to know he's not talking to you anymore.
Jake, Amir wants you to know he's a needy idiot and needs to know everything about your life. Also, does not know how to pronounce et cetera.
Whoa, Jake, did you know Amir has a huge crush on me?
Just.. shut up.
There's no one here named Quincy, Amir.
Just shut up!
Oh, Amir stole it and put it on Jake's desk.
Are you okay?
So good.
I know, me too.
No. So . . .
Yeah, sure. What's up?
What do you-what do you mean, what do I think?
I don't know. I mean Jake still gets really annoyed.
Well, that's true. And, I mean, Amir like sleeps over Jake's house constantly.
That's so true. You know, if you didn't know them and you're explaining them to someone, you could almost make an argument that they're like . . .
I mean they're probably not, but it kind of seems like . . .
. . . like they're gay lovers.
I mean, I'm just saying. I mean, the family visits, the sleepovers, they're always getting into these like lover's quarrels.
Yeah, I mean . . . maybe. It's stupid, it's probably wrong, but...
Yeah.
No, it's OK. It's--
It's fine. I mean, I just thought we weren't going to, uh...
I mean, or ever.
I mean--
Amir, you're yelling!
Center cup!
Thank you!
Oh, I totally get it!
Can I kiss the magician?
No...
No one's gonna have candy or anything.
Obviously.
We'll get it to you later, okay?

It's Tuesday....
I can't tell if this is a family photo or if it's just you.
We're laughing about this.
Are you calling *me* fat?
Yeah seriously Amir, don't make fun of me, I don't want anyone to know I had food for breakfast.
You're right, it's like drinking ice cream and milk at the same time.
I'm leaving!
Yeah.
Man, I can't believe you like the meatballs at Ikea; that stuff's like Swedish prison food!
Oh, I didn't know you took French! That's good!
Jake, c'mon, just explain it to him.
Yeah but who's Julian Assange?
Yeah--
Anyway, Amir, Julian Assange is the founder of Wikileaks, this website, and he recently got arrested for sexual assault on a Swedish warrant, so. It's kinda like an international--
iPad.
None taken.
I think you're overreacting, Jake.
That's--
Yeah you do do that Jake. You cut people off like, a lot. It's really...
You're not even close.
He was hiding.
Who?
Chris Nowth.
No, you just keep talking about this.
Hey!
How much do we owe you?
What the deluxe package?
Amir, you told us you were just going to get him headphones.
OK, it's fine. How much do we owe you?
Stop saying deluxe package.
Fourteen six?
OK, Amir, we're not paying you $14,000!
Jake, Amir bought you this really expensive birthday present and --
--now he's--
Umm, listen Jake--

jake: OH, I hate you guys!  What the hell?!
GOTCHA! It's pudding!
Yeah, it does...
Why.. would you do that?
Yeah.
OH!

Well-
I have the same--
Rage issues, or?--
So gross...
Meaning?
Yeah I can smell it.
You weren't even invited!
No.
count the ways you are thinking within, thoughts ,within thoughts, I lost count.  That's the point.  I can't count worth shit because I forget how number work when you're around because you are blazin'.  Love, J-Witz.  What is this?    This is so weird.
Geez, no, ah, stop, no!
Now tonight, you drop your g-string.  Let me see that crack, Girl.  I bet it's not whack, Girl?  Amir, that's so sweet.
Jesus, where did that- where did that even come from?
