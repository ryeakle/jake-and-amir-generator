amir: Alright, I thought of a good idea for a-vimeo and that's, it's called quick characters, where I create a character and then I ssh put the camera on Jake or he creates a character and he puts the camera on me.
amir: A guy who didn't, who just didn't get a raise but bet somebody the amount of the raise that he wouldn't get it. So he's a little disappointed from a career standpoint but he's still gonna get the money from a friend.
jake: 
amir: What happened?
jake: Ugh, bullshit, really . Uhh, didn't get the raise. Butts. You owe me nineteen hundred dollars.
amir:  Why is that?
jake: So we ...we gotta bet.
amir: Nah, I was just kdding about that.
jake: I bet you that I wasn't gonna get a raise.
amir: Oh, no. I was sort of kidding about that.
jake: I have to call my wife. Uhm, just...write me a check or whatever.
amir: I'm not gonna write you a check.
jake: Fifteen hundred dollars.
amir: Okay.
jake: Somebody eh at an av Avril Lavigne concert uhm pretending they know all the lyrics to complicated.
amir: Why gotta go make things so difficult for me. You don't act to three. One two.  Sbray Nga-I don't want it too. One, I'll be in the car.
amir: A guy who takes a drink out of his water and it taste like his own urine, and he wants to tell people that it taste like his own urine but he can't because then he would have to explain the fact that he's one drinks, that he's once drink his own pee and he doesn't wanna do that.
jake:  This taste...

jake: It taste like...cruUud.
jake: Guy who is been secretly collecting playboy magazines for twenty-five years and tries to sell them all of them on ebay without his wife knowing.

I'm being completely serious right now. If you're not gonna take it seriously, I don't even wanna be part of this thing. Like I just hanged out to this project because I thought you were gonna help produce it, but you're not gonna help produce it . Ha ha!
THE END
EPISODE LINK
amir: All right, this is a 30 second debate between myself and Jake. Uh, Jake. What do you think about global warming? Do you think humans can slow it down or is it just an unstoppable force? Should we not even bother? Should we be like, You know what? I'm gonna drive my car and I'm gonna eat my gasoline and I'm gonna do whatever I want because I'm an american?
jake: Incoherent fast talking
amir: I can't. I can't...let's do that again. I can't hear you when you do like fast forward talking. So just talk normal.
jake: More fast talking
amir: laughs You did it again. You talked..you talked like super fast, and I can't..nobody's gonna understand you.
jake: More fast talking
amir: laughs All right, let's just...stop it. Let's just do it later, 'cause I'm..I'm running late, so I have to go anyway. 
amir: Stop it! I'm seriously late! 
amir: You're so annoying!
END
notes:
Jake's fast talking can be understood when the video is slowed down.
first response: First of all, people don't eat gasoline. That's just a common misconception. And personally? I think we should just..let loose, you know? Drive our cars into the ozone layer. Eat garbage. Poop anywhere we want, like...the earth is fucked, and we're all going to be dead by the time global warming really takes effect, so, what's the point, right?
second response: I..I was talking pretty normally. I didn't...really don't think I did anything..like fast forwarding? That's..what the hell does that even mean?
third response: That's absurd. Not true at all. I don't..I'm talking  very normal speed right now.
jake: Hey, Amir. What are you doing?
amir: I'm growing a beerd.
jake: What's a beerd?
amir: Well, you know what a beard is right?
jake: Yeah.
amir: So a beerd is like a beard, but made out of beer .
jake: Oh...
amir: It's...beerd .
jake: Kind of like a spork is a spoon and a fork?
amir: Exactly.
jake: Now I get it.
jake: You shouldn't do this.
amir: It's, honestly, I'm like half-way done. It's almost over, practically.
jake: The joke--the joke is in the spelling of beerd.
amir: It's--look at me! It's too late! It doesn't matter if it's the spelling, it's too late.
jake: It's then--it's not gonna work.
amir: It is gonna work, just stop--
jake: Let's do quick characters.
amir: Jason, you weren't supposed to see this. Get out!
jason:  Send me a fax when I can pee.
amir: Or--or anything. I'll send you an email or a fax. Let's do that again.
amir: Jake, can I trust you?
jake: Yeah, what?
jake:  Dude!
jake: I feel like such shit, you trusted me and I let you down.
Amir  I- I can't feel my..
jake: So pimp. It's just so fucking pimp. Soaring like a majestic eagle or something. Like, that's it, right up in the air, that's my
kite. I'm not even explaining it right cause I'm so amped still. Like your adrenaline is pumping, it's just in the sky and you just
don't let go, you can't let go of the kite. It's just the best feeling when you just see it. And the wind blowing and shit. The
unraveling spool. So phat, you don't even know. The phattest fucking thing in the world. Flying that kite, I owned it. I was owning,
all day long, all morning. Starting in the morning then to the afternoon just owning a kite. Owning the sky. It was so fucking sick.
Sprinting across the grass. Picturing it now it almost brings a fucking tear to my eye. People? it wasn't happening, but it felt like
people were cheering, just like ahh! ahhh!. You're just out there and trying?
amir: What are you talking about?
jake: Nothing. Nothing.
amir: What was so awesome?
jake: Nothing.
amir: Talking about something.
jake: No... I flew a kite, is what it was.
amir: Huh?
jake: I flew a kite this weekend.
amir: Are you kidding?
jake: Well, I wish I was kidding. My sister wanted to or some shit like that. So... it's just like... homo. Of course I didn't like it,
it's fucking... it was a kite!
amir: So you don't like to kite.
jake: No.
amir: Okay. You scared me!
jake:  Just kidding, it was so fucking pimp.
amir:  Ughhhhh...
jake:  What's going on?
amir: I don't know how people do it.
jake: Yeah.
amir: No, you don't know what I meant. I meant, I don't know how people get tattoos.
jake: Man. What time do we have that meeting? It's like, 4? Or 2?
amir: Just, forget about the meeting, how-- When you got your tattoo, did it hurt you? Who else has a tattoo in the office? Now that I'm inked up.
jake: I don't really...
amir: Now that I have ink.
jake: Do you know, just like, when--
amir: You're treating me so different now that you know that I have a tattoo.
jake: I'm really trying not to.
amir: It's embarrassing telling you this shit because I don't-- I don't want--
jake: You don't- you don't have to.
jake: What is it of?
amir: I dunno, it's a tattoo.
amir: Okay, what is this?  What is that of? That's not of anything, but it's still a tattoo.
jake: That looks like a fish or something. Is that what you got?
amir: Mine's a bear. Okay?
jake: A bear? Where is it? Where did you--?
amir: I dunno, in the woods or something.
jake: When you get a tattoo, you get it of something and in a specific spot. So, it's of a bear, you said, and where is it?
amir: Let's get-- let's go to a fucking bar.
amir: I haven't felt this interrogated--  get-
amir: It's not on my shoulder or anything, it's just like on my.. area. What does it matter?
jake: What area?
amir: What does it matter where it is?
jake: Let me see it! 
jake: Is that a dick.. on your... stomach?--
amir: Is that a dick? No, it's a cannon. Leave me alone, I-- it's- it's getting sore! 
jake:  Let me fucking see that!
amir: Get off of me, man.
amir:  tattoo of a penis with GAY written below it) Get off of me! What does it matter what it is?
jake: It says GAY'!
amir:  Those are my initials!
amir: Next one's gonna be like an eagle.
amir:  A3. D2. D4.
jake: Okay, you sunk my Milky Way.
amir:  So fucking sick.
jake: Can we stop? I'm down like eight bucks.
amir: We'll stop when the machine's empty. B2!
amir: I think you should leave.
jake: Ok. 
amir:  Hah! I tied your shoes together.
jake:  Fuck you, dude...
amir: : Fuck me, huh?
jake: : I'm sorry, I really-- I didn't mean anything--
amir: I'm trying to play a joke and Fuck you, man, that's all I get back? I'm sorry, wow. I'm a dick for playing a joke. On my friend.
jake: I didn't mean it like that...
amir: Someone I thought was my friend, at least.
jake: ...uh...
amir: Why are you untying your shoes? That means the joke's over, that means our relationship's over. When you fell over, I laughed, because I respected you. How wrong I was. Shame on me.
jake:  You know what, let's...  why don't we just talk about i-- 
amir:  I don't even wanna talk about it.
jake: Aah!  Fun... funny!...
amir: Funny, right?
jake:  Yeah...
amir: So act, act like it's funny.
jake: Good one... What do you want me to say, it really fucking hurt!
amir: And there's that effort again! You didn't... Forget it. 
End
amir: So drunk...
jake: You're drunk right now?
amir: Last night I got so drunk...
jake: Ah... you... nice.
amir: I had like, so many beers.
jake: How many? How many is so many?
amir: I was like retarded...
jake: How many beers did you have?
amir: ... Sixty.
jake: Sixty? That's... Sixty is way too many. That's not a believable number at all.
amir:  I know... How many is believable?
jake: Twelve?
amir: I know, twelve... I had twelve.
jake : I had twelve?
amir: I had twelve beers, yeah. Ssstupid afterwards.
jake: Yeah, I don't believe you. I don't think you know... I don't think you've had a beer, ever.
amir : Yeah, right. I drink it all the time.
jake: So what does it taste like?
amir: Sweet. So sweet. Like sug-- What?
jake: It's not sweet. Like sugar?
amir : No!  No. It tastes not like sugar, it tastes like the opposite.
jake: Closer. Like what?
amir: Just like you're drinking... like you're drinking a sourdough baguette.
jake: No, no, it doesn...  It's not that either.
amir: Here's two... That was two things it doesn't taste like.
jake: Exactly, so what does it taste like?
amir: It tastes... you know... Beer is water, it's like a fermentable starch source, alright?...
jake: Ok... 
amir : ...like malted barley, yeast, it's common for flavoring to be added--
jake : ...like hops, a mixture of starch sources to be used with a secondary starch source.  Yeah. Uh, you're on the wikipedia page. I'm reading it too.
amir: You are?
jake : Rice and sugar often being turned into junk, especially when used with...
amir : Uh, yeah, I see where you're at, but I wasn't reading it.
jake: You see where I'm at, but you weren't reading it?
amir: Why, what are you, what're you doing tonight? How many beers are you gonna have? I'll double it, easy.
jake: I'm not drinking tonight, I have to take my cat to the vet, actually.
amir: Take a drink before or after, whatever you drink--
jake: She's having, uh, she has heart palpitations and they might have to put her down.
amir: ...So sick.
End
jake: What are you doing?
amir: Oh, I'm writing an email, cause a friend of mine emailed me.
jake: You know what I mean.
amir: Yeah, he was like writing me an email, so I'm emailing him back
jake: I put on sunglasses and then you put on, like, the exact same pair.
amir: Not the exact same pair. Yours are yellow, right? I can'tyeah, they're yellow.
jake: It's, like, the idea of putting on sunglasses.
amir: Oh the idea. I didn'tyeah I didn't know you invented sunglasses. That'sI guess that's why I messed up because I didn't know you invented sunglasses. Why are you even still working here? Can't you live off the royalties of wearing
jake: You know what I mean. Just, I put on sunglasses and then you did.
amir: Why are you wearing a blue shirt today? I'm wearing a blue shirt, and your new rule is that nobody can wear the same thing, right? So, I can't wear a blue shirt if you are?
jake: Okay, well yesterday, when I wore these sunglasses, you called them gay. So. And you don't even own a pair of sunglasses.
amir: Yesterday they were gay. But then people said that they liked it, so I got a pair of my own. I mean, I'm allowed to change my mind.
jake: No, now you're just admitting that you're a poser, because you got something because other people liked it.
amir: I'm getting a call.
jake: Your phone didn't ring.
amir: It's on vibrate mode.
jake: You have your office phone on vibrate?
amir: Yeah, it's like call-forwarding, so itI don't really know how it wor Hello? Hello? Ah, shh, I lost her.
jake: It doesn't go right to dial tone when you lose somebody.

jake: Hey Amir.
jake: That's good. You win. Tie, or whatever. I just have to answer this email. One sec. I'm dead! Done. Alright. Stop for one second, I just gotta make a phone call. Mom? Hey, did you call me before?
jake: I have to call you back.
amir: Oh, I forgot to tell you. I thought of the chillest screen name last night. It was so chill. It's like the chillest thing I've
ever thought of, and it was a screen name, can you believe it? Don't you at least want to know what it is?
jake: Oh sorry. Yeah, what is it?
amir: It's chilldude22. Two-two. Chill dude two-two.
jake: It's actually pretty tight.
amir: I know. It's so good.
jake: That's actually really tight.
amir: It's fly as hell. That's why I love it so much.
jake: I mean, I dunno. I think, I mean all your friends know you on your screen name that you have
amir: I know, but it's not a big deal if I'm just, like, putting uplike, throw up an away mess, and I'm just like, Hey I changed my
name to, like, something super chill. I'm sure people will understand.
jake: Well, I mean was it available?
amir: Jesus, actually no, it's not.
jake: I'm not surprised.
amir: Damn, that's like the chillest one I've ever thought of!
jake: That's tough.
amir: It's more than tough.
jake: Sorry.
amir: You know, I'm gonna add the name chilldude22 to my bumy BL, and I'm gonna check out if this chill guy wants to swap.
jake: If I had a screen name that chill I definitely wouldn't trade it with anybody.
amir: Whoa, he's actually online.
jake: Really?
amir: Maybe I should IM him and ask him if he wants to switch. Hey.  Wanna swap names? (Jake's
computer makes an IM sound) What's going on? Hello? Hi. It's you, man!
jake: Honestly, if I thought of a screen name that chill I wouldn't have told anybody until I'd already made it.
amir: Did you steal my chill screen name?!
jake: I'm just trying to pimp out this chill pro right now. What's that Jovi quote?
amir: I mean, I'm gonna tell you what it is because it's such a chill quote that it belongs with that screen name, but: She says we
gotta hold on to what we got cause it doesn't make a difference if we make it or not. How could you do that? Like, you know I thought
that was the chillest.
jake: What's Streeter's handle? I need to add him. I'm trying to flesh out this BL right now.
amir: I'm supposed to be the chill dude.
jake: Chill out, dude. All's fair in love and chill, you know that.
amir: We did it!
jake: Hell yeah we did!
jake: What was that?
amir: Torn. Just this, it's like about a guy who just walks around beating people up. And he like, stabs people in the neck and then just plays with blood. And beats the shit outta people for fun. Hwoh, hwoh.  I figure for high five, we just come down, and it's like Nothing's right. We're torn.
jake: A girl wrote it. And a girl sings it. It's about a girl who got broken up with by a guy.
amir: I put it on my workout mix cause it's like so, it's just core. Just... 
jake: You don't go to the gym.
amir: No, but... Come, on let's do just one more high five, we'll choose like the manliest song,  it'll be about like the Terminator or something, just like, killing people, one more time! Up high! Super sick! Let's do this!
amir: Come on, man!
jake: Come on!
End
As a side note, this is one of the episodes in which Amir wears the SILF t-shirt.
jake : Uh, yeah, July 1st. I'll be home.
amir: : 180... 180.  Get off the phone, man. We're at work.
jake : Uhm...
amir: We're not supposed to use the phone at work.
jake: : Alright, can I, do you think I can just call you back grandma?. Alright. Love you. Bye.
amir: What's the best you can get on an IQ test?
jake: 200?
amir: 180 is pretty good though, right? Highly gifted it says...
jake: What're you talking about?
amir: I took an online IQ test, I got a 180. Pretty...
jake: Did you deduct 50 points?
amir : Uhm, no, why?
jake: For being dumb enough to take an online IQ test?
amir: Psht, no. It didn't say that. It didn't say to.
jake: How many questions were there?
amir: 10. So hard.
jake: Alright, ask me one.
amir : 'If you turn a right glove inside out, would it fit on your left hand?'
jake: Yeah.
amir: Wrong.
jake: No, that's right.
amir: Ok yeah, that's the one I got wrong. So 9 out of 10. That's... still pretty sick...
jake :  Let me see'em.
amir: I mean, look...  They're so... You wouldn't be able to get any of these...
jake: There's only 7 questions there.
amir: Yeah, first 3 were on a banner ad. So...
jake: Sounds like a scam.
amir: We'll see what the scam is when I get my diploma.
jake: So you have to pay for that diploma, right?
amir: 49 bucks, but it comes in a sick frame.
jake: Right, that sounds like that's the scam. You're paying for something that doesn't mean anything.
amir: Psh, it doesn't mean anything... I'd like to see... I'd, I'd onestly like to see how you do.
jake: Ok, fine. Send me the link.
amir: Only people who get 180 or more even get the opportunity to buy the diploma, so I don't see why I shouldn't.
jake : Wow, this is really easy.
amir: It's not... Seems easy, but it's not...
jake: This is REALLY easy. You only got a 180?
jake: What the hell?
jake: You turned off my monitor?
amir: Figure it out. If you're so smart... You think you can get a better than a 180, you could figure who turned off your monitor.
jake: I did figure it out and it was you, you turned off my monitor.
amir: Not saying it was, not saying it wasn't.
jake: Can you just plug it in? I have to do, I have to do work.
amir: Let's make a deal.
amir: If I plu-
jake : Already plugged it back in.
amir: Huh?
jake: I already plugged it back in. It's fine.  Just got a text message. From you. '180'.
amir: I dunno. Was it me?
jake: Yeah, it was. It says... it says who texted you.
amir: Yeah, I mean, sometimes it says 'Restricted'.
jake: Yeah, sometimes, if you press the right buttons it says 'Restricted'.
amir: Maybe.
jake: Not maybe. It just does.
amir:  ...So smart.
End
amir: Hey. Dinner. Tonight. 8 o'clock.
jake: Ah, no thanks. I'm pretty tired.
amir: Ice cream? You want ice cream?
jake: No.
amir: Probably can't... probably can't get ice cream unless you finish your dinner.
jake: Well, yeah. I said no to both, so...
amir: Come on, man. Don't be some loser who stays at home.
jake: Fine. Sorry.
amir: I'm sorry, listen. I shouldn't have called you a loser. Let me come over, make dinner, we'll eat it together, I feel like a huge... I feel like a dick ever since I made fun of you.
jake: Honestly, don't worry about it. Forget it.
amir: Like I know you're just trying to be polite or whatever. I'm not gonna take no for an answer.
jake: Take no for an answer. I don't want you to come tonight.
amir: What's your favorite beer?
jake: Listen, I just, I don't want to do anything tonight, but I'll answer your question; it's Stella. But don't come over.
amir: Comin' over with a twelver of it.
jake: Ok, you're not listening to me. I really don't feel like doing anything tonight. I'm sorry.
amir: Come on, let's do something together for once.
jake: Uh, god. I'm just really tired, I want to get home, I feel like shit. If you absolutely have to come over, then...
amir: Sweet! I'll come over at 8. Vodka and Red Dogs. Ruff! Auuuuuu!
jake: Do you mean Red Bull?
amir: Yeah. That's how I do a bull, it's so weird. It's like 'ruff'.
jake: But you also said dog.
amir: ...... Ruff!
jake: Forget it.
jake: That part's so funny. It's really funny. Go back, play it one more time. The look on your face is priceless. That part's so funny, just rewind it; just watch that one part again.
amir: Let me just finish editing the whole thing, and then we'll watch it all. Instead of watching individual part by part, we'll just watch it all at the end.
jake: But your face in that one part is just priceless. I have a really good idea; if you just take a screencap of that one part, and then we'll take it into MS paint, and write something like 'Box of  Popcorn: $4.99, Movie from Blockbuster: $2.99, Amir's face at this part: Priceless.'
amir: Those have been done. I mean, we're not gonna make a Mentos ad anytime soon.
jake: Right. When's the last time you saw a face look that priceless?
amir: The thing is, you can't put a price on faces, so every face, like that face, is priceless.
jake: What about this one?
amir: That face is, like they're all, they're all priceless regardless.
jake: Give me a price on this face.
amir: I'm not gonna look.
jake: Ok, I have a really good idea for a new one, check it. Like take a whole, entire bag of pretzels, and you tear it open and you just put it on your face like .
amir: You know how yesterday, when I was like 'you probably don't get it', like, when you make stuff, like when you make suggestions like that, I'm pretty sure you don't get any of these jokes. Like, what's funny about this one?
jake: Kites are gay.
amir: No. It's not it.
jake: Ask me one and I'll tell you the joke.
amir: Why is the high-five one funny?
jake: Because torn is gay.
amir: No, it's not... the joke is never
jake: Ok, are you going to deny that torn is gay?
amir: The joke is never because blank is gay. That's never the joke. It's not because kite is...
jake : It helps. It helps the joke.
amir: It doesn't even... it's not even part of the joke.
jake: Rewind this one.
amir: Stop! Listen, I come up with the ideas, I edit it, and then you do the other parts.
jake: What's the matter? Are you tired? I'll do this.
amir: Hey Jake.
jake: Ch-ch-poooh.
amir: What's that?
jake: Just start the song.
amir: Ok. I didn't get why you did the gun thing, then.
jake: Forget it.
When I was, a young boy, my father, took me into the city, to see a marching band.
He said 'son when, you grow up, would you be, the savior of the broken, the beaten and the damned? He said-
Will you, defeat them, your demons, and all the non believers, the plans that they have made?'
Because one day, I'll leave you, a phantom, to lead you in the summer, to join the Black Parade.
jake: Don't do the guitar, I'm doing the guitar.
amir: I'll do it.
jake: I started it first, man. I'll do the drums.
amir: You do drums.
jake: Fine. Do that, but that's bass.
amir: Not, it's not. It's not bass. It's not a bass.
jake: You're doing guitar again.
amir: I'm not!
Sometimes I get the feeling she's watching over me.
And other times I feel like I should go.
And through it all, the rise and fall, the bodies in the streets.
And when you're gone we want you all to know.
We'll carry on,
We'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone believe me
Your memory will carry on
We'll carry on
And in my heart I can't contain it
The anthem won't explain it.
A world that sends you reeling from decimated dreams
Your misery and hate will kill us all.
So paint it black and take it back
Let's shout it loud and clear
Defiant to the end we hear the call
To carry on
We'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone believe me
Your memory will carry on
We'll carry on
And though you're broken and defeated
Your weary widow marches-
jake: I just realized we're listening to 2 separate songs.
amir: That's funny.
jake: Well, yeah, it's weird more than anything.
We'll carry on, we'll carry on
amir:  A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.
jake: What? What are you taking about?
amir: Just a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. It's one of those days.
jake: What are you referring to?
amir: I'm not referring to anything, it's just like a.. it's like a proverb. You just say it when there's silence in the room just to say something.
jake: That's not how those work. They all mean something.
amir: They don't--none of them mean anything, you just say them, like Don't count your chickens before they hatch! or something.
jake: No, that means something. That means not to like expect too much of anything.
amir: Yeah, that one means--that one probably means something but like all these other ones don't like mean anything, like Keep your nose to the grindstone! or whatever.
jake: That means like to work hard.
amir: Well you come up with one that doesn't mean anything then!
jake: I couldn't. They all mean something.
amir: Not all of them. Not all of them.
jake:  Yeah.
amir: Let me explain it to you. I don't think I'm explaining it right. If I'm sitting here in silence and you're also sitting there, I'll just be like Don't get up on the wrong side of the bed this morning! and then you'll be like  whatever you tip your cap or whatever.
jake: Do you honestly think that's how proverbs work?
amir: Pssshhh.
jake: Forget it. I'm just gonna ignore you the rest of the day.
amir: Don't make a mountain out of a molehill.
jake: Alright. You're right. See? Makes sense.
amir: That doesn't mean anything.
jake: Nevermind.

amir: Um, alright..I was talking to Ricky yesterday and he made it clear to me that one of our jobs was in danger.
jake: Yours.
amir: Yeah, mine...specifically.
jake: So why didn't--why didn't you just say yours?
amir: My job is in danger I just wanted to make this like a team thing..I know that if I got fired you'd come with me.
jake: 
amir: So I wrote down some ideas because I know..yeah we can work here at College Humor til we're like sixty-five but we should always be thinking about the next......
jake:  The next what? Do you want me to..?
amir: The next......
jake: Am I supposed to finish that sentence for you?
amir: Alright, first idea. You know how Barry Bonds is in the home run thing? Like he's about to break the record?
jake: Yeah.
amir: So, this website would text you when he hits the big one, when he hits number seven-fifty-five.
jake: Uh, no that's stupid.
amir: Okay. Second idea is if you loved the Barry Bonds idea--
jake: Okay so just skip this one then.
amir: Okay.
jake: 'Cause the Barry Bonds idea was no good.
amir: Okay. Okay. It would text you whenever anybody hits a homerun.
amir: Facebook for college students. So it's like a Facebook site but just for college students.
jake: Yeah, that one's not gonna work just because, uh, Facebook already kind of has you know, every--all the college students--
amir: Okay, just say..if you don't like something just say next 'cause it's a long list and I don't wanna waste your time.
jake: Okay.
amir: And you don't wanna waste mine.
amir: Global internet. Portal site.
jake: Next.
amir: Discount electronics.
jake: Uh, yeah. Sounds like a standard idea. It's not bad.
amir: Okay, so let's discuss. I'll put a star by it and then let's talk. I was thinking five dollar digital cameras at first.
jake: Okay, so....
amir: Two dollar DVD players.
jake: So you don't get how businesses work.
amir: This one's actually kind of cool it's--you step on your laptop and it weighs you. It tells you how much you weigh like a scale.
jake: Okay so next.
amir: Scale.com
jake: Nope.
amir: Okay next one is...nicknames everybody loves them, nobody has them. I don't know what that meant. Any idea?
jake: Nope. It's your list. Just cross it off don't check it. There you go.
amir: Funny chinese names.
jake: I mean, that's offensive and not a good idea.
amir: Uh, an alphabetical database.
jake: Of what?
amir: Anything.
jake: Next.
amir: Okay.
amir: Uh, IMDb but no actors. Just the movies.
jake: So it's worse IMDb.
amir: Yes.
jake: No.
amir: Alright, a website that says God bless you or Gesundheit for when people sn--
jake: No good.
amir: ...sneeze around the office. No good or good?
jake: No good.
amir: Okay, say that don't mumble.  Can you hear what I'm saying now or not 'cause I'm mumbling?
jake: I can.
amir: Okay.
amir: Okay this one's actually kind of neat. It's a telephone for deaf people. So when--
jake: Next.
amir: So when deaf people cannot use the PHONE--let me finish! It's so frustrating! I know you're not doing it on purpose but--
amir: I just have a couple..a couple more.
jake: You know I should actually..I should get back to work this is what Ricky doesn't like. So...I'm just gonna...  We'll leave it at that.
amir: Um, okay I have like--
jake: See you have a few pages, just--
amir: I have--
jake: Mail those to me?
amir: Yeah, okay. Yeah.
jake: Alright, cool. Good luck.
amir: Should I..that's fine. Should I gmail? Or send it to your hotmail?
jake: Uh, g--yeah send it to..send it to my hotmail.
amir: Okay.
jake: Later.
amir: Wait, one more!
jake: No.
amir: Online paper?
jake: I'm already out of here.

amir: Can i least show you what the wrestling move would have looked like, if you didn't ruin it.
jake:Absolutely not.
amir: The thing is you were scared last time, if you could just conquer that fear, I think, it will look, really, really boss.
jake:You probably should have explained to me that you were going to do a wresting move, and explain to me what I was supposed to do, right?
jake:That's what your supposed to do...
amir: Uh, your head goes in between my thighs and I suplex you off the table, and, listen my knees will hit the floor before your face, so don't brace your fall.
jake:I'm not letting you do any wrestling moves on me, you obviously can't do them correctly.
amir: I mean that splint is just as much your fault as it is mine, if not more yours because you're the one that actually put his wrist down
jake:Don't talk to me anymore

jake: I mean, have you ever taken voice lessons?
amir: I mean, I did choir in, like, fifth grade.
jake: Wow.
amir: But not 'cuz I wanted to, because my mom said I had to do something after school, and I didn't want to do basketball 'cuz I was too good, not because I like singing.
jake: No, it shows. You should, I mean you should walk around the office more and just sing in front of people.
amir: Who would walk around singing?
jake: Yeah.
amir : Build up your confidence and you can be on time for once. Wake up, who cares about-

amir: No duh. Like I want to be good at singing. That's a gay sport.
amir: Mom, you are not coming up here. You do not come up here. That is so un-ace of you.
amir: Of course you wouldn't get what that means. It's an inside joke between me and my bestest friend in the world.
amir: Listen, if you come up here, you're going to embarrass me, you're gonna embarrass me more than you've ever embarrassed me before.
amir: Just leave the cake with the security guard downstairs and I'll get it on my way home. Bye.

jake: Was that your mom? You talk like that to your mother?
amir: You don't get it, man. She's embarrassing as hell.

jake: That's awesome! Cake... everybody here likes cake. Why would that be embarrassing?
amir: You don't get it. That's...
jake: I brought my mom up here like two weeks ago.
amir: Honestly, and I wasn't going to say anything, just-
jake : Don't say it.
amir: Ok. You just, you look like a gaylord.
jake: Don't be a dick, alright?
amir: Ok. Classic example. Freshman year, she sends me cookies in the mail because it's was my birthday, right? I couldn't throw them away, I had to flush them down the toilet because I was afraid everybody would see them.
jake: What's wrong with that?
amir: Ugh, hold on a second. What? Oh my god, I don't need a laptop, I already told you. Just give it to the maid, I honestly... Goodbye.
jake: What the hell is wrong with you?
amir: It's like... do you have anyone in your life that just pisses you off, annoys you so much you wish you could just tell them off?
jake: Yes.
amir: But you secretly love them?
jake: No.

ben: Oh, we've been good, we've been good.
ben: So, Q2 reviews have been handed in. Um, peer reviews also have come in.
ben: Listen, we're not exactly concerned about your work, um, there are, however, some red flags that we've seen.
jake: Which is why I wanted to show you my portfolio, which I-
ben : No, I didnt- Look, we've seen that, and that's fine, but what we did want to talk to you about is-

amir: Meetings are gay. Dilbert was right.
jake: What's up, man?
amir: Hey.
jake: Eating by yourself like a fucking loser, huh?
amir: Yeah.
jake: You're a fucking joke, Blumenfeld, you know that?
amir: Ok.
jake: Have you even gotten laid? You ever fucked, Blumenfeld? No, I didn't think so, did you? You're a piece of shit, right?
jake: You think you're a piece of shit? Just say you're a piece of shit.
amir: Owwww.
jake: Say it.
amir: I'm a piece of shit.
jake: Yeah.
amir: Just leave me alone!
jake: That's right.
amir: You know, you're not being very nice to me today.
jake: Yeah, fuck you.
amir: I mean, I appreciate that you're sitting next to me, eating lunch with me, but-
jake: Yeah right. I wouldn't eat lunch with you to save my mother's life.
jake: You know you're a fucking joke, man? Nobody respects you, why don't you name one person in this office that even likes you.
amir: I don't know, you?
jake: Wrong!
amir: Why don't you just get out of here and let me finish my lunch in peace?
amir: Come on! Look, this is all wet! Ugh, it's so soggy! Ugh, it's gross! Ugh, so soggy! It's so gross! What's your problem?
jake: Hey, Amir, one last thing.
amir: What?
jake: You failed. That's right, man. It was a test.
amir: What are you talking about?
jake: Can't let people talk to you like that, man. You gotta, you gotta stand up for yourself. Be strong.
amir: Ok. Thanks.
jake: Yeah.
amir: Uh, if you ever do another test, can you make sure it's not this way?
jake: Don't talk back to me!
amir: I'm so sorry.
jake: Alright, see ya.
amir: It's meant a lot to me.
jake: Yeah, whatever.
jake: I bet you I can go in there and barrade Amir, ruin his lunch, come back out, and he's gonna respect me more than he ever has.
jeff: Yeah, probably.
jake: Yeah.
Jake - Alright so you're gonna take 48 and uh... multiply that by 56

Jake - and then just add that to 93 times 12
Amir - hundred and six
jake - yeah
Jake turns to Amir and stage whispers
Jake - Way off
Jake is talking to his brother again

jake: I know, you're-- you're sitting across from me.
amir: What's going on for tonight?
jake: Nothing.
amir: You know I can barely hear you, I dunno if it's you or if it's me.
jake: It's definitely you. We're not on the phone, Amir.
amir: Ok. Lemme talk to you later.
jake: That's fine.
amir: Alright I'll talk to you later.
jake: Ok!
amir: Bye.
jake: What is your problem, and what is in your back?
amir: What?  Oh my God. Look at this! I walked to work,  there's still a hanger in my back. Ahah! I guess I never took it off of it when I wore it to work.
jake: C'mon, man.
amir: What?
jake: We talked about this. I will only talk to you if--
amir: If you don't feel pity, I know, I'm sorry.
jake: ...
amir: Jake, it's Amir. I feel really bad about before. I hope we can still be gullies, man.
jake: ...
amir:  Uh... Jake it's Amir again--
jake: Shut up!
amir: Hello?
jake: ...
amir: Labor Day.?
jake: Yup.?
amir: What did you do this long weekend?
?jake: Uh, went home, visited my family, you?
?amir: I went camping.?
jake: Sounds pretty fun, who'd you go with??
amir: I went-I went alone, I went by myself.
jake:  . . . Oh, you're serious.?
amir: Yeah.
?jake: Why would you do that?
?amir: Huh??
jake: Why would you go camping on your own?
?amir: I asked around, nobody really wanted to go, so . . .
?jake: So the normal reaction to that is just not to go, right??
amir: Live and learn, I guess.
jake: Where'd you go?
?amir: The Adirondacks.?
jake: God, that's like, 3 hours away.
?amir: Yeah, it's 350 miles north of here.
?jake: How did you get there?
?amir: I took a cab.?
jake: Jesus! Are you kidding me? How much was it?
?amir: Seventeen hundred dollars.?
jake: Oh my god, Amir! How do you have that kind of money to waste?
?amir: I don't. ?
jake: Jesus, you look really sick. ?
amir: I am, I know, I haven't eaten in three days. ?
jake: Yeah, you look really pale. Did you not bring food?
?amir: No. I mean I thought I'd catch a fish or something.
?jake: Are there even lakes up there?
?amir: No, that's the worst part. I had to like, follow squirrels and try to club them over the head with a fishing rod.?
jake: How did you get home?
?amir:  My leg!
?jake: You can't change the subject.?
amir: I took a cab.?
jake: . . . god.

amir: I thought of Halloween costumes for us.
jake: What?
amir: Blood brothers.
jake: Number one, Halloween is two months away. Two, we're not dressing the same, and three, blood brothers isn't a costume.
jake: Don't! I'm- What is that?
amir: Uh, this is just a key, but I'm ready to do it with a pin if you are.
jake: Alright, I'm not.
amir: Ok.
jake: Not even close.
amir: You're just saying that to impress your friends.
jake: What friends? What are you talking about?
amir: Any friend. Anything.
jake: Are you just, like, repeating stuff you heard on T.V. again?
amir: Why do I feel like I'm the only one working on this?
jake: Ok, so you are. I think I probably just shouldn't talk to you.
amir: Maybe you should.
jake: Ok, you're talking really strangely.
amir: Definitely.
jake: Ok, see, it's like, even that, it seems like it makes sense, but it doesn't.
amir: I guess I'm acting weird because I lost a brother today.
jake: You mean like a blood brother?
amir: Yeah.
jake: Ok, that doesn't count.
jake: Do it.
amir: No. It really hurt last time.
jake: Thought so.
jake: What the hell, man? What is it?
amir: Look at your desktop.
jake: Oh my god!
amir:  Oh, man.
jake: What is that?!
amir: It's an old fashioned prank, son. It's my parents having sex, and it's on your desktop.
jake: What?!
amir: I put a picture of my parents having sex, and now it's on your desktop.
jake: Hey that's not a prank on me, man.
amir: What?
jake: Sarah, look at this.
amir: What are you doing?
jake: It's Amir's parents having sex.
sarah: Your mom's not even enjoying it.
amir: Come on! Stop! This is a prank for you, not for her!
jake: You guys!
amir: Stookay, no.
jake: Hey!
amir: I don't want you to be embarrassed.
jake: I know! Oh my god.
amir: Come on.
jake: I should send this out.
sarah: Streeter!
amir: Don'tcome on! Stop it.
jake: Cassels, come here!
amir: No, don't come here! Please! I'm beJake, I'm begging you, please do not comeit's not! It's a joke, it's a prank! Please! What
are you doing?!
sarah:  Amir Blumenfeld.
jake: Amir's parents having sex.
amir: Come on, stop. It's just a prank for you!
sarah: Jeff, look!
amir: There's nothing to look at!
amir: Prank over. Okay? Everyone had their fun, right?
jake: Can you put my monitor back? Put it back up.
dan: What's going on?
amir: I wanna prank you, but you made me feel bad about it.
jake: You know, for your next prank, you should just like, piss your pants in public. That would really get me.
amir: You think so?
jake: That would be pretty good. Is there another picture on here?
amir: Don't open it!
jake: What are you doing?
amir: Why don't you pass the axe, bro? I'll show you how to really shred. Shred so hard.
amir: Give me the triangle plastic disc.
jake: The pick?
amir: The disc, yeah, the dick. Pick.
amir: Did you even, like, tune this axe? I taught myself how to play guitar.
jake: Ok.
amir: So. Pretty fly for a white guy.
jake: Yeah, but, that wasn't you playing. That was Will. You just cut to a close-up of Will playing.
amir: Nah.
jake: Why don't you just play that same exact thing except no close-up shots, just a plain old shot of you playing.
amir: Easy.
jake: Wanna take that disc and play?
amir: It's a pick.
amir: When I taught myself how to play guitar, uh, I knew two chords.
amir: Hold on a second.
jake: Just go up.
amir: Stop, stop. This... you messed it up.
jake: I messed it up?
amir: Yeah. And now...
jake: Now everybody knows, so I did mess it up.
amir: Honestly, when I came in here and you were playing guitar, I thought you were playing the electric guitar. This is the only guitar I know how to play.
amir: I'm sorry for confusing you, how many times to I have to apologize to you?
jake: You haven't apologized yet, but once is fine.
amir: I just, I'm starting to feel like crap around you, man. It's just, I don't know what I'm doing wrong.
jake: Nothing.
amir: Like, I got 15% on Free Bird the other day, I activated super power and just didn't mean it.
jake: Star power.
amir: I can't even talk around you anymore.
amir: Ever since, I don't know, ever since she came I just feel like crap.
jake: Who's she?
amir: My Playstation 3.
amir: I don't shred by taking things, like, easily, you know? Look at this.
jake: Yeah.
jake : Hello?
amir: Woah. Wow. Hello.
jake: What? Did you miss your flight?
amir: Uh, yeah. Actually, no. I was... I'm in the bathroom now.
jake: What?
amir: Sorry, lavatory. I mean, what's the difference, anyway? There's nothing a little notorious about this place.
jake: What the hell are you talking about?
amir: I mean, like, it looks like a bathroom, but they call it a lavatory. I just, I don't get it.
jake: No, I mean how are you on the phone?
amir: I don't know, I mean, I was lonely as hell, so I tried to see if this would work.
jake: Come on, don't say lonely. Say bored, remember?
amir: Ok, sorry.
jake: Alright, look, this is really dangerous, I'm just going to hang up.
amir: No, don't! I'm bored as shit!
jake: No, it's unsafe!
amir: Ok, fine. I'll call you when I land.
jake: Don't. Jesus.
amir: Hello?
rosie: Was that Amir?
jake: Yeah.
rosie: Is he in-flight?
jake: He is.
sarah: Um, Amir just texted me. 'What's Jake doing?'
jake: Oh my god.
jake:  What's up dude?
girl: Hey.
jake : Tickle me.   Ah man.
jake: See ya.
amir: What was that?
jake: What?
amir: What? Are you ticklish all of a sudden?
jake: What's the big deal?
amir: Nothing... I have to go to the bathroom. 
jake : Hey, you're back?  Wha- What the fuck is the matter with you?
amir: So you're not ticklish!
amir:  Do bald people have to like shampoo their scalp???
jake: No.??
amir: I guess it looks like one of those questions nobody will know the answer to.
??jake: Well, I just told you, so. ??
amir: It's a rhetorical question. ?
jake: It's not. ??

amir: Earth to Jake: get off the phone. It's so annoying.
jake: To the phone When?
amir: No personal calls before six, that's a rule, and the reason it's a rule is because it annoys people when you talk.
jake: To the phone Oh my god. Is he going to be okay?

amir: Seriously, if you're going to call your sister, go out, do it in the lunch room, on your cell phone-
jake: Please leave me alone right now. To the phone I love you call me if you hear anything else.
Jake hangs up the phone.
amir: Oh I'm sorry are you crying because I disciplined you? Well guess what Jake? This is the real world; there are rules and bosses discipline their employees if they break those rules, right?
jake: You're not my boss and just shut up, I may have lost my dad today.
amir: Okay, wow. I didn't realize you guys were so close. Come on man, let's go get fro-yo or something. Do you have five bucks? Do you have five bucks though because I don't think I have- I don't think I have it on me. I really think it will cheer you up.

amir: You see, what you don't get Jake is, when it comes to keep away the hand is quicker than the eye, Jeff!
amir: Ok, I quit, forget it then, I don't wanna play.
(Jake puts on headphones and starts rocking out to Girl All the Bad Guys Want. Amir notices, and starts to imitates him. When Amir puts
on headphones, Jake notices Amir.)
jake: What are you doing?
amir: What?
jake: What are you doing?
amir: Listening to DVDs.

amir:  Look, a taxi cab over there, it look like it's Britney Spears is driving it. It's all over the place.

amir: The programmer guys they...they stole my wallet.
jake: Oh, god. When?
amir: I don't know. Eight days ago.
jake: Jesus. How have you been eating?
amir: I haven't.
jake: What are you planning on doing when the thirty dollars is up?
amir: Easy. You go to delis with hot bars, and at the end of the day when they're about to throw them away you say you work for a shelter, they donate it to you, and then you just take-
jake: Ugh, never mind.
Jake gets up from his desk
amir: Thirty dollars, please!
jake: No!
Jake returns with Amir's wallet, hands it to Amir.
amir: Ah, thank you so much.
Amir opens wallet.
amir: Those pricks stole that picture of you.
Jake sits back at his desk
jake:  No actually, I took that back.
amir: Kay.
Amir puts his wallet back in his pocket.
amir: That's fair.
jake: Yeah. You know if you don't just stand up for yourself they're not going to stop walking all over you.
amir: Trust me, I can handle them, I just needed to-
Jeff walks over to Amir's desk
jeff: Hey, nice camera.  Nerd!
Amir lets out a groan.
Amir is sitting on Jake's lap.

jake: Yeah . . . do, do you know?
?amir: Oh, hmm, let's see Jake, uh...it couldn't possibly be plastic, so...?
jake: OK, I'm listening, you have my attention now.
?amir: Uh, it would be ridiculous to think that they take plastic and they melt it down to a thin layer. Oh that's in-that's insane, nobody could figure that out, who'd crack that mystery? H-how do they get the air in there? I don't know, do they...put it in?

amir: New computer huh?
jake: Yeah.
(Jake moves the new tall monitor so it blocks his line of sight to Amir. Amir cranes his neck sideways to see Jake; Jake moves the
monitor more.)
amir:  Ow.  Come on, this is ridiculous, I can't work like
this. I can't even see my screen!
jake: Can you just try to relax? What are you doing?
amir:  One second.
jake: Come on. Amir. Just try to work like a normal person. Please.
amir:  Did I tell you I found the sickest Halloween costumes for us brotha? Check it out. (Pointing to
himself) Corn and the cob.
jake: You mean corn on the cob.
amir: Is it?
jake: So you've, like, been chasing the same girl for three months?
patrick: Right, exactly.
jake: Yeah, and so this is what you got to do.
amir: 
patrick: 
jake: Oh god, that's digusting.
patrick: Epic.
jake: 
patrick: No, no, wait, wait. Finish what you were saying.
jake: Alright. What I'm saying is you have to plant a lot of seeds and see what grows, because there's no point in just having one girl on your radar.
amir: Exactly. Listen. It's called the Amir theory.
jake: Nope.
amir: You gotta have girls on your radar. You plant seeds, see what grows, right? Sometimes it's a tree, sometimes it's a leaf.
jake: Shut up, Amir.
patrick: No no, he's right. Sometimes it comes to fruition, and sometimes it doesn't.
jake: No, you don't understand. He never really knows what he's talking about.
amir: You guys are talking about frenching.
jake: No, we're-

(A surreal montage commences, showing Amir doing various things while stoned, with Gimme More playing. It ends with a large whiteboard
falling on Amir, crushing him and sending blood spraying. A D.A.R.E. logo is beside the blood. It transitions to Amir sitting at Jake's
desk telling the story to Jake.)
amir: No! and SBFFF! My head just explodes, so sick.
jake: It's really sick. It's just incredibly morbid. Don't think about anti-drug commercials at work, okay, just do your real actual
work.
amir:  You're fired.
amir:  -ther round, people, wherever you roam, and admit that the waters around you have grown, and accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone, if the time to you is worth sav--  --or you'll sink like a stone, and the times they are amazing.

jake: So you do know Jude is in there.

amir: God bless you.  I'm the only one? I'm the only one that will say god bless you.
sarah: I said god bless you.

jeff: Jesus, dude, come on!

amir: What was that about?
jake: Uh, this girl, that I'm kind of interested in, but we've been friends for a really long time-
amir:  Honestly, I'm not even listening. That's how little I give a shit.
jake: I open up like an inch, and you just-
amir: Alright, want some real advice?
jake: Sure.
amir: This is what you do. It might come off as a little disgusting, or whatever-
jake: Ok, then don't say it.
amir: Ok, eat her pussy.
jake: Oh, god, wish you didn't say that. Now I'm thinking about it.
amir: Jakes.
jake: I'm right here. We're having a conversation. Don't say my name in the middle of a conversation.
amir: Yeah.
jake: Ok. Yeah. We have a meeting to go to. Come on.
amir: Not going to that meeting, partner.
jake: Why?
amir: I'm supposed to refresh the homepage over and over, and if it breaks, tell one of the programmers about it, so...
jake: So, yeah, they had me do that like my first day as an intern, they told me I was way overqualified.
amir: Yeah, well, I guess they think I'm perfectly qualified for it then, so...
jake: You know, it's not even worth insulting you because you just don't get it.
amir: Jake.
jake: Woah. I know that look. Means you're about to do something crazy!
jake: Oh-hoh no! Yes! No way! I'm gonna hug you. I'm gonna hug you! I'm gonna hug you, here we go!  You're my boy. You're my
boy.

Oogh! So.  Ahh. Let's do a thing where we walk on one leg for the rest of the week. Pretty chill.
jake: Why don't you just sit back at your desk.
amir: I will.  Ahh, actually... Oo, is it hot in here, cause my ankle is swollen. Ahhh. You're my boy, you're
my boy. You're my boy.
jake: What?
amir: Oogh. Take off my shoe. 
jake: You hurt yourself? Did you hurt your ankle?
amir: No. Just take off my shoe, my ankle needs to breathe. 
jake: So you didn't hurt your foot, right?
amir: No I did not, just please take
jake: So if I go right here
amir: AAAAHHHH!
jake: Jesus, I have 98 emails from facebook.
amir: Really? That's weird
jake: Did you send me 98 facebook gifts?
amir: 99 brother
jake: Oh my god, these are a dollar each. You know that?
amir: Yeeeesss
jake: How do you have that kind of money?
amir: dad's cc 
jake: And he's okay with you doing this?
amir: He thinks they are for a gift for my girlfriend
jake: You don't have a girlfriend
amir: According to Jim I do
jake: Do you think that's a pun? God man, this is ridiculous
jake: I just don't understand. What are you doing? Let go of my foot.
jake: Amir what are you doing?
amir: Er, what size are you?
jake: I'll tell you what size I am, just stop
jake: Stop it. Stop it right now. Stop it.
jake: Give it back now. Right now. Right the fuck now.
maria: Speaking of fun trips, "The 9" team visited the offices of CollegeHumor, and were instantly charmed by the lovable and polite staff.
amir: Yellow, yellow, red, no, no, no, no, you're wrong, you're wrong--
streeter: Shut up, SHUT UP!

maria:  I'm trying to give him an award--
amir: Where's? Ok. Where's my award, then? So we'll both get one.
maria:  Here you go. Congratulations.
jake:  You don't get one.
amir: What? Then why'd you even invite me here? 
maria:  We didn't invite you here.
amir:  Ok, so you lied to me, then.
jake: No, you read my email.
maria:  Ok. Security!
amir: Ok? This is messed up, man.

amir: New Year's resolutions, shoot!
jake: No.
amir: K, mmm, mine's for you to be nicer to me.
jake: Not a resolution.  That's not how they work.
amir: K.  I have another one.  But-
jake: What is it?
amir: Stupid, so stupid, heh. It's for me to be more confident, or not, whatever.
jake: How's that working out for you?
amir: S-I should just do my original resolution, and that's it.
jake: What's that?
amir: To lose weight.  That's pretty normal.  I saw a commercial for that.
jake: How much do you weigh?
amir: One-twelve.
jake: Ohh.
amir: With shoes!
jake: You're on the cusp of being grossly underweight.
amir:  What's average? ish?
jake: I don't know, like, one sixty.

jake: No what?
amir: Close, but no sid-cider.
jake: Spell it.
amir: Swy D R.
jake: You know, you never cease to impress me-
jake: -and not in a good way, how dumb you are.
amir: You wonder why I don't have any confidence, or whatev-
jake: What did you say, idiot?
amir: Nothing.
amir: Jake.
 Sorry, everyone, can't find this video.  Could put the youtube one but I'm sure someone can add this.
jake: No, I mean, I think that's all doable, and I actually don't even see the need to bring--
amir:  Yeah, I don't see the need to--I'm sorry, Jake is at work right now, so he'll have to call you later.
jake:  Sorry... God...
amir: First of all, don't get on the phone at work, I've already told you that before, I don't want to see you get in trouble,  I'm sorry. Second of all,  winter break is the bomb, all day long, sittin' under the palm.
jake:  I was on the phone about work, oh my god!
amir: ...FUCK a cheerleader twice, eat her pom-poms!
jake:  kidding me.
amir: Oh! Oh I'm sorry, so this is about work then. Yeah these are your notes about work. So refine editorial calendar is about work, talk to Amir about demotion or, oh Valentine's Day pics! I guess that's about work too?
jake: Yeah.
amir: Yeah. *phww* 
jake: What're you-- what exactly are you trying to do?
amir: I'm trying to throw it in the air like it doesn't mean shit to me.
jake: Just straight up over your head I guess, then.
amir: I don't wanna bend it, these are still your notes.
jake: It's fine.
amir:  Bowm!

jake: So movies twice, then?
amir: Second time was spelled differently.
jake: Then you spelled it wrong.
amir: Okay.. aah.. I write a freestyle, and it doesn't mean anything--
jake: Freestyle means it's off the top of your head.
amir: Okay.  Every time I make it better, harder stronger faster better--
jake: That's Kanye West.
amir: It's called sampling.
jake: It's not. And you said it wrong.
amir: Ok. I can't say it right, cuz then it's illegal.
jake:  Can you just go back to work? I need to be on the--
amir: Yeup!

(Amir is holding the camera. Just around the corner, Jake is filling his arms with telephones. Suddenly, Amir comes out and
surprises Jake, making him drop the telephones.)
amir: Woo!
jake: God!
amir: Oo, my lord, it's time for the Astronaut Accountants featuring Ace and Jocelyn!
jake: What the fuck are you doing?
amir: Basically, we're two astronaut accountants from outer space. You're Ace, good-looking ladies guy
jake: I don't care
amir: and I'm Jocelyn, your sort of sidekick, a little more cute, but I still get pussy, but not as much as you because I
don't look as good in jeans. And basic
jake: Will you help me pick these up? Please?
amir:  Oh my gosh! What a find! What are these weird plastic rods? Who am I supposed to call with
them? I have no idea I'm fr
jake: So you know they're for calling people, but you don'tbut you think they're foreign rods. But they're for calling people
definitely. Right?
amir: Stick to the script, brotha. Let's cut. Let's
jake: What script?
amir: I emailed you a script.
jake: When?
amir: Right before I got here, like 10 seconds ago.
jake: Oh my god, Amir, whawhat do I say to that? You know that that's stupid, right?
amir: They can't go anywhere without being together, not even the bathroom.
jake:  I can hear you, and you better not fucking tape me, Amir.
amir:  What's that, Ace?
jake: Oh my
amir: Oh my!
(Jake is sitting at his desk talking on his phone. His words have been edited and pieced together to make him say the
following line.)
jake: Until next time, you're my best friend, Jocelyn.
amir: You're my best too, Ace.
jake:  Hey, what's up dude? You here? Nice. Alright, I'll come right down. See ya. 
amir: What the hell are you doing, man?
jake: I'm just going to pick up my friend from high school, give him a little tour.
amir: Ha ha yeah. You don't see me hanging out with like friends high school giving tours for fun. Right?
jake: You don't have any friends.
amir: Don't need friends, I have you. You bring your friend up here, I'm gonna beat the shit out of him. That's a guarantee, alright?
jake: Just try to be polite, please? We're not gonna be here long, alright.
amir: Yeah, I'll be polite. I'll be polite when I kick his ass OUTTA here! He's done dude!
jake:  Chill out!
amir: You're welcome Jake. Whatever.

josh: What's up with your friend, Jake?

jake: Everything. I don't know where to start, I guess.
amir: I like this guy, you know? I really do.
jake: You like this guy. Cause...
amir: Yeah. Yeah.
jake: Cause a minute ago you said you were gonna kick his ass.
josh: What?!
amir: Pff...
jake: Yeah, you know what, you guaranteed it actually.
amir: What?
jake: You guaranteed you were gonna beat the shit out of him.
amir: No... I think I was talking about your other friend.
amir: Nngh! Jake! Awgh... Good luck getting into a phat party without me, you guys.
amir: AAAHHH!
Jake and Amir are sitting at their desks. When Amir starts singing. Jake gets annoyed and grabs a bottle of drugs, opens the cap, and pours some into his hand.
amir:  I'm so excited/And I just can't hide it/ I know, I know, I know, I know, I - what are you doing? What is that?
jake: Taking some ibuprofen.
amir: Ibuprofeen? Yeah right.
Amir gets out of his chair and rushes over to Jake's desk.
jake: Would you just relax?
Amir grabs the bottle and looks at it.
jake: Jesus Christ!
amir: What is this, man?
Amir takes the bottle and pours the pills into a garbage can by Jake's desk.
jake: Oh my god. 
amir: Come on, man!
Amir hugs Jake tightly. Jake looks squished and annoyed. Amir speaks directly into Jake's ear.
amir: Come on, man. Ah, I'm not going to fucking lose - this is going to be okay. This is going to be okay.
jake: I'm not pissed; you just owe me ten bucks okay?
amir: Do you feel me breathing? 
jake: No.
amir: Regulate your breathing like mine. 
jake: Stop it! Let go!
amir: Come on, man! This - Aw, I know you fucking hate me right now-
jake: I always hate you right now.
amir: Aw, but it's so worth it to me. This is so fucking what I-
jake: Obviously. Just get off of me!
amir: I will not let you go because you mean WAY too much to me to let go!
jake: People can probably hear you, alright?
amir: I don't care. I don't FUCKING CARE!
Jake begins slapping Amir's head with his left hand. Amir yells and lets go.
amir: Aw, goddamn-!
Cut to black, the cut to Jake and Amir sitting in chairs facing the camera. They talk directly to the audience.
jake: Hi, I'm Jake.
amir: And I'm Jake.
jake: He's Amir. What you saw just now was a Jake and Amir skit.
amir: Hilarious Jake and Amir video.
jake: That's an opinion.
amir: Basically, what we're trying to say is ibuprofen in no joke.
jake: Okay, so you didn't get it then.
amir: Two to three a day is enough to kill a baby elephant.
jake: I mean it's not.
amir: Okay, if he chokes on the bottle-
jake: It's different. I'm stopping it.
amir: Don't. You have a right to know-!
(Jake and Amir are in a conference room. Amir runs out, and returns an indefinite amount of time later, still putting on a shirt
identical to Jake's.)
jake: So you left to get the same shirt as me?
amir: Can't prove that. Let's eat.
jake: Can we just try to get some work done before we do that, please?

sarah: Hey. Come on, let's do something fun, let's, um... go to Six Flags, like we wanted to.
amir: Oh sheesh, amusement park, I am there brotha.
jake: I'm not your fucking brotha, and you're not invited.
amir: Why not?
jake: Okay, number one you hate roller coasters.
amir: Okay, number one most of it is waiting in lines, which I love to do. Next.
jake: Okay then, number two that's sad, and number three, every time everybody's hanging out together and having fun, you seem to ruin
it.
amir: What? What are you talking about?
jake: Oh, I don't know, why don't we start with: earlier today when we were all sitting on the beanbag?
(Dan, Streeter, and Sarah are on the beanbag, and Jake and Pat are beside it. Amir is sitting at his desk, which is nearby. They talk
over each other, so not all of the dialogue could be transcribed.)
sarah: That's not true either, maybe you said fat girls.
dan: But thenbut then how do you define doggy style? Like, when a girl's just totally flat on her stomach, is that still doggy style?
Or is that...
sarah: Yeah that countslike, with the legs together?
dan: Legs together.
st: No way! No!
sarah: Yeah! Why does that not count? It'sit's from behind 
st: Cause it's a whole different motion!
amir: Guys, listen. You guys are talking about butch league stuff.
jake: Butch league...
amir: This is what you do: suspend the girl. Two hooks, through the meat of her back. One in the base of her spine. Two through her
shoulderblades. You suspend her towards the roof, counterclockwise. She falls to you clockwise, and you're supine on a raised platform;
when you guys meet, it goes into her like a screwdriver.
dan: , man.
st: Dude!
sarah: Nope.
amir: You have to break her legs to get in the hole.
dan: Fuck.
amir:  Let the bodies hit the floor. Let the bodies hit the floor. Let the bodies hit theFLOOOOORRRR!
(A third flashback commences. A pushup contest is happening, again near Amir's desk. Three people, including Jake, are doing pushups,
and five people are cheering. Amir runs towards the group.)
amir: Cannonbaaaaall!
amir: Wow. You are still pissed about that, aren't you.
amir: Sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry! Did anybody notice that I was late?
jake: Nope, nobody noticed because nobody's here.
amir: Okay, so no. Perfecto.
jake: Everybody noticed that you weren't at work today, though.
amir: But nobody noticed that I was nay late?
jake: Nope, I guess not, just me, who's here at 11 doing your work for you.
amir: Okay, please don't turn this into a thing.
jake: I mean... how do you even be 13 hours late to work?
amir: Um... I guess I set my alarm for 8 and I snoozed. I snoozed it until seven chirty , and then I raced here as fast as I
could.
jake: Okay, well given the fact that that's sad on its own... why did it take you three and a half hours to get to work?
amir:  Pit stop!
jake: Nice! Is your computer in that bag?
amir: Ah, sheesh, no. But, there is a third-pounder here with your name on it, brotha.
jake: That's disgusting, please put it away.
amir: Okay.
jake: I mean, why are you even here? What are you doing here?
amir: Um... I was gonna save that for your 18th birthday, b

jake: Seriously though.
amir: 'j' 'a' 'k' 'k' 'e'. Okay yeah. Must have been a fingor  slip. When I

amir: Uh, yeah. Iokay. Jake with one 'k'. Now I know that. Going forward.
jake: Okay, how 'bout the dot org. Why is that?
amir: Um... I think dot com was taken.
jake: Probably not.
amir: Yeah. I don't know. Well, I mean, why are you critiquing it? Look, it's pretty much the chillest site devoted to us.
jake: I guess I just don't understand why anybody in their right mind would go to a website about us. Just seems really boring.
jake: Hey guys!
?: Hey Jake.
sarah: Hi!
jake: What are you doing?
?: We're gonna get dinner, wanna come?
jake: Yes, but I don't have any cash.
sarah: Oh, that's ok. We can stop by an ATM or something.
jake: That's really far away, actually. I have an idea. Dinner's gonna be on me, hold on.
sarah: Nice.
jake: What's up, dude?
amir: Counting DVDs, yes sir.
jake: What number were you at?
amir: Whatever three after nine is. What was that?
jake: Don't bother. It's my move. Can't use it.
amir: I'm interested. In. Buying it.
jake:  Whispering is when you talk lower near my ear, ok? Anyway, it's not for sale, sorry.
amir: Everything is for sale, brotha. What say you to twenty?
jake: Don't make me laugh. See you tommorow. 
amir: Wait wait wait wait wait! Forty.
jake: Sixty.
amir: Eighty.
jake: Done for eighty.
amir: I only have five twenties.
jake: Cool. I'll do it for a hundred. No refunds.
amir: I stopped listening to you after you said I had a nice hairdo.
jake: Then you never started listening.
amir: 
amir: 
guy: What the fuck are you doing?
amir:  I know, it's so stupid. I was making fun of some homo who I saw on the subway. Quick question. Does anyone have a hundred bucks I can borrow?
guy 2: Why don't you hope to an ATM and get it?
amir:  Yeah, right. I'll see y'all later.  Jake!
*I have no idea what the name of Guy, Guy 2, or ? are. Any help?
Amir  Jake! Uh, going to the bathroom?
jake: Actually, I'm glad you're here. Check this.  My name's Amir, and I'm a loser.
amir:  I like this beat.
jake: And no one likes me.
amir: Whooh! Except for most people.
jake: And I will never steal Jake's wallet again.
amir: I like the beginning of that song, but I can nay promise the end of it.
jake: You should be able to.
amir: I'll see you tomorrow.
jake: You won't. I'm going to Florida.
amir: As am I.
jake: Oh, really? Because last time I checked, I was going to Florida with my friends, and you're not my friend.
amir: Last time I checked, you were going with your friends, your cousin Diana, and your cousin Diana's date; me, Amir. Blumenfeld. Blumenfeld is my- Blumenfeld is my last name, FYE.
jake: FYE?
amir: For your advice.
jake: Ok, so, wrong phrase, wrong word, and it wouldn't start with an E.
amir: You know, if you're gonna keep this up, I don't even think I should go to Florida.
jake: That'd be awesome.
amir:  We're even.
jake: We're far from even.
amir:  Mph, I don't want to have to do that again.
 Screen says: TO BE CONTINUED
amir : Pick your poison! 
jake: You're 25, you really need to start eating like an adult.
amir: I just, if I ate any more than three my stomach would start to hurt.
jake: Ok, not what I meant.
amir: Can I ask you a personal question?
jake: No.
amir: I don't think we should go to Florida.
jake: Not personal, not a question, and I said no, so...
amir: It's just, if we're going for the sandwiches, my uncle owns a deli and he can hook us up royal if we stay in New York.
jake: Alright, what are you talking about?
amir: My cousin works for a Subway.
jake: So just say that. We're not going for the sandwiches, we're going for the beach.
amir: That's true. I just, truth is I'm afraid of flying. I've never been on an airplane before.
jake: Just relax, it's going to be fine.
amir: You're right. We can get through this together. 
jake : You can get through this alone.
amir:  Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god-
jake: Just relax. We're in the air. There's nothing you can do.
amir: There's always something you can do.
jake: Don't.
amir:  There's a fucking bomb on the plane, everybody hit the fucking floor now!
amir : We should just take a train, man.
jake: We already bought stand-by tickets for the next flight.
amir: Trust me, a train will be faster. I can do that like ten more times.
girl: Oh hey, do you want to put this one there?
amir: Yeah.  I don't know how puzzles work.
jake: Amir. Can I talk to you in the kitchen, please?
amir: Yeah.
jake: QQ, ass-fuck. What time did I tell you to wake me up?
amir: 12:30?
jake: 11:30. What time is it now?
amir: 5:30.
jake:  It's 6:30.
amir: Yikes!
jake: Look at me.
amir: You got some color.
jake: Yeah, red. I'm burnt to a crisp!
jake: Ow!
amir: Well, I mean red is technically a color. Besides, this might be one of those good problems to have.
jake: Not knowing what supermodel to date would be a good problem to have. This sucks!
amir: I'm listening.
jake: That's it. I'm done talking. You've single-handedly ruined my vacation on the first day we're here.
amir: You know, Diana told me to stick up for myself against you.
jake: What is that supposed to mea--
jake: OW! Fuck you. I'm done talking to you.
jake: OW! God damn it! What is wrong with you?! I fucking hate you!

amir: No way, no way, Jurassic Prak 2 was so underrated.
jake: How can you say that, Jurassic Park 2 was terrible.
amir: Not true, Jeff Goldblum was in it, which is great. And the special effects were phenomenal for the time.
jake: Special effects? Name one good special effect in that movie.

I'm an idiot. Amir Blumenfeld is an idiot.
jake: OK wow. Uh, I see what's going on, Patrick, why would you agree to this?
amir: Amir said he'd pay me $1453. No, I didn't I said $1553.

amir: C. H. Patrick has logged off.
jake: Come on.
Jake is sitting at table. Amir comes in with a bag over his head shrieking.
jake: Jesus Christ!
Amir takes the bag off of his head.
amir:  I'm just kidding. Not that you'd even care if I tried to kill me. Would you?
jake: No.
amir: Okay. Let's start from the ze-top. Filling out our men's basketball bracket. I'll start. Division I Men's Bracket Opening Round Game vs. March 18th. Who ya got?
jake: Let's start lower with an actual team. North Carolina vs. Mount St. Mary.
amir: 16 - 1 already. So, once you're up 20, there's no going back. I'd be a fool to go for North Carolina in this situation. M T S T Mary, thank you.
jake: Okay, you can't do math. Also, this isn't a scoreboard. These are their seeds.
amir: Okay. Not gonna change my pick.
jake: You are though. I'm watching you.
amir:  Don't cheat.
amir: What'd you get for Indiana?
jake: I just wrote Indiana.
amir: Me too. 
jake: No, you're drawing a picture of me.
amir: How can you tell?
jake: Because the hair's.
amir: Because the pearly white teeth.
jake: Stop.
amir: Moving on. By U vs. Texas A  and M. So it's two teams against one, it would be a sucker's bet to go for anybody but these Texas teams.
jake: You know you're an idiot, but I got Texas AM too, so.
amir: Texas A or M? Okay, you can't  have them both, okay. So, I'll take Baylor and Perda over Zav-. How do you - when a word starts with an x, what is that?
amir: You smell super good today by the way bro.
jake: C'mon.
amir: What?!
jake: That.
amir: St. Mary's and then also Mount St. Mary's. So, this bracket's already busted, right? So. Let me tear it and we'll start it from there. 
jake: Ok, Those - there are two St. Mary's teams.
amir: Okay, that's fine. I'll just tape it back together. It's not the first time I made that mistake.
jake: You can tell.
amir: What. Barely.
amir: Oral Roberts  What is that - Is that team about having butt sex with each other?
jake: That's immature and the wrong innuendo.
amir: Baylor, straight to da final tree.
jake: It's final four.
amir: Not when you're that good. From way downtown.  Ah sheesh, can I borrow your pen?
Amir is circling something.
amir: From way downtown. 
jake: C'mon.
Amir is now holding a pink highlighter.
amir: We should write a movie about two guys that predict scores.
jake: It's already a movie.
amir: Texas versus Austin P. Ooo I like Austin P.  in the final four baby, yeah!
jake: It's not very likely.
amir:  Oh does that prediction make you horny?
jake: It makes me sad.
amir: Same th- Same thing.
jake: Do you even have the $5 buy in?
amir: Um, nay. But, I have a feeling Mr. Hamilton  will persuade the bracket masta.
Jake takes $5 bill from Amir and throws it on the table. Amir quickly snatches it back.
amir: Lightning round! UCLA! 
jake: You're just drawing lightning.
amir: Or whatever.
jake: Not or whatever. You are.
amir: San Diego. 
jake: Write it!
amir: That's a chill bolt.
Amir is laughing hysterically.
amir: Oral Roberts.
amir: Alright, this is taking way too long.  We got dinner to go to.
jake: We don't.
amir: Finals. San Antonio vs. who?
jake: The finals are in San Antonio. You need to pick two teams.
amir: Alright. 
jake: It's Jake. Jake wins it all.
amir: Sorry. I thought that's where we put our name.
jake: It's my name.
amir: It's our name.
Jake gets up from his chair.

jake: Okay here you go, question one.  How often do you eat vegetables?
amir: Ten times a day.
sarah: Really?  Good job.
jake: You don't eat vegetables ten times a day.
amir: Oh, I thought you said how much do you eat every day and that Vegetables was your nickname for me.
sarah: 
jake: No, he's being serious.  How much fruit do you eat?
amir: Well is barbeque sauce a fruit, cause it's red and...
sarah: No...
amir: What, er...
jake: Kay, she's being polite.  She meant to say, "Of course it's not, obviously, you fucking retard."
amir: Alright, what about fries?  Er, that's a potato, er, er apples?  Or ketchup!
sarah: Well apples, apples are a fruit.
amir:  Eh, okay.  Still zero then.
jake: Okay, I'll skip this question about vitamins because I assume you don't know what those are.
amir: Thank you soul mate.
sarah: Alright, uh, how many times do you eat fast food in a week?
amir: ...Sparingly.
sarah: Oh, that's great!
jake: No, watch this.  Amir, what does "sparingly" mean?
amir: All day, every day, every hour, got a chicken nugget in my pocket gotta put it in my mouth.
sarah: Jesus, where did that, where did that even come from?
jake: He just has them.
amir: Hey, anyway, what's it say?  How long do I got?  Sixty years?  Two hundred years?
jake: Stop.
amir: Three hundred years?

amir: Living on borrowed time.  Pretty chill, pretty poetic.
sarah: Yeah, no, you should watch what you eat, Amir.
amir: I do watch.  I watch it go...in my mouth!
jake: See, you don't even do that.
amir: Whateva.
jake: Will you at least pick that up?
amir: Five minute rule.
jake: Wow.
amir: What? It's like 4:30.
jake: No, that's not it, you're always like seven hours late.
amir: Consistent.
jake: I'm surprised you're not fired.
amir: Why would I be fired?
jake: Do you not remember yesterday?

amir:  Jake, by the way, you know how much I hate exercising but we are running  out of toilet paper. Just looking out for your best interest.  Best roommate ever! 
Any Hootie and the Blowfish, talked to the two dike-o's across the hall, may want to make nice with them, they did not appreciate me calling them lesbos to their face. Also, we are running, not dangerously low, but pretty low on nuugs, so you'll want to get that taken care of too.
?What else? Uh, right, mattresses. Cancelled your queenie because it was nay bunkable and that's sort of the deal breaker for me; got us two twinsies instead.  What are your thoughts of race-car beds, I hope positive, because  I already bought them. ?
what else? wi-fi situation: what does that mean? It seems really important and a lot of people are talking about it. We should probably get on that, ASAP.?
what else, what else, what else, what else . . . oh! if you're wondering how strong the mirror is in the bathroom: not stronger than my elbow, not strong than my elbow, hoo!  You don't care. ?Oh my god, no more of those, let's celebrate. I'm going to get more. ?

jake: Jesus. You know what actually, why I don't I just... I'll play these out loud.
amir: Noooo... haha, don't.
jake: Maybe this will teach you a lesson.
alex : Jake. LOL have you ever forgotten to wipe after pooping?
Anyway.
Stupid.
I learned how to French kiss this weekend.
Man.
Ouch.
Jake.
QQ, Do you know how magic works? I think my cousin is a wizard.
Straight up.
Jake.
Jake.
Jake.
Jake.
I'm bored.
Jake.
Jake.
I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 50 Jake.
Dinner tonight?
Oh my god I just found out something crazy, if you want to know what it is call me.
Jake.
Jake.
Oops wrong IM.
I'll pay you twenty dollars to tickle me right now.
Fifty dollars.
A hundred dollars.
Are you getting these messages?
Twenty dollars.
Eight dollars.
Jake.
LOL I lost all of my money betting on last week's episode of Lost.
Jake.
Jake.
How illegal is it to sleep in a public park?
Did you think about that tickle thing?
You know it hurts, shattering your elbow trying to break into a car.
Funny story.
Stop.
Stop this.
This is not happening.
Jesus.
I have to get out of here.
If you need me I'll be in your apartment.
rosie: He has keys to your apartment?
jake: Maybe, I honestly don't know.
alex : Also, Jake, before you come back, knock on the door, I may be naked.
Also, P.S. That number I was thinking of was infinity.
Were you close? I bet you were.
P.P.S. P.M.S. L.O.L.
amir : Uh yes, he's very excited to see you too.  Yeah, he'll be right downstairs. Okay, he'll see you soon, bye.
amir: Uhhh...I have to go...away...uh, cover for me for now.
jake: Cover for you?
amir : Thank you.
jake: Do you want me to be the one to play Snood all day? Why don't I stop working? Right? It'll be just like you're here.
amir: Mallory!
mallory: Yes?
amir: Jake's ex-girlfriend?
mallory: Yeah, is he here?
amir: No, I said that as a joke to get you over here.
mallory: So...Jake's not coming?
amir: No, Jake's not coming. I was kidding. He doesn't still love you. Get over it.
mallory: There's been a misunderstanding. I need to leave.
amir: Wait! You know Jake better than anyone else in the world other than me. What does one have to do to become better friends with him knowing full well that we're already best friends?
mallory: If you let me leave, I'll tell you.
amir: Interesting...
mallory: Well, Jake always wants what he can't have, so if you act really cold and really disinterested, he'll come to you.
amir : Whew, Is it cold? And distant in here, right?
jake: Nope.
amir: No dinner tonight. By the way, no dinner tonight.
jake: What?
amir: I don't want to eat dinner with you tonight.
jake: You don't want to eat dinner with me tonight?
amir: No...
jake: Not even if I go to McDonald's?
amir: Ergh! The D -- Definitely not interested.
jake: Okay...
amir: Thanks...
jake: ...Fair enough.
amir : But no thanks.
jake: You don't want to get dinner? Maybe you want to go away with me this weekend? Going to Boston...chicken nugget festival.
amir: Auuughh! Why? Why would I want to do do that? Why would I want to go to a chicken nugget festival with you? That sounds terrible.
jake: That's fine. We're just going to be eating french fries all day. And you know what? We're not going to be reading any books the entire weekend.
amir : Alright I'll fucking go!
amir:  Or whatever.
jake: I'm not going to make a scene, just leave.
amir: I'm leaving right now.  Lets just shop together for a few hours. Wow!
amir:  Jake. Gay.
amir:  Gay. Gay.
jake: It's all the same women's sweater.
amir: You have to think about what it would look like if both of us were wearing one.
jake: No I don't.
amir:  Whatever.
jake: Get off of me. It's $350 anyway I can't afford it.
amir: So that's $900 for both of us. Let do it.
jake: Not quite.
amir: Security is going to be, pretty pissed.
jake: Why?
amir:  Oh I dunno.
jake:  That's mine.
amir: Yes. But.
jake: How can you afford $900 for a jacket when I can't?
amir: I dunno Jake, it's called calling your Dad and telling him your girlfriend is in the hospital so you have to send her a gift. I mean, you're 23 years old...
jake: 22
amir:  ...figure it out.
amir: You owe me dinner!

woman: I love funny guys.
amir:  He's so nice and funny. Uh, today-- it's stupid, I'll oer--
woman: No! Tell me, tell me. Omigod.  Yeah.
amir:  Today, we were looking at your Facebook profile on his computer,

amir: ...and he was humping the monitor and high fiveing people and cracking up 
woman:  Really, that sounds so funny.
amir:  You think so?

jake: Eheheh It's like whoa!
amir: Yeah it's like you're pouring a highlighter marker down the toilet.
jake: Exactly. And to-- instead of washing my hands, I just peeled the skin off of my palm , and I just rinsed it out under the faucet, and I slid it back on like a glove.
amir: Yep. Like.. you slide it on like a glove, right? I was gonna say that.
jake: You did say that, right after I did. Tell me something crazy that happens to you.
amir: Uhhhh
jake: Talking about me, so

jake: We're not!
amir: Just go back to sleep, please.
jake: He's not going to go- This is his job, he doesn't sleep.
amir: Why are you trying to embarrass me?
jake: He can hear me through your hand . . . We're stuck in the elevator--
amir: No, we're not!
amir: You know it wouldn't surprise me if we were in here for the next three weeks.
jake: That would surprise me a lot, actually.
amir: We should play a car game to pass the time. Let's look for out of state license plates. . . . ow.
amir: Is your G-chat going slow? Mine's not working.
jake: What are you talking about?
amir: You said that earlier today.
amir: God, this is like that guy who was stuck in the elevator for 40 hours, only hopefully longer . . . what are you looking at?
amir: Guys, we should all get tattoos of this experience so we don't forget it, I'll get the elevator, you get this homo.
jake:  Oh, dude, come on.
amir: Rations!
guy: It-It's empty.
amir:  I was hungry. Sorry. Somebody's not getting to lick the bag.
jake: What are you doing?!
amir: I have to go! It's been like, forever!
jake: It's been three minutes.
amir: It's just starting to dawn on me that we might not make it out of here alive.

jake:  Yeah.
amir: Pick it up!
THE END.

amir: Jake.  Q-Q quick question. I hope you don't mind that I mention that.
jake: Mention that what?
amir: I don't know, you usually, like, cut me off or tell me to shut up after two lines so I don't plan my freestyles that long.
jake: Yeah, you don't plan freestyles.
amir: Yes. I. Do. What, you want me to come up with it off the top of my head?
jake: No.
amir: You know, I think we talk to each other too much.
jake: Yeah. I agree.
amir: Which is why, I've been working, like you told me to, on a secret code language that we can use. You know, just between us. That way we can talk to each other faster but just as much.
jake: Right, right. I told you to work on the vide-
amir: Anyway, let's get started. L-G-S is let's get started so if I say that, that's what I mean.
jake: Alright, so you sat down, you got to work, and you just, you thought of just taking the first letter-
amir: And it just took me ten Ms, relax.
jake: Even taking ten minutes to do that, though, is kinda pathetic.
amir: Oh, no no no.  M means day. So, it's, a little bit more convoluted than you thought.
jake: Yeah, oh my God.
amir: You mean O-M-R.
jake: No, I don't.
amir: Jake.
jake: Don't.
amir: Yeah, you're right. I shouldn't change your name, it's perfect.
jake: Ew.
amir: D-T?
jake: Dinner tonight?
amir: Yes. Yes!
jake: Ok, no. You know I wasn't. I would never ask you to dinner.
amir:  Too late, you promised, I'll meet you there. Ah!

jake:Did any of them fall out as a result of how tightly they were packed?
amir: Yea exactly two
jake: Two. okay so it sounds like the same answer. Seven

Anyway, uh, a lot of you guys have been complaining that there's not a lot of super villains in these episodes, which is a great complaint, which is why, today, Ace and I are gonna foil the plot of an evil scientist who's ugly and-
pat: No, you never said that I was gonna be ugly.
amir: What? Argh, what are you...?
amir: In this episode, Ace is gonna be confronted by an evil, hideous scientist who can't handle a camera or keep his mouth shut for the life of-
pat: Alright, I'm leaving.

amir: I'm really sorry. I mean-
pat: I'm sorry, too. I don't understand why you're-
amir: I know. This is... I'm... this is probably so weird for someone like you, who has this, like-

amir: Ace.
pat: Ah!
jake: I'm so sorry.
amir: The astronaut accountants strike again!
jake: This is... Amir, is this... is this that stupid pilot thing that you're doing?
pat: Guys-
amir: Let me-
pat: ... I think I'm blind! Guys, I think I'm blind.
amir: Justice.
jake: Hey, guess what? You're a double agent.
amir: What?
pat: Guys, I think I'm blind.
jake: You're a double... you're a double agent, Ace-
amir: No way.
jake: ... or Jocelyn, or whatever the fuck your name is.
amir: I would never-
pat: Jake, take the cell phone out of my pocket.
amir: Ace, get the cell phone out. Don't, yet. This is so messed up, right now.
jake: This, this right here, this is a finger-blasting gun and it shoots invisible lasers and I'm gonna shoot you.
pat: Guys, I think I'm blind.
amir: I know WHAT IT IS! JUST RELAX, ACE, PUT IT DOWN!
pat: I already know the insurance.
jake: Get on your knees, right now. Get on your knees.
amir: This isn't supposed to happen, not until season two.
jake: You have ten seconds to get out of here-
amir: Ace.
jake: ... crawling on your knees like a dog, before I shoot you in the face-
amir: I don't wanna do this... but I've a real knife!
amir: Will Ace ever come to his senses? Is Jocelyn really a double agent?
pat: Please, stop talking.
amir: Will the evil, ugly scientist shut up and let me finish? All these answers and one more next week on Ace and Jocelyn, astronaut accountants from outer space.
amir: I mean, are you really going to tell me that you'd rather be at the Yankee's game right now?
jake: No, telling you would mean I have to talk to you, so no, I'm not going to tell you anything.
amir:  I mean, I paid for half of that slice, so I don't even know why you're even--
jake: Well I paid for both of yours.
amir: Okay, wow.  You're really going to be that petty about this, aren't you?
jake: Yeah I guess so, I guess so.
amir: Alright. I'm gonna leave. 
jake: Be my guest, please.
amir:  Alright, fine, I'll stay.
amir: I know why you're pissed at me.
jake: Cuz you ruined the game for me.
amir: No, because you bought me this..  and we weren't even able to enjoy most of the game together.
jake: I didn't buy you that fucking hat!
amir: Okay! Relax, you took money, and you bought it for me, I mean, what's the big--
jake: I didn't even do that!
amir: Ok, com'e on, compromise, right? Meet me in the middle, and then--
jake: Nope. Just stop talking, actually. That's good.
amir: Alright. I'm gonna stop talking, IF you talk to me for the rest of the day, AND, you talk to me on Thursday, Friday--
jake: How about I just walk home and you take the subway by yourself? 
amir: Awuwuwuwait okokokokok.  Come on. I won't say anything. Thanks for the hat, and that's it, or whatever.
amir: Jake! Thank god I found you! That was EPIC! 
jake: Aight look, I don't think I should be seen with you, just in case they're still looking for you, alright? Nothing personal, just get the fuck away--
amir: Aight. Good call, we'll split up, we'll cover more ground.
jake: Sure.
amir: Thanks for the hat. BUT, if we stay together, they won't expect it, and maybe, Ill vote for that option because, I don't wanna be not near you right now, so. Just a--..  Just a tought! Just a tought! 
amir: Alright, we're here at Yankee Stadium, Jake got me this hat ,--
jake: Nope.
amir: --and we're best friends, right? Would you agree with that?
jake: No I wouldn't.
amir: I bought-- heh. I bought the tickets, so. What would you--
jake: I said I'd take a picture, I didn't say anything about saying we were best friends. Now MOVE the camera.
amir: Fine.
amir: Excuse me? Hi. Uh, can you take a photo of myself and my friend?
woman: Sure.  Um..
amir: Get out hats. 
woman: ..Ok, but this is still in video mode.
amir:  Ok, figure it out. Don't be an idiot, right?
woman: E-excuse me?
amir: Excuse me, yeah, excuse me I'd give the camera to such an idiot 
woman: Hey! Hey! Lemme go!
amir: C'mon, Jake, hit her!

outro:
amir: Jake, who's your favorite Yankee and why.. don't you want to sleep over to-  Ohh my god. Hey look, dude hey! Come here. Hats, dude. Come buy me one, or stand here while I buy one, so it'll look you--
Jake and Amir sit across from each other at their desks. Amir is playing with open scissors in his hair.
amir: Jake. Have I asked you my one question today-
Jake cuts in before Amir is done.
jake: Just ask it.
amir: E equals M C two. What's that about?
Amir cuts his hair with scissors.
amir: Ah. Did you see that?
jake: No, do it again.
amir: I was like scratching my head, right? And then I just went like-
Amir cuts his hair again.
amir: -like that. Look, look at this.
Jake looks amused.
jake: Yeah. Not bad.
amir: I didn't know scissors could cut hair. What should I do?
jake: Um, I guess even it out.
Jake grabs the front of his hair.
jake: I think you just have to take that front chunk.
Amir mirrors Jake's demonstration.
amir: This?
jake: Take the front chunk. Sarah come here.
Sarah comes over.
jake: And uh, you just have to even it out, just take it all.
sarah: Did he cut his hair with that scissors thing-
jake: Scratching thing.
sarah: -scratching thing.
amir: I'm gonna cut just a little.
jake: No I think you, it's really uneven. You gotta go-
sarah: Farther down.
jake: Yeah.
amir: This is a lot.
jake: Yeah, it's not as much as you think it is.
sarah: It's gonna look good.
Amir looks at Jake.
amir: I trust you.
jake: I know.
Amir cuts the large chunk in the front of his head that Jake told him to.
amir: It's so tough.
Jake and Sarah smile.
jake: Just work through it.
sarah: It's gonna look-
jake: It's gonna look ace!
sarah: -yeah, it looks great.
Amir holds up the chunk of hair he cut off, looking worried.
jake: There you go.
amir: This seems like a lot.
jake: It's not that much. It's honestly not as much as you think.
Amir cuts more off.
jake: There you go.
amir: I mean, look at this.
Jake looks at Sarah.
jake: Girls are really gonna like that, right?
sarah: I, I love it.
Amir looks at Sarah.
amir: I don't care what you think. I care-
Amir points the scissors at Jake.
amir: -right?
jake: I think-
amir: I have one best friend. It feels like a little too short to me, but I'm gonna keep doing it because I respect you and know that you wouldn't knowingly hurt me. Just like I've never knowingly hurt you.
Jake and Sarah pause.
Amir keeps cutting.
jake: Amir...get the back.
amir: Done! Boom.
THE END.

jake: Does she?
amir: Yes, she's a registered nurse. And my dad is like this toolbox-extraordinaire, it pains me to call him.
jake: What does that even mean?
amir: Alright, perfect example. Last day of college, right? He comes to pick me up in a U-haul. Right of the bat, that's fucking nutso. But this guy honks the horn to get my attention. I freaked. I mean, tell me you understand.
jake: If that's, I mean, if that's a classic example, I would say--
amir: He's a paediatrician, which sounds like "Ooh, cool, you're a doctor". But, yeah, a doctor for kids.
jake: That's really... that's a really noble profession.
amir: I know, it's so noble, it's like
jake: You don't know, 'cause noble's a good thing.

amir: Where are you going?
jake: I'm going to talk to Dan about a script I wrote.
amir:  Alright, I'm coming with you because I rewrote it and then I sent it off to him. Follow my lead, and never don't follow my lead.
dan: Cool, Caveman Frat Party. Uh, honestly, right off the bat, I like it, it's good.
amir: Honestly, right off the bat, no shit.
dan: Uh... Ok.
dan: Bottom of page one, the main character sees a McDonald's burning down in the distance and he starts to cry, and I don't get that, so I was wondering what's-
amir: Wow- whoa-like- what- It's the saddest thing somebody can see, so I think, like, when you cry, it's not-
jake: It's- it's- you can- It's cuttable, right? You can cut that.
dan: Cuttable, so yeah, I'll- I'll cut that, then.
amir: Well... Ahh, Ok. Uh, that's fine. It happens again.
dan: Yeah, it happens on every page, so I'll just-
dan: Oh, yeah, you numbered the pages wrong, which is borderline impressive 'cause it's automated software.
amir: Yeah, I don't use software. I just  write all- I do the-
dan: So, this section  I felt the dialogue could be almost half the length because you can get what you're trying to say just quicker, snappier.
amir:  Yeah, yes, yes, yes, very. Aw, half the length, and then you can get it to change, just get it across and then-
jake: What's he talking about?
amir: This script.
jake: More specifically.
dan: Oh, here's a thing. Uh, audience lolz go here. Guys, let's not tell the audience when to laugh, let's just write funny stuff and trust it.
amir: Def.
amir: More specifically? I don't know, he's saying that everything is long. But, that's good, and it should be longer. As lo- er- as lo- the longer the better.
jake: That's the opposite of what he just said.
dan: Page 19.
jake: That's the exact opposite of what he said.
amir: So why are all good movies three hours plus, right? What, does that make sense?
jake: There's a lot of good, short movies.
dan: Alright, cool, come on.
dan: Scene directions. So here it says this shit is crazy insane.
amir:  This shit is crazy insane-o.
dan: Right.
amir: High pitched voice, right?
dan: Yeah, I see that you wrote that, but what does that mean? That doesn't even...
jake: He drew a picture of a fireball.
amir: Fireball, right there.
dan: Right, and Jake, that's the thing to generally not do.
jake: Well, yeah, I couldn't- I  couldn't agree more.
amir: couldn't agree less... with that.
dan: Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake. All the character names are Jake.
amir: Yes.
dan: You can't name the characters Jake-
amir: Ok.
dan: Because people need to know-
amir: We don't want to spoon-feed our audience.
dan: I don't know if I want to do this anymore.
amir: I know.
dan: As a job.
amir: Oh, as a job.
dan: Will Ferrell, I doubt-
amir:  Frank the Tank!
dan: Is not gonna be in it because he's Will Ferrell.
amir: Yeah, well, the way I cast my characters is I- I- I aim for the moon and then I shoot myself.
dan: You just said you're gonna shoot yourself.
amir:  You're gonna let him talk to me like that.
jake: Yep.
amir: Ahh.
dan: So a couple more things.
amir: Alright, you know what, you haven't stopped bitching about this script since you got here.
dan: I'm trying to give you constructive criticism.
amir: Hah, yeah. More like destructive cynicism.
jake: How did you learn those words?
dan: Cool, so you know what? We got a good first line, we got a good last line, I'll just take it from there.

jake: It's a DVD, alright? I borrowed it from Patrick Cassels, and he was gracious enough to let me borrow it. Don't mess it up.
amir: I'm going to break it.
jake: Why?
amir: Because I'm a retard. That's why.
amir: That is not what I said!
jake: Okay, it's my story, right? So let me tell it: and he was doing the high voice and everything. He was like,  I'm gonna break your DVD! I'm going to break your DVD.
pat: Jake, I don't care about that. Just tell me what happened to my DVD.
jake: Cassels, I'm getting there.
jake: I'm asking you politely: please calm down.
amir: Okay, after I break it, I wanna have a sleepover with you, and we can discuss-- all night-- how much we hate Pat.
jake: Don't even ask that, okay? You know the answer.
amir: Jake. Look how bendy it is.
jake: Jesus Christ...
amir: I'm so stupid!
jake: And then he just broke it in half.
amir:  Did that redheaded homo put you up to this?
pat: Don't bring Rosie into this. He's too dumb to defend himself.
jake: Y'know, Rosie was there! Why don't we ask him?
pat: Fine. Rosie, what happened?
rosie: Well...
to be continued...
jake: Y'know, Rosie was there! Why don't we ask him?

amir: And... I feel bad too, so, here. 
pat: Its-- a paper towel?
amir: Well, take it before I change my mind.
amir: Can I borrow this?
END
amir: Jake, you know how when a man is sexually aroused, I was just thinking about it, how his penis becomes erect because blood flows into it, the appendage? So...
jake: Did you know that if too much blood flows into it, his dick can actually explode?
amir: Yes.
jake: I'm kidding.  Got you!
amir:  I wanna throw this hammer so that it hits right in between your eyes.
jake: Ok, that's weird, because that's the opposite of what I want to happen.
amir: Well, opposites attract, so, close your eyes.
jake: Doesn't really make sense here.
amir: I don't think I'm explaining it right.
jake: No, you're explaining it fine.
amir: It's not gonna hit your eyes  like either the left one or the right one, those are gonna be fine.
jake: Just, yeah, in the middle,  I know. I get it. I just don't want it, I don't want it to hit any part of me at all.
amir: I feel like I'm doing the hard part by throwing it, and then you're not doing anything back, you know, like you're not bringing anything.
jake: Well, some people might say that I have to, I have the tough job of ex- trying to convince you not to throw it.
amir: Ok. But you can't convince me not to do this, I'm so set. Like, I, it's already happened in my head.
jake: Still, I could probably say something like-  Oh. What happened?
amir: Huh.
jake: You Ok?
amir:  Yee.
jake: Yee, you're Ok.
amir: Yee.
jake: Yee, Ok, what did you hurt?
amir:  I didn't hurt anything, I'm juuuu-ah!
jake: You're just...
amir: I'm fine.
jake: You're grunting.
amir: I'm grunting because I, oh, my head hur- I have a headache.
jake: Oh. Why does- Did you- Are you sure you didn't hit your hand with a hammer?
amir:  No, it just- It feels super swollen, like right around here. Is it, like, real- It look- It feels like it's throbbing.
jake: Your head doesn't, your head looks fine. Your hand, though, looks really bad.
amir: Oh, no, yeah, I just spilled it in lemonade.
jake: No, I can see bone.
amir: Raspberry lemonade.
jake: Doesn't explain the bone.
amir: Ok, uh, ooh, I'm gonna pass out because I'm in a lot of pain.
jake: Right, yeah.
amir: But I'm pretty positive you're not right. 
jake: Yeah, I dunno, I think I'm right, but it's a good idea. Why don't you take a nap, maybe we'll go to the hospital when we- 
amir:  Jake, did it hit? Jake.

jake: Oh my god! It smells terrible over here.
amir: Releaks, Jesus, it smelled fine two hours ago.
jake: What did it smell like before that?

amir: Would you rather have--
jake: Whoa, whoa I said you could sit here quietly and bounce as long as you didn't interrupt anything I was doing.
amir: Fine! Would you rather have an infinite amount of chicken nuggets or an infinite amount of money?
jake:  Um... wow. Oh, geeze. That's tough. Where are the nuggets from?
amir: Yes, that's what I asked! Yeah! They're chicken McNuggets from the D's!  From the D's! From the D's! From the D's!
jake: Oh, from the D's, from the D's...Um, I guess definitely the money. I'd take the infinite amount of money.
amir: Uh, okay. Where would you put the money?
jake: Oh, uh--
amir: All of a sudden it's more difficult--
jake: No, I'd probably put it into a bank or something. Uh, like, where would you put your infinity nuggets?
amir: In my stomach.
jake: In your stomach. Okay, that would kill you. You would die.
amir: Straight up.
jake: Straight up, you have a human stomach and you would die. Here's a would you rather from me.  Would you rather go onto your side of the desk and just--do some work and let me appreciate you and value our friendship  because you respect me or--
amir: Okay here's an impression...!
jake: Or would you rather be a fucking loud piece of crap--
amir:  Here's an impression! Ah!
jake: Know that you're being--
amir: Ah!
jake: What is that, you're just not gonna let me talk--
amir: Ahhhh. All right, here's an impression. 
jake: Fine. Of what?
amir: Here's an impression of a normal guy.
jake: Great.
amir: You know what's a super neat invention? God, I don't know if it has a name but those luggages on wheels are the most convenient thing in the world. Like, I graduated college three years ago, and I find myself travelling a lot more, just--the difference between holding one of these luggages and rolling them? It's night and day. It's absolutely night and day. And these airports are so expansive! I mean, have you been to the new airport in Atlanta? Terminal A's on one side of the city, I feel like I need an airplane to get to the other side of the airport. I mean, it's just absolutely obscene. And--you know I'm a jogger. I mean, I like to jog. But the problem isn't the jogging, it's--it's stopping, right when I stop, I'm feeling this--this  tightness in my arch and in my toes. And, you know, I go to the orthopedic surgeon and he's telling me it's plain orphochitis and I want a second recommendation, it's just unbelievable what kind of--and I am blabbing so much about myself and I cannot believe how self-centered I've been. We should get some coffee one time this week. What are you doing on Thursday? I'm going to an opera or such, I don't know, some gay shit like that, it's just like a work in progress you know? I don't know...  Here's a would you rather that's a freestyle! Would you rather hump a moose, a big dead--
jake: Amir? What's up, is everything okay? What's the emergency?
amir: I knew you'd find me here.
jake: Yeah, you told me exactly where to come.
amir: Y'know, not a day goes by that I don't think about your mother.
jake: So no emergency?
amir: You were confirmed in a church like this. Not much bigger than this actually.
jake: No, I wasn't ever confirmed. You called me five times begging me to come here. You wept on the phone.
amir: She never even got to see you play lacrosse. How do you think that makes me feel.
jake: Okay, tell me if you remember leaving me these three voice mails.
amir : Okay, when I think about how your brother and you treated her, it just kills me--
voicemail: Dude it's Amir, this is an emergency, it's an emergency, if you don't come I think I'm definitely OH MY GOD I'M GONNA DIE!
Jake this is not a joke, I think I'm definitely gonna die--
amir: Allright fine, turn it off, okay?! And relax! There is an emergency!
jake: Okay what is it?
amir: I wanna shoot a chill-ass lip dub in here. Just like a chill-ass lip dub in a church.
jake: A lip dub?
amir: Yeah it's like basically you lip sync a song and we put the music underneath, so it looks like you're singing.
jake: In an abandoned church in Poughkeepsie.
amir: Whatever, in a thing, I don't know, but like, as I'm singing, like set fire to shit, and at the end it just goes pfff, and it explodes, so...
jake: So what's the emergency?
amir: I don't know, a church blowing up. Is that-it sounds like an emergency to me.
jake: Yeah, it's an emergency you're causing. I guess I'm glad I came here to stop you from burning down a church.
amir: Not only that, but you have to shoot it for me too. You have to be the one who shoots it because I'm the one who's singing, and then what are you gonna bring to the table.
jake: I'm gonna go.
amir: Ah, w-w-w-wait a second.
jake: Jesus. I'm gonna go!
amir: Wait, c'mon, you said you'd shoot it, right?
jake: No.
amir: Okay, then say it now then, please.

amir: And then half of it... Ah, my head hurts. Heh.
jake: It's- Are you.. are you gonna use it? You know, plug it in, spin it around, do all that--
amir:  I was just about to spin it around when you said it--
jake: You're spinnin' it. That is just.. so fun. Careful, it gets hot!
amir:  I know, ah, Jesus! It started to get a little hot...
jake: Yeah, it gets really really hot.
amir: ...when you said that. So.
jake: No, I know.
amir:  Okay. Good.
jake: You just-- Smells good, right?
amir: So we both have one, and, let's just leave it at that, at this point.  Uh, I'll let you know when yours gets here. I'm gonna listen to music now.
amir:  Did you say something about us getting the same piece of equipment?
jake:  Alright, I'm gonna take this back.  What are you listening to?
amir: That was.. this is the.. it's just ended and now the- I was listening to rap--
END.
jake: Ok what do you want?
amir: I need you to help me register to vote.
jake: You want to vote?
amir: Well, vote or die right?
jake: Do you think that's a real law?
amir: Well I don't want it to be, which is why I'm going to put no, and then... 
jake:  That asks if you are a US citizen.
amir: Ok, so, sheesh.
amir: I do nay have a legal birthday, and I def do not have a  social security numbre comprende? so-e help-e on that-e.
jake: I'm so mad I understood all of that.
amir: 
amir: I mean honestly I'm leaning towards voting for both.
jake: You can't do that.
amir: Michael Both, the Libertarian candidate.
jake: Is that, is that a real guy?
amir: I don't know, I don't know what I just said.
amir:  I tink I am down to vote today.
both: I think I'm down to vote today.
jake: No you can't do that, election is November 4th.
amir: Ok cool cool,  tomonge it is!
both: Tomorrow it is.
jake: No, it's not.
amir: 
amir: I don't know, I'm like conflicted because one guy says the other guy is bad and then the other guy says the other person is bad so, like I think I'm just going to vote for the last person I hear talk.
jake: Maybe you shouldn't... 
amir:  Hey! Don't touch my pen.
amir: What's a blue state?
jake: Democratic.
amir: Ok, so red state is Nazi?
jake: Republican.
amir: Same thing.
jake: I can't decide if you're being pointing or stupid.
amir: Same thing.
jake: Got it, stupid.
jake: Obama is the democratic, black dude.
amir: HE'S BLACK?!
jake:  John McCain is the old white dude.
amir:  HE'S WHITE?! HE'S A REPUBLICAN?!
jake: Don't talk like that.
amir: SORRY?! Sorry.
jake: Sorry, good.
amir: 
jake: You done?
jake: A lot of people are taking into account the VP candidate.
amir: Yeah, VP is super importante.
jake: Yes, which you know stands for...
amir: Rainbow.
jake: Vice President. Rainbow?
amir: No, you said vice... I said vice President, what did you say?
jake: Who's the last person you voted for?
amir: Uh, Gerald Ford?
jake: How old are you?
amir: Oh this was in 2006.
jake: Ok, so you're just not smart.
amir: Yeah, he lost.
jake: By a lot.
amir: Yeah, by a lot.
amir: Man, why can't you run for president? My decision would be so much easier.
jake: Don't do that.
jake: Ok, what's your address?
amir: Well, like tonight I'm crashing at your place, so do I put that address or?
jake: No to both.
amir: Ok, the first one wasn't a question.
amir:  Cuz you pale in  comparison to Sarah. So, I dunno.
jake: That was, that was actually clever. That was kind of clever, you should write that down.
amir: Actually, I already just forgot it. Something about... Dick Cheney in your uh I dunno, forget it.
amir: And done-zo so  thank you for nothing.
jake: What are you doing?
amir: This is one vote that stays private!
outtakes at the end:
amir: HE'S A REPUBLICAN?!
jake:  stop talking like that.
both: SORRY?! 
jake: Let's do that.
jake: Ok, rules are as follows: you're allowed to stay here--
amir: IF, we have to high five every home run, I know, and we have to create ten inside jokes, you don't have to tell me--
jake: Ok, incorrect. Every inning you stay here is a week that you're not allowed to talk to me.
amir: Ok. But, I was thinking about that, what if it's like weeks in the past.  Oh, yeah) So like, weeks that we didn't know each other--
jake: Before, ok,  um no it's gonna be future weeks. Got it?
amir: Yeyeah, fo sho, fo sho.
jake: Oh!  That's gone. 
amir:  That is aout of there! Ah!
jake:  I'm gonna call Kunal. 
amir:  Kunal him! Ah, right now!
jake:  Yeah. He loves the Red Sox. I'm gonna  rub this in his face.
amir:  I know. Ok me too.
jake:  Uh, yo dude, I--
amir:  HHHEY YOU FUCKING PIECE OF SHI--
amir:  Jeff is an asshole, Rosie's an asshole, I wouldn't be caught dead hanging out with Patrick Cassels...
jake:  Hey, Kunal, it's Jake, ahh, just call me back, alright? We'll ahh, I just gotta talk to you. Alright. See you later.
amir:  I don't see why you wanna hang out with anyonnne else, buuut meeeeee...
jake:  Stop stop stop stop stop stop noww... 
amir:  Two to one!
jake: It's eleven to one. 
amir: Oh ok. I thought those were Roman Numerals.
amir:  I think I'm gonna take a nap. Let me know if Kobe  hits that touchdown. 
jake:  Wrong player, wrong sport, wrong team, and that pronunciation of Kobe's name: intentional?
amir:  Yeeeeee--
jake: Wrong pronunciation of the name. That is a record for you.
amir: Huzzah!
jake: Not a good one.
amir: Zah-hah!
jake: Not a word.
amir: Guess who! 
jake: No one else is here, and you came from the front of me, so that's pretty easy--
amir: I clogged your toilet. I clogged it.
jake: . Use too much paper, huh?
amir: . No I didn't use any paper, so I guess guess again?
jake: Ohh my God.
amir: I'm done. .
jake: Where is everybody? I invited everyone over like an hour ago.
amir: I know, it's so weird. Well, I guess it makes sense if you think about it, cuz like a lot of 'em were talk-- honestly, a lot of 'em were like talking shit about us, and I was like, I dunno, it's like weird, because like, you have to think about it, do you want those types of people at your house if you-- I mean if you have the choice, maybe you would rather not. Like do you have-- do you have any wine? .

jake:  What are you doing?
amir: What? It's funny?
?girl: Are you . . . ticklish??
jake: Let's find out. ?
girl:  What was that?!?
jake: Uh, nothing.
?girl: No, it's not nothing.?
jake: It was.?
girl: No, listen...again.
?jake: Yeah, no. ?
girl: Yeah! What is that???
jake: Uh, come back. Don't investigate! It was just a cat!?
girl: Oh my god! I love cats! One time my cat ate pizza, isn't that silly?  OH MY GOD!
?amir: You're going to die now! ?
 ?
jake: You're not, it's fine. ?
amir:  Sup?  Sup??
jake: Why'd you do that?
?amir: Works every time!
?jake: I know it works every time, I'm asking you why you do it every time. ?
amir: I crushed my skull trying to bench press a TV, and died instantly. Why don't you cut my some slack?!
?jake: You haven't answered my question.
?amir: Whoa, hold on a second, I'm going to put on the SyFy channel. I think there's a special on ghosts...like me!

?jake: My pizza!?
amir: I'm not even having some of the slices, just picking off some of the 'ronis.
jake: I see what you're doing and I still don't want you to do that. And how come you can pick off pepperonis with your hands but they go right through dishes when it's your turn to wash them? How does that work?

amir: Sometimes when I get nervous I start sweating this goo thing, I gue- I dunno, I think you're making it worse though.
jake: Disgusting! Why are you on my computer in the first place?
amir: I already told you, I have a gay-ass Dell desktop computer and my dad won't buy me a new one because I DIED! Argh! Is that a MacBook or a MacBook Pro?
jake: How about you just leave?
amir: Something tells me you won't be very pissed when you check your Facebook status update. I changed it.
jake: Really? Why don't you just get me a towel?! Right now!
?amir: Did you check yet? It's fly as shit.
?jake: No, I haven't and I don't want you going on my Facebook any--?
amir: It says, "I'm at the gym, hooking up with a hottie. Hit up the cell."
jake: Awesome.
?amir: So... ?
jake:  Thank you.
amir: Oh, but I said it 'cellie',  which is like a new, cool way of saying it. Remember I told you to say it like that last week.?
jake: Why are you still here?! ?
amir: I told you, I choked on a golfball 12 years ago, and I can't leave!?
jake: No, I mean, why are you still in my room?
?amir: OK, I guess I think I know when I'm not wanted.
jake: Don't just turn invisible, I know you're still here.
amir: Oh! Let me make you one of my patented smoothies! They are re-donkey-lips. 
jake: Did you download Kazaa? ...I thought this was dead, like you.
amir:  Is this too loud?
jake: Yes.
amir: Oh my ghost!  Ah, this is insane. Come here and smell it, unless you can smell it from over there. Can you smell it from there, is that why you're not coming here?  OK, give me a dollar to drink this? I'm just going to do it and you're going to owe me a buck. You're fine with straight owing me cash? ...OK, I did it.  OK, so dollar right there and uh, I'll just take it from the twenty that I borrowed from you earlier. Remember? Jake, are you-are you pissed at me?

Jake and Amir are sitting on a couch in Jake's apartment.
jake: Okay, today is the most important day of our lives.
amir: FUCKING VOTE ALREADY!!!
jake: Don't... swear, but that's the correct message. Everybody needs to vote.
amir: I don't care if you're white or black, if you're 9 or 90, just go-
jake: Well you can't... you can't be 9.
amir: You can be 9, I was 9. Still not convinced?! Call Jake at -446...
jake: No, don't... what are you, what are you doing?
amir: ...9701. And then that's it.
jake: You can't give my phone number out. You know, don't tell me
your vote doesn't count because you live in California or Texas...
amir: Or France or Iraq, just please go out-
jake: It might not... it might not count if you live those places because you have to be an American citizen.
amir: This isn't an American election. This is a global election. Everybody-
jake: It sounds... it sounds smart but I know it's not because you don't mean it as a metaphor. Today is the day, this is it-
amir: Whoever gets the most votes wins. Straight up.  It's that simple. Who you voting for Jakey?
jake: Well, it's personal I'm not gonna-
amir: I'm gonna tickle it out of you! 
jake: Don't touch me!!
Silence.
amir: Fine. V-O-T. Vote!
jake: E.
amir: E. Votey. 'sup votey? It's your birthday.
jake: V-O-T-E vote. Everybody has a voice.
amir: Can't speak, can't vote. Straight up.
jake: That's... not what I meant so...
amir: You only get one vote in your whole life. One! Make it count!
jake: That's not even close to being true. Why are you still watching this video?! Go vote!
amir: Vote for president! Vote for American Idol! We don't care, just vote! Anything!
jake: No, well... vote for... vote for president though.
amir: Okay, you want four more years of Taylor Hicks?
Black screen.
jake: Hey look, promise me you'll take the number out.
amir: Yeah for sure. Nobody, hey listen to me, nobody will know your phone number.
917-446-9701 Call Now! flashes repeatedly.
jake: Okay, thanks.
Jake slaps Amir on the leg, Amir is obviously in pain but makes no sound.
jake: Get out of my apartment now.
amir: I'm not mad.
jake: You don't have a reason to be, so.
amir: Yeah, well we passed by two McDonald's on the way here?
jake: I remember, you tried- yeah, you tried to run into them.
amir: Yeah, well, lucky for you, I came prepared to this little shit hole, so. 
jake: Looks empty.
amir:  What the hell? How did I already eat them?
jake: There's one in your mouth now.
amir:  Agh, God, that was weird. 
jake: Will you please put those away? I'm trying to teach you to eat like a regular person.
amir: Ok well regularly I eat forty to ninety McNuggets a day.
jake: Just look at the menu, ok? Just see if there's anything you can eat that's not a nugget.
amir: These prices are obscene! It's like $8.95 for a sandwich!
jake: You pay a dollar off the Dollar Menu for a nugget, right?
amir: Yeah..
jake: How many packs a day do you buy?
amir: ..Twenty..
jake:  K well- th- what're you-
amir: I mean but they're only a dollar each!
jake: Exactly! It's...
amir:  Achekekedichediditee! 
jake:  I.. I didn't.. understand that one.
amir: I said, I think I'm going to sneeze, but then it went away. So.
jake: Did you say the whole thing? Like I'm gonna sneeze but then it went away?
amir: Nah, I said I think I'm gonna sneeze, and then 
amir:  Whoa! A dime! A straight-up dime came out of my nose. 
jake: That's disgusting.
amir:  A ten cent piece came out of my nose!--
jake: That's a penny.
amir: Oh, okay. Either way, I'm paying for dinner tonight.
jake: It's.. one cent. So you're not.--
amir: Is it? Ok yeah. Well that's- that's what came out. Who knows what's still in there. Tickle my nose. 
jake: I'm not.. I don't wanna tickle your nose.
amir: Alright.
jake: Let's just make normal conversation that doesn't make me wanna throw up.
amir: Ok, fine. Uhhh... How is.. your.. motherrrrr...- I mean I don't wanna talk about stuff like that, it's boring!
jake: ...
amir: ...Dinner tonight?
jake: Hey, question.
amir: One second.
jake: No. Did you delete all my computer files?
amir: Ugh, I so do not want to answer that question.
jake: Why?
amir: Because like, either way I'm an asshole.
jake: Just one way, really.
amir: OK, let's say I say yes. I did delete all your computer files, then I'm like a big meanie, so.
jake: The other way?
amir: I guess the other way would be like, all right, no, I didn't delete any of your computer files, then it's like, ooo...I'm the asshole who deleted all your computer files and then lied about it to cover it up or something. Just-
jake: Gotcha.
amir:  You're damned if you do, damned if you don't.  You're damned if you do, damned if you don't.
jake:  -if you do, damned if you don't.  All right, but you did.
amir: Yes, absolutely.
jake: 
amir: Or should I say, absol-fruit-ly.
jake: I think absolutely works.
amir: OK, more so.
jake: Oh, you broke my keyboard too, huh?
amir: Yeah, I did that one fo' sho'.
jake: Fo' sho', fo' sho'.  How would you feel if I broke your computer?
amir: I mean, honestly, I might straight up murder you.
jake: OK, so you understand that it's annoying--
amir: Did you fucking touch my computer?
jake: No. That's an example like--
amir: Answer the question, bitch! Did you touch my computer or not?
jake: I said I didn't, OK? I was saying 'if' just--
amir: All right, OK, you know, sorry, I'm just going to go outside, 5 minutes, I'm going to cool off, I'm going to come back, you're going to apologize, everything is going to be fine again.
jake: I'm not apologizing. I didn't do anything, so...
amir: All right, take a walk with me right now!
jake: I'm not-I'm not going anywhere, OK? I have to stay here and try to recover my files.
amir: Those files are gone. OK, trust me.
jake: Well, I backed them up recently so...
amir: Yeah, on an external hard drive, right? Yeah, I broke that too, so please! Are you really not coming on a walk with me?

intro:
jake: Hey, you're watching Jake and-
amir: Hey, wait, wait, wait, I'm putting on a mask.
jake: They can't see you!
amir: OK, that's what the mask is for.
Jake is sitting at his desk on his computer. Amir crawls on the floor from behind him. Jake does not see him. Amir shoots up from the floor.
amir: BOO!
jake: Oh my god!
Amir laughs.
jake: What is wrong with you?
amir: What? I was just scaring you. It's a joke.
jake:  yeah.
amir: You were legit scared!
jake: No, um, I'm just freaked out about the hand, you know?

jake: You didn't hear about this?
amir: No.
jake: There's a crazed axe murderer...
amir:  No.

amir:  Okaaaay stop!
jake: ...And its missing. They don't know where it is.
amir: OK, I don't want to think about that.
jake: Well you don't have to think about it. It's - I mean it's pointless anyway because it's far away  it's never going to-
Jake pushes his hand out the top of his polo. Because his arm is inside the shirt, it appears as though the hand is by itself.
jake:  OH NO!
Amir sees the hand and begins screaming hysterically. He grabs the hand and shakes while he continues screaming. While Jake is yelling, Amir begins to cry.
jake:  Oh my god! It's headed for us!  Ahhh!  It's killing me! It's killing me! It's murdering me! It's killing me!  I can't kill it! Ah my go-  ohhh, aw fu...
Jake decides to end the prank. He takes his arm out of his shirt and tries to calm Amir down. Amir is still crying.
jake: Hey, hey, hey, hey,  it was my hand. It was my...  No, no! Look!  Hey! Look at my shirt! There's nothing inside my shirt, right?
Amir has his hands to his face. He is no longer crying, but he is still whimpering. Jake shows his arms to Amir.
jake: And - and there's no hand. There's no hand. It was my hand all along.
Amir grabs onto Jake and starts hitting him with his right hand. Jake embraces Amir and pats him on his left shoulder.
amir:  I hate you! I hate you! I hate you! I hate-
jake: You're fine, you're fine, you're fine, you're fine, you're fine, you're fine. Come on, you okay? You're fine.  He's fine!
Cut to 8 co-workers staring confused and awkwardly at Jake and Amir.
jake:  He's fine, He's fine.
Cut back to Jake and Amir, who are hugging each other less tightly.
jake: He's a big boy. Smile like a big boy!
Amir smiles widely with his teeth clenched. His eyes are squeezed shut. Jake rocks him gently.
jake:  Smile like a big boy! Huh? You wanna get ice cream?
amir:  No.
jake: No, K,  you're fine, you're gonna be okay.  He's fine.

andy: Right
kiv: Sure
amir: We're down to three again, which is fine...
andy: We need a fourth.
jake: You said we needed--.
amir: We needed a fourth, but we realized four might have been too many, once I joined the group.
kiv: We've learned our lesson, we're--.

sarah: Oh, hey Amir. Uh, I heard you and Mike are really hitting it off.
amir: That's a bit of an understatement, don't you think?
sarah: Are, are you gay?
amir: What?! God, no. Why?
sarah: I mean, you know Mike's gay?
amir: OK, I'm not going to stand here and listen to you talk smack behind his back.
sarah: Amir, it's not a bad thing.
amir: Yes, Sarah, it is. Gay means bad, like if I wanted to insult your shoes and they were bad or whatever I'd be like Hey, you have
gay shoes. You have gay shoes.
sarah: Amir, gay means homosexual.
amir: I know. What does that mean?
sarah: It means that Mike wants to have sex with you.
amir: So you think Mike's a woman? Trust me, he's not.
mike: Oh hey guys.
amir: Oh hey Mike. I was just leaving.
mike: Hey Amir, do you want to go to the bathroom together?
amir: Sure, meet you in the men's room.
mike: Same stall?
amir: For sure.
amir: Hey Jake, it's Amir, I hope you don't mind, I put this song on your iPod. It's about your name so... J is Jake and A is for

amir: Mean to him? I was insulting him.
jake:  So yes.
amir: Yeah, definitely, yes, of course!

amir: We're all basically on a level playing field, right? So I make people feel worse about themselves, suddenly 'hey, this is pretty neat, I'm like a good guy all of a sudden' I feel better about myself when I put other people down. It like masks my insecurities.
jake:  I'm depressed that you get it, yet you still wanna do it.

kumail: Guess who?
amir: I don't know who you are, so I can't guess, right?
jake: That's what guessing is. Kumail!
kumail: What's up, brother? Oh, my god.  You must be Amir. I've heard a lot about you!
amir: Well, I've heard nothing about you.
jake: That's because I haven't seen Kumail, in like what, 13 years!
amir: Ho-oh, really? You haven't seen each other since you were negative four then?
kumail:  You were right, he can't even do basic math.
jake: Or talk.
amir: 
jake: OK, I'm going to go to the bathroom man, and when I get back, we have checking up to do.
kumail: Yeah we do!  
amir: So . . .
kumail: Shut the fuck up and help me find his pay stubs!
amir: Pay stubs?  God! Uh, he keeps them in Connecticut, in his house, in a safe.
kumail: Really? Darn. Because I found a bunch of them right here.
amir: Oh.
kumail: Now I know you're a liar.
amir: Uh.
kumail: This is not good for you.
amir: Yeah. I have to call Jake, I totally forgot but I have to call--
kumail: Give me that.
jake: Hey Kumail, you ready to roll?
kumail: Yeah, sure thing! This dude just threw his cell phone against the wall. 
jake: Again?
amir: No.
jake: God, you're stupid man.
amir: Jake. Dinner tonight. Right now! Trust me.
jake: Sure, yeah  because, did you know that Amir is the last person on earth?
kumail: Really? The very last person on earth?
jake: Yeah, that's the only reason I'd ever ditch dinner with you and have dinner with him.
amir: No, I'm not--
kumail: Zing!
jake: Later, dude.
kumail:  Later, dude.
amir: 
josh: You gotta stop doing this, man.
amir: OK, I didn't throw THROW THAT!  This time. Sorry. Uh, I shouldn't yell. OK, just, uh, so frustrating.

intro:  Amir- Ah, sorry I'm late. Uh, you're watching Jake and Amir.
amir: So, how was dinner last night with your long lost bro?
jake: Uh, it was good.  It was expensive, but it was good.
amir: Sounds good. Sounds expensive but it was good.
jake: You're just repeating what I say.
amir: Can't prove that. Why was it expensive?
jake: Uh, it's just that Kumail doesn't have like any money right now so I had to pay.
amir: He doesn't have any money?
jake: No. Not right now. But he has like this insanely good business idea which is why I invested my last $5,000 in it, and uh, it's going to make both of us rich.
amir: Insanely good business idea?
jake: Yeah, it's called scale.com. You step on your laptop and the site will actually weigh you.
amir: OK. That's MY idea, BITCH!
jake: I'm kidding! You think I would tell you the business idea? I don't even know it yet.
amir: But you said it was insanely good?
jake: It's called trusting someone. Your brother.
amir: My brother?
jake: My brother.
amir: Your brother?
jake: Shut up, all right? Nevermind.
amir: Jake, I don't think Kumail is the trustworthy guy you think he is.
jake: Why? Because I want to hang out with him more than I want to hang out with you?
amir: Yes, that. And yesterday when you were in the bathroom, he was like digging around, looking for pay stubs or whatever.
jake: Wow.
amir: Yeah, so . . .
jake: You've kept me from my own surprise party, you've spied on me in the bathroom, you poisoned my food, but this is a new low.
amir: Yes, but have I ever lied to you?
jake: Yeah, sure. You told me you had 60 beers once.  You said you never drop anything. You said you had some new girlfriend--
amir: OK, shut up!
jake: NO, YOU SHUT UP! My brother is finally back and I'm happy and he's going to make us both rich and for once I'm not going to let you f**k it up for me.
amir: Frine!
jake: Frine or fine?
amir: I don't know, why don't you ask your brother. He seems to know everything!
jake: You know what? Maybe I will, because he's in the kitchen right now and we're going to get lunch together, bitch!
amir: You're a bitch!
jake: You're a bitch.
amir: You're the bitch.
jake: You're a bitch's bitch.  Nothing?
amir: You're a ... bitch's bitch.
kumail: You know, Jake said he worked with a bunch of 5's and 6's but you are a legit 7.
sarah:  Uh, thanks.
kumail: I probably see myself doing you if you know what I mean?
sarah: Wow, that's pretty clear--
jake: Hey, Sarah!  Did you meet my brother, Kumail?
sarah: Yeah, just did.
jake: Cool.
kumail: Lunch time?
jake: Absolutely man, where to?
kumail: Wherever. You're paying.  Come on.

jake: And I found you, with the park ranger, three days later, unconscious in a stream.
amir:  Ok I was THIRSTY!
amir: What are you working on?
jake: It's that program I told you about, the Big Brother program. You know it's a good cause, you should sign up.
amir: It sounds amazing, I just- I just don't know...
jake: If you have the time?
amir: No I just don't know.. what it is.
jake: You sign up and they pair you with a kid.
amir: Can I choose who I get?

amir: Huh ok you're right, too soon, don't force it, UNLESS--
jake: N-no forcing.. anything!
amir: If I have to pay even one cent to this program then I don't wanna do it, you know?

amir:  Not one...... nickel. 
jake: Penny.
amir:  FU--
amir:  Alright let's say day one doesn't go according to plan, so I plan to ditch this little bugger, is that kosh?
jake:  Oh, lemme put in your language: no boy, it ain't kosh!
amir:  Yo, that ain't enough from discouraging me from signing up, messin' up his little life--
jake:  Well it SHOULD.
amir: Oh my gosh, look at us.  We're in the prime of our youth, and we're talking about helping out little kids! We should be getting laid!

jake:  What are you doing?
amir:  I knew you'd be jealous that I have forty-eight hot summer fashion tips and you have precisely zero.
jake:  Is the first tip dressing like a schizophrenic homosexual?
amir:  No, the first tip is white sunglasses.

jake:  And how does it feel?
amir:  Lightweight, sexy, really uncomfortable.
jake:  Tip number eight?
amir:  Nail polish!
jake:  I'm impressed that you know all this, but I wish you wouldn't use the little brain power that you have to memorize girls magazines.
amir:  If they were really girls magazines, would I know fifteen ways to freak HIM out in bed?
jake:  You wanna freak guys out in bed?
amir:  Yah, I like scaring people, and now I can do that, in bed.
jake:  Scaring people like boo?
amir:  No, scaring people like licking their toes.  Okay, really freaking them out.
jake: I think this is the most you have ever not gotten it.  And that's saying a lot.
amir:  I don't know why you're being angry Mr. Leo.  Today is your diva day.  You should act the part at a party.

jake: You fucked a pig, or you made out with a pig?
amir: I know, I'm just thinking worst-case scenario here.
jake: The worst-case scenario: You're already dead.
amir: Oh.. my god. So, well, we're hanging out, so this might be Heaven.
jake: Ooh, or Hell.
amir: Okay, quick little test: If we are dead , then, I can't KILL MYSELF right now!

amir: Well, if you wanna be green, then yeah we are.
jake: I'll be white.
amir: I'll be white too.
amir: Ooh, can I be the banker?

jake: Oh my god, you should go home.
sarah: I can't, I have too much work. I don't know what to do.
sarah: What are you?
jake: Nothing.
sarah: I'm just so scared.
sarah: What the?
amir: It hurt more than it looked like it did, okay! Why did this happen to me! Why...
jake: You're still covered in lotion.
intro: Jake - You're watching Jake and Amir.
Amir - Sweet goatee.
Jake - Shut up. Why do you not like it?
Amir - It's stupid.
amir: So obviously Jake is sick today.
pat: I didn't know that.
sam: Well, he is.
amir: Anyway, I've been looking for an understudy, or whatever. Someone to like, fill in his shoes when he can't make it to work.
sam: And we think you might have with it takes.
amir: Heh, one second Pat.  Cut me off again, and I will ban you from this project.
sam:  I understand, sir. I'm sorry, sir.
amir: Anyways, you guys both have scripts so why don't we just get this party started and don't perform into the camera.
sam: Jake.
pat:  Will you just let me work, please? You are insufferable!  Wow, this is actually really self aware, Amir.  I'm kind of proud of you.
amir: NEXT!
sam: Dinner tonight?
streeter:  Have I ever said yes to that? It's almost impressive, and not in a good way, how persistent you are.
sam: Ah thank you.
streeter:  Not a compliment.
sam: Yes, it was.
amir: All right, thank you, Streeter. Are you willing to shave your beard for this?
streeter: I don't even know what this is.
amir : Write down definitely.
sam: Definitely.
streeter: I can hear you.
sam: Who that crazy boy, living in a crazy void.
dan : ...I don't know what you're saying.
amir: Just read the script.
dan : I don't know what you're saying.
amir: That was actually really good.
sam: Agreed.
amir: Don't talk out of character.
sam: Sorrow.
amir:  I'm sorry, I'm just not feeling it.
jeff : Not feeling what? And why are you in the lunch room?
amir: NECK!
jeff: Why do you keep saying neck?
amir: This is terrible. Not one actor among these fools.
sam : In Troy, there lies the scene.
From isles of Greece
The princes orgulous, their high blood chafed,
Have to the port of Athens sent their ships,
Fraught with the ministers and instruments
of cruel war: sixty and nine, that wore
Their crownets regal, from the Athenian bay
Put forth toward Phrygia; and their vow is made
To ransack Troy.
amir : Could you imagine you as my friend, even for like a day?

jake: You're acting like you didn't say you were dead?
amir: N-n-no.
jake: You're terrible at being discreet while you are obviously playing a video game.
amir : Yeah, I don't even know what that means, so how could I be doing it?
jake: You do a lot of stuff your vocabulary isn't capable of describing, but that doesn't mean it's not happening.
amir: One second.
jake: For instance: you don't know what malnourished means.
amir: Correct.
jake: But, you eat a diet only of chicken nuggets.
amir : Can you just shut your pretty mouth and beat this e-mail for me?
jake: I'll tell you what. I'll take you out to dinner if you just make eye contact with me for 5 seconds.
amir: One.  Two-three-four.  Five.
jake: Five second in a row.
amir: OK, you didn't say that. You have to specify, right?
jake: All right. Catch. 
jake: Show me your hands.
amir : I'll show you one hand, how's that? And then, when I'm done with that, I'll show you my other hand.

EPISODE LINK
intro: Jake - Hi, you're watching Jake and Amir.
Amir - Or are you?
Jake - They are.
Amir - Ah. OK.
jake: I get it. It looks like a banana vagina, go back to your desk.
amir: Hey, babe.
jake: Wow, don't make that a thing you call me.
amir: Wow, you're not my MOM! So...dinner tonight?
jake: You just yelled at me and now you want to ask me to din--
amir: YOU JUST SHUT the f-f-front door...sorry. Dinner tonight?
jake: Even if you weren't yelling at me, I have dinner plans already.
amir: OK, just tell me which McDonald's we're going to and keep in mind that three of them won't have me back so to speak, and you know that!
jake: Not going to McDonald's, all right? I'm going to another restaurant called Nina's.
amir: Oh, I've been there.  That's that place where they have that thing where if you cuss at your waitresses you get free drinks.
jake: No, it's not.
amir: Yes it is.
jake: So you've done that?
amir: Yeah, I mean, it's not like this special deal that they advertise, it's like this special audio coupon that you can cash in. I'm surprised you didn't know that.
jake: I'm surprised you think it's a coupon.
amir: I mean, it's not like this physical coupon or whatever. It's like the same thing about like when you go to a restaurant and you order something that they don't have on the menu but they'll still give it to you, if you openly weep and you like throw a fit.
jake: Like a temper tantrum?
amir: Yeah, like a tempa-tension.
jake: Not what I said. So, do you do this often?
amir: No, you can't do it often! You can only do it once at every restaurant in the city. I mean, do you really not know that?
jake: I guess I just feel bad cashing in these types of coupons.
amir: Nah, don't feel bad. I mean, these ones are tame compared to the ones my cousin Leron cashes in.   He cashed in this one coupon --
jake : Don't keep going with this story, because I don't want to be implicated and I don't want to hear about what you and your weird cousin do in your free time. It really freaks me out! It freaks everybody else out, all right? Dude, just shut up!!
amir : once where he took hold of this waitress and he just basically, he pushed her in the back and he shoved her against the table and she's like 'Ah, my god!'  and just Jake, I'd do it a lot more, OK...
amir: I'd do it a lot more, if I wasn't so afraid of smelling, tasting, seeing waitress blood and stuff like that.
jake: OK, now I've lost my appetite.
amir: Sorry about that, babe.
THE END.

amir: Ah.
jake: You must've forgotten the entire night!
amir: Yeah! I think so. This is awesome!
jake:  Shit! I had no idea you could drink that much. Did you know you could drink that much?
amir: Yeah, definitely. Why? How much though?
jake: Try three bottles of vodka!
amir: Yeah! I knew that! I could drink more than that.
jake: I know you can because you had some fucking gin right afterwards!
amir: Oh yeah, we had the gymnastics.
jake: Yeah, they called you the gin guzzler, yo.
amir: Yeah, they call me the gym guzzler, yo.
jake: The gin guzzler. You were dancing. You were out on the dance floor. You were all being fucking weird. You were shaking your shit around.
jake: Yeah, everyone thought you looked like an asshole!
amir: OK. 
jake: Except for one girl.
amir: Oh.
jake: Who is kind of into it. She walks on over and she's all swaggin' it and you got your confidence all turned on--
amir:  Yeah.
jake: --and you grab her by the waist and--
jake: Her by the waist!
amir: Sure. 
jake: All right, not me. And you were like 'Hey, babe.' you kissed her right on the mouth.
jake: That's what I'm talking about. And then she fucking PUKED!
amir: Ugh!
jake: All over you, it was crazy! How do you not remember this?
amir: I do, uh, yeah.
jake: You were fucking cussing her out. You were all pissed about it--
amir: Stupid B.
jake: --bouncer, he comes over and he's like 'Hey, you yelling at this girl?'--
amir:  No!
jake: --and then her boyfriend came over--
amir:  Hey, man! No, no, no.
jake: Then, he flails you up against the wall--
jake: --and he's like 'I'm going to kick your ass' and you're fucking pleading with your eyes--
jake: --please don't take my life, please don't take my life. You're begging him with your eyes and he- You're freakin' peeing your pants. You're pissing your pants. He felt bad for you and he just tossed you out on the curb.
jake: You crawled back in and you were like 'Aw, fuck, please Jake, I need to get home--
jake: --let me borrow ten bucks to get home. Please, please, please.' Then I lent you ten bucks and I want that back now and I won't tell anybody about what happened last night.
amir: OK, I only have a twenty. But why don't you take it, and you don't tell anybody about last night, twice.
jake: Deal.  Hey, Rosie, movie is on me!  I feel bad.  Let me get another twenty, I don't want to make him walk. We're going to take a cab. We're going to cab it.
amir: You're going to cab it.
jake:  We're going to cab it.

Opening Sequence
amir: Gimme a J!
jake: No time to spell my name.
amir: Okay, I was spelling my name.
jake: Then you were wrong.
amir: Ah.
Episode
jake: Hey dude!
amir:  Hey dude, don't make it brr! 
jake: Yeah what's up? What are you doing?
amir: I'm just settling this area, making sure that everything is like... under... control...
jake: Sure sure, that's cool. Hey uh, quick question:  where the fuck is my stuff?
amir:  Huh?
jake: You were not wearing those a second ago.
amir: Sorry?
jake: My desk is empty, alright? Everything is gone.
amir: Ooooh, yeah! 
jake: 
amir: Have you ever heard of eBay?
jake: Yes.
amir: It's like an electronic bay...
jake: I said I heard of it. Did you sell my stuff on eBay?
amir: No. Well, I tried to. Def tried to. Tried to get some big players, big things, lots of bucks. Almost sold your computer for 10K.
Split two ways, how does that sound?
jake: How much would that be?
amir: 
jake: You know, never mind. If you didn't sell my stuff, where is it?
amir: Well, at first I didn't sell it, true. But then, lowered the price, you know.  Sans reserve,
no reserve, got lots of more fishies, reeled a couple in, made some deals.
jake: Okay, so earlier when you said you didn't sell my stuff on eBay...
amir: Oh yeah yeah, I meant like, the prices were so low I was practically giving them away. So it was like... it was like a steal, you
know?
jake: Yeah, it was a steal. You stole it from me.
amir: Sure, stole it and sold it brotha, I mean it's highway robbery, you know? What are we even arguing about anymore? I can't even
remember!
jake: I guess it's not an argument if you're just admitting everything.
amir:  Alright, problem-o solved-o!
jake: Okay, it's still not, I don't have any stuff!
amir: Alright, will you just go through your day like you normally would and then, if you happen to stumble upon a problem we'll take
it from there, we'll cross that river when we get to it, okay?
jake: Almost sounds logical, but right off the bat I have no damn computer to turn on.
amir: Alright, right off the bat you usually get some water before you turn your computer on, so it doesn't look like you're stumbling
through your day like you normally would, right?
jake: Fine, I'll get some water. 
jake:  Okay... What?
amir: 
pat: Where the hell is my computer?
amir:  We're in the clear! 
sarah: Oh, Amir stole it and put it on Jake's desk.
amir:  No way he's believing that. 
pat: I heard that.
amir:  No way. 
sarah: Are you okay?
amir: 
intro: Amir - I'm not doing the intro because I hate you. So.
Jake - OK.
Amir - Oh, I could never stay mad at you.
pat: And then Don Carleone says, 'I'll --
sarah and pat: make him an offer he can't refuse'!
pat: Oh my god.
sarah: So good.
pat: I love The Godfather.
sarah: I know, me too.
pat: Have you seen it?
sarah: No. So . . .
pat: Um, can I ask you a question?
sarah: Yeah, sure. What's up?
pat: What do you think of Jake and Amir?
sarah: What do you-what do you mean, what do I think?
pat: Well, you know, it seems like they hate each other, but I think recently, it's like, they're like legit best friends.
sarah: I don't know. I mean Jake still gets really annoyed.
pat: Yeah but, I mean, there's definitely an underlying respect they have for each other.  I sense it.
sarah: Well, that's true. And, I mean, Amir like sleeps over Jake's house constantly.
pat: Yes! And then remember Christmas? They went home together.
sarah: That's so true. You know, if you didn't know them and you're explaining them to someone, you could almost make an argument that they're like . . .
pat: What?
sarah: I mean they're probably not, but it kind of seems like . . .
pat: What?
sarah: . . . like they're gay lovers.
pat: Come on.
sarah: I mean, I'm just saying. I mean, the family visits, the sleepovers, they're always getting into these like lover's quarrels.
pat: Lover's quarrels?
sarah: Yeah, I mean . . . maybe. It's stupid, it's probably wrong, but...
pat: Yeah, I mean, Jake punched me when we slept together,  remember?
sarah: Yeah.
pat: I'm sorry.
sarah: No, it's OK. It's--
pat: That was way out of line.
sarah: It's fine. I mean, I just thought we weren't going to, uh...

INTRO Amir - Hi, I'm Russell Crowe and you're watching Jake and Amir.
Jake - You're not even trying to do his voice.
Amir - Whatevah.
amir: So then I'll all like, 'All right, everybody, hit the flippin' gr-floor.' And it's just's like  Ahhhhhh!
jake: You can't just come over here and be like 'So then I'll all like everybody get on the floor'. You can't just start stories in the middle, that's not how that works. What the hell is on your chest?
amir:  What's on it-what's on my--
jake: Looks like you wrote something on your chest.
amir: Impossible.
jake: It's pretty possible.
amir: Well, it was very, very, very difficult.
jake: Just take it off your shirt.
amir: Not yet. Trust me.
jake: All right. You don't have to take off your shirt, but now I'm--
amir: OK-ok-ok-ok-ok. 
jake: Wow, I haven't even fake bribed you yet.
amir: I know, I know, I just, whatever it is, I'll take it, you know?
jake : Happy half b-day to me. Now sit down.  Is today your half birthday?
amir: Like you didn't know.
jake: I don't think I get it. I don't-I don't get what you're trying to do.
amir: Basically, I thought I'd come in here, everybody would start losing their sheesh once they realized it's my halfie, and then instead of quelling them down 'cause everyone is so loud and stuff, I'd just remove my shirt and the message is displayed.
jake: It's not even polite.
amir: Well, I know. That's why I got Leron to write on my back, 'Thanks again everybody, sorry for making a scene but this is an office so let's all relax.'
jake: OK, that's not what that says.
amir: What do you mean?
jake: Didn't you at least double check in a mirror?
amir: Yeah! But everything was all backwards so it was difficult to read.
jake: I mean, there's a f***ing arrow.
amir: I know,  I thought it was a letter.
jake: Then you didn't know. You either knew, or you thought it was a letter.
amir: Then I thought it was a letter.
jake: OK, I know. Look, even if by some small miracle everybody in this office gave a s**t that it was your half birthday and they wanted to clap for you so loudly that you could even *ask* them to stop, if you needed to display a message on your chest, wouldn't you feel weird about admitting that you knew all of this all along?
amir: I'm going to f***ing kill Leron if there's an arrow on my back, I swear.
THE END.

jake: So then the trick is that there are these slits in the back of the cup. And you had to figure it out, it's pretty tough, but I did it. Kiss for the magician?

intro:
jake: Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir.
amir: You're ar rezy erz er erb
jake: You're not a robot.
It's daytime at a Las Vegas hotel. Jake and Amir are sitting at a desk in a hotel room. Jake has a deck of cards on the table.
jake: Blackjack is simple.
amir: Hey, that's a little racist for my taste. Maybe it shouldn't be a Jack, it should be a black, like a gangster.
jake: Okay, that's actually racist.
amir: Yes. Oh, yeah, yeah, okay.
jake: Right. The important thing to remember is that Jacks, Queens, and Kings are all worth ten.
amir: Okay, so how much is a ten worth?
jake:  Ten.
Amir looks upset at Jake.
jake: It's - okay.
Amir slaps Jake across the face with his right hand.
amir: When were you going to tell me that?
Jake and Amir are now playing with the cards. The cards are flat on the table so Jake can show Amir how to play.
jake: You have fifteen with the dealer showing ten. That would mean you want to hit.
Amir raises his right arm and tries to slap Jake again, but this time Jake blocks Amir's hand with his arm and slams it on the table.
jake: Not me.
Amir looks like he's in pain but moves his hand.
jake: I'm sorry.
amir: Nah, don't be. I messed up and you deserve to hit me.
jake: Okay
amir: I was kidding!
jake: Okay, you have a ten and a seven. How much is that worth?
amir: Thirty-one. Er! Twenty-one.
jake: No, seventeen.
amir: No. Yeah, seventeen. I thought you multiply them together or something.
jake: Would still be wrong.
amir:  Ah!
jake: What?
amir: Still be right. Okay, I think I'm ready to go downstairs and play.
jake: How many cards are dealt?
amir: Uh, Queen.
jake: No.
amir: Okay, just keep teaching me and stop being a dick about it? 
Amir is now holding the deck of cards in his hand.
amir: Alright, maybe we should learn how to count cards.  One,  two,  Aahh! Um, okay, let's go back to basic strategy.
jake: That's a basic strategy. 
amir: Yeah.
Amir has the deck of cards. Jake is looking away from him with his arms on the table. He is exhausted and pissed off. Amir pulls a card from the deck and holds it up to Jake.
amir: Was this your card?
jake: They're all my cards. You made me pick every card. 
amir:  Just a yes or no, and then we'll move forward.
jake: Yes.
Amir picks another card from the deck and shows it to Jake. Cut to Amir holding the deck in his left hand.
amir: And that's why they call me  the King of clubs.
jake: That's the seven of diamonds.
amir: I'm that - yes, I'm that too.
jake: You're a seven of diamonds?
Cut to Amir jumping up and down on his bed. Jake is looking away again. The deck of cards has been abandoned on the table.
jake: You know I don't have to teach you anymore if you don't want.
amir: Okay, okay, just give me just five more minutes! T-bag.
Amir jumps onto Jakes bed while Jake looks at him surprised.
jake: You know what? Let's play this instead.  If it's red, say fire. If it's black, say smoke.
amir: Smoke.
Jake puts that card down to reveal the next card.
amir: Fire.
Jake shoots the deck at Amir and the cards fly into his face. Amir squeezes his eyes shut, then looks sadly at the disorganized cards. Jake smiles.
jake: Come on, it's funny.
Amir still looks upset.
Cut to Jake knocking on the bathroom door. He looks full of regret.
jake: Amir, are you there? I'm really sorry.
amir:  I'm really sorry! Sorry for ever trusting you! 
Jake sighs and covers his face with his left hand. Amir opens the door again.
amir: You still there?
jake: Yeah, I'm here.
amir: Okay.

notes: Evidently, I know next to nothing about poker so I may have missed out on some lingo. I also am not completely familiar with all the guys' voices so some names may not be right when someone's talking off-screen. There were a ton of inaudible things I just couldn't put together so if y'all could help, that would be awesome comploodle. Be as nitpicky as possible. :P Oh, and a huge congratulations to the cumulative and collaborative effort of this subreddit to have now officially transcribed every single Jake and Amir video ever. Oh sheesh y'all.

amir: Later tron two-thousand and four, yo.-
jake: Alright.
amir: -This is beat.
Amir laughs.
jake: Peace out robot.
amir: Okay, bye.
jake: Bye.
Amir walks away, but runs back at the door, ramming into it with his body. Jake gets up. Amir ends up laying on the ground by the door with his glasses looking disheveled. Amir knocks on the door three times with his head.
amir: Hey dude, uh, me again. I think I left something in there. Can you open the door for a second.
Jake opens the door.
amir: Wassup?
jake: What's up?
amir: I fell.
jake: You fell.
amir: Down.
jake: Okay. Do you want to come in? You can come in if you want.
amir: Thank you so mu-
Amir tries sitting up, but is in too much pain and has to lie down again.
amir: Ow! Actually,ah, hey, I think I'm gonna, you need your space, right? So I'm gonna chill out here.
jake: Okay, fine.
amir: Yeah. We'll talk soon.
Jake gets up and let's the door close. As the door is closing Amir has a change of heart.
amir: Actually, you know you could probably carry me in.
The door closes more.
amir: Hey, J-j-j-j-j-, wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wai-
THE END
EPISODE LINK
intro:
jake: Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir
amir: Big whoop, so am I. Easy money.
jake: What?
amir: Whoa, Jake, I just realized something big. The sky is blue because of.. the scattering like, sunlight fragmi--mints, and then, a prism, and, your human eyes.
jake: That was smart. Even though you kinda went off into sentence fragments at the end there and made no coherent point, I think you're smart because you used big words. And then when you finished, you raised your eyebrows at me, which really solidified the point that you knew exactly what you were talking about.
amir: Yeah, o- I mean on a sunny day, reighley scattering gives the sky a blue gradient, dark in the zenith and light near the.. horizon!
jake: Wow. It sounded a lot like you were reading from Wikipedia, but I know for a fact that you couldn't have been because you were raising your eyes to look at me every few seconds to prove that you were speaking your own original thoughts.
amir: Absolowly.
jake: You mean absolutely.
amir:  No, uh, I mean absolowly, which is.. Franish for.. absolutely.
jake: Oh, ok. At first I thought you misspoke, but the way you spun it around on me, and me realize that I was wrong, makes you look smart, and me look stupider by comparison. . Especially because I didn't even know Franish was a language, but I know that it must be, because you said it with such conviction and confidence. Even now as I talk, you're just nodding your head, which makes me realize that you knew you were right all along--
amir:  Yo yo SO, son, I wanna jump around and make ya go.... AAAH! 
jake: That was a tight rap.  Normally raps have to rhyme, but you delivered it in such a way that made you seem like a professional freestyler. You know, even when you seemingly couldn't think of the next word you kind of just went aaah and shook your head, which made me realize that you were purposefully done talking. As a result, I'm your good friend now and I want to hang out more, take you to McDonald's and just generally hang you with you as much as possible.
jake: Now you're raising the roof, which I thought was outdated, but I know that it can't be outdated because you're doing it. I've grown to respect you so much in the last few minutes. I'm realizing you're not getting my sarcasm, even though I'm laying it on very thick.
jake: Now you're squinting and nodding because you know you should be comprehending something, but you're still not.
jake: And now you're smiling because you think that I think that you understand--
amir:  Are we gonna go the the Dees or not?!
END.
INTRO
amir: THIS IS JAKE AND AMIR! WELCOME TO THE THUNDERSHOW!
jake: Not our intro.
amir: Dangit!
gary: Guys, what's up?  I'm Gary Vay-ner-chuck and Ricky hired me to help you guys explode College Humor's traffic.
amir: Who are YOU?
gary: I said, I'm Gary-
jake:  Okay, you wanna see something impressive.   Who's Ricky?
amir: I know the name.  I know the name.  I just can't put the face to the-
jake: What name?
amir: I don't know the name, I don't know...who are YOU?
gary: Wait wait wait, okay.  Are you guys on Facebook?
jake: Yes     AMIR: No
gary: Twitter?
jake: Yup     AMIR: No
gary: Ustream?
jake: Yes     AMIR: No
gary: Friendster?
jake: No     AMIR: Yes
gary: Are you guys active at all?
amir: Sexually?
jake: We use all those sites.
amir: I'm not active, sexually, or otherwise.
jake: Ok, he's not talking about sex.
gary: Actually, I am.  You know, a healthy lovelife really impacts the workplace.
amir: Me and Jake f**k like rabbits, sir.
gary: Woahhhh
amir: Not each other.
jake: And we don't do that.
gary: Alright guys, here's what we need to do to make CollegeHumor go huge:  You need to hustle, crush it, and go big.
jake: Those all kinda sound like the same thing.
gary: They're not.  Hustle is to crush it.
jake: Wasn't crush it the second thing?
gary: No, that was go big
jake: Then the third thing was...?
gary: Crush it
amir:  Crush it.  See?  This is...now you're speaking my language!
gary: Thank you, comprende.
jake: Comprende?
gary: Jake, the number one thing is to respect your co-worker.  It's family.
amir: It's family.
gary: You guys are friends, right?
amir: Yes, best!
jake: Well, maybe.
gary: Take Amir to a water park, an arcade, a picnic.
amir: I've always said that you should take me to a water park, an arcade, and a picnic.
jake: You have always said that, yeah.
amir: In one day, please.
gary: I-I-I think Amir's cousin, Leron, runs a laser tag in Queens.  Why don't you guys go up there and laser it up?
amir: For once.
jake: How is that gonna help traffic?
amir: You're obsessed with traffic!!
gary: Jake, Amir's right.  Don't worry about the traffic.  Become best friends.  Family.  And it will all work itself out...or not.
jake: So you're saying, it's a good idea for the site if me and Amir go to your favorite clothing store -
jake and amir: Talbots
jake: and uh, we get just matching pajamas.
gary: Dude, now you're getting it.
jake: I am, I think I'm really getting it. Ricky didn't hire you.  Amir hired it.
amir:  He's gone.
jake: No, he's under the table.
amir: No...oh he, no, I can't see him.
jake: Right there.
jake: You're waving him down.
amir: No, I'm not...I'm stretching my wrists.
amir: Where you going?  What about the water park?

jake: Oh! I'm bleeding
amir: Aw yeah,  Come on baby one time!
jake: Hey! Do you mind explaining this?
amir: This? Oh that's  that is a menu to a Thai food restaurant
jake: That's what this is?
amir: Yiiiis
jake: Okay cool. Um, you can actually just say Thai restaurant, you don't have to say Thai food restaurant it accomplishes the exact same thing
amir:  Oh yeah! I guess you're right. Okay, Peace out!
jake:  Peace out!
amir: Peace in the middle ea-
jake: Because I thought what this was was a complete comprehensive list of every single outfit I've ever worn since I started working here
amir: No.
jake: No?
amir: No no, it's not.
jake:  Do you mind if I refer to the first page here?
amir: Yah!
jake: Because here...  The first 'item' on your menu isn't like pad Thai or spring rolls it's December 3rd Jake is wearing blue jeans, yellow belt, grey hoodie and white shoes. With a smiley face, so
amir: Okay, can we backtrack for like, half a second? I have a feeling that you can say Thai Food restaurant, you know what I mean? Yes it does sound a little redundant but I think, like I've heard Leron once-
jake: This is seriously fucking disturbing Amir! I know you're a weirdo. I get that! You're stupid, you're a moron, you're creepy, you're freakishly obsessed with me but this crosses the line. It's seriously fucked, it is. It's 
amir: IT'S IT'S IT'S TODAY JUNIOR!

jake: No I'm gonna get rid of it
amir: DON'T FUCKING TOUCH IT

jake: Bo-Peep, but whatever! Please get off the ledge, your scaring us!
amir:No! You know whats scary? Whats scary is the fact that I'm going to live my entire life as the guy who...wore weird clothes. Womens clothes in that picture....that you put on the fridge.
jake: No one- No one here is going to think of you like that, right guys?
guy 1: Well.... I might...
guy 2: We'll probably remember you as the guy who killed himself.
jake: Look man! I was teasing you as a friend! I was teasing you!
amir: As a friend?
jake: Yeah, a friend.
amir: As a best friend....
jake: Well, as a friend, yeah...HEY HEY HEY, as a BEST FRIEND! A best friend!
amir: This is crazy! Two years ago, if you would have told me-
everyone:No!
intro:
amir: Hi, I'm Arnold Schwarzenegger and you're watching Jake and Amir
jake: You don't really sound like him
amir: Your Terminator
Jake is sitting at his desk while Amir is sitting in a wheel chair between Jake's desk and Sarah's desk. Amir has a sling on his right arm and 2 black eyes. He isn't wearing his glasses.
amir: So the nurse is like  Sorry sir, we can't stay the night with you, even if you are afraid of the dark,  and I'm like Bitch, you ain't going anywhere, there might be ghosts up in here so I grab her  like-
jake: Hey, hey, hey, you don't have to tell me anything you might be embarrassed about.
amir: I'm not embarrassed about anything! So I grab her right  and she finally wrestles loose and she goes to call, I don't know, her supervisor or whatever  but it's complete darkness in there so I start freaking out.
Jake sees Amir going through Sarah's bag
jake:  Hey, hey, get your hand out of Sarah's bag OK? She is right there.
Pan over to Sarah who is sitting at her desk wearing headphones and facing her computer. Pan back to Amir who continues going through the bag.
amir:  What do I care? So you know it's complete darkness in there, I'm crying but it's starting to burn because  my eyes are broken or whatever-
jake: Stay out of Sarah's bag
At this moment Amir pulls a pink tampon out of Sarah's bag. He puts his hands up as if he were surrendering without noticing the tampon in his hand.
amir: OK, relax.  Oh...
Jake closes his eyes then massages his forehead.
jake:  Put that away. Put that away. Put that away.
Amir unwraps the tampon and smells it.
jake: Amir don't.  Do you know what that is? Do you know what it is?
At this point Amir holds the tampon is his mouth. He is moving it around inside his mouth while moaning.
amir: Oh, oh, ahaha!
jake: Sarah! Hey, Sarah.
The camera pans to Sarah again who turns around and sees Amir with the tampon in his mouth.
Amir is now making gargling noises.
Amir appears to be stuffing the tampon down his throat.
The camera cuts to Jake with a confused look on his face.
The camera cuts back to Amir who has closed his mouth on the tampon. The string at the end sticks out of his mouth.
The camera cuts to Sarah who looks at Amir with disgust.
The camera cuts back to Amir.  the tampon is completely inside his mouth now. He swallows. His face which was smiling before, now looks concerned and scared.
jake: Wow, are you ok?
amir:  I'm fine.
jake: Good, so you're not choking or anything?
amir:  Choking? Haha, don't make me laugh. 
jake:  Hahahahahaha, so you don't need the Heimlich?
amir:  Heimlich, what are you crazy? I'm gonna go get lunch , um, do you want anything?
jake:  Nope. I don't.
amir:  I'm going to peace on outta here 
jake: Alright, peace out.
Amir begins to wheel himself away, pushing Jake's chair in the process. Amir seems to be calm while Jake is still freaking out.
amir: But, oh, by the way, before I forget,  what's the name of that song that goes  Come my lady/come come my lady/you're my butterfly.
at the same time:
jake: Sugar-
amir:  I'M GONNA DIE!
Jake quickly gets up while Amir wheezes and struggles to breathe. Jake goes around Amir and begins doing the modified Heimlich maneuver because Amir is in a wheelchair.
Cut to Sarah who looks extra concerned.
Cut back to Jake and Amir. Jake continues to do the Heimlich maneuver until the tampon falls out of Amir's mouth. Amir begins to struggle and cough. The tampon falls to the floor. Amir begins to breathe forcefully, still a little wheezing.
Cut back to Sarah, who is still concerned.
jake:  God, that was close.
Jake pats Amir on the back and ANOTHER tampon falls out of his mouth, then onto the floor. Jake and Sarah exchange confused looks.
amir: By the way it's Sugar Ray's Butterfly is the song.
jake:  That's not true.
amir: Yea, I know it's not.

jake: What?
amir: The pie you requested has been dispensed by me to --
jake: You made me a pie?
amir: No.
jake: Is this why you weren't at work all... Go sit down, you're an idiot. You're a moron. Thanks anyways.

jake: You still haven't used any words.
amir: I'm not an id-eee-eeeeee-
jake: Get it out, come on.
amir: -eeeee.
jake: Are you deflating?
amir: No.
jake: If you're about to cry, which it looks like you are, I'm sorry I called you an idiot, alright?. You just baked or bought me a pie for seemingly no reason and I thought it was as stupid thing to do. You don't need to tick like that, if you have to cry, just let it out. Don't hold it back.
amir: Fi-ugh.
jake: You're fine. So I can say that you're the worst laser tag player ever.
amir: Gu.
jake: And you got good grades like a nerd in high school.
amir: Fugh.
jake: Oh my god, do you see that pillar of smoke behind you? A McDonald's is burning down!
amir: Nerrr.
jake: How about this. Just say a sentence. If you're going to cry, say 'Jake, I'm not going to cry.'

jake: Hey, you're watching Jake and A-
amir: Oh, oh, do one where you're wearing my glasses.
jake: K, no one will be able to know.
amir: I'll be able to know.
amir:  You'll fix everything by just being here.
amir:  So that's about Jake, specifically.
julia nunes: That was...9 minutes long.
amir: Yeah, line, nine, well this next one's double that, so... It's good stuff.
julia nunes: Are you crying?
amir: No, it's just...
amir:  1, 2, aah!, 4,  dirty blond, clean guy, what you got in his eyes, they are blue, so are you, when you're not around son,  oh sheesh, here he is, I cannot contain my ji--, look at him, wearing shirts, eating lots of yogur-
jake: Stop!  What is going on?  Why are you here?
amir: I think you've heard of internet music sensation, Julia Nunes.
jake: Yes, I have, which is why I asked WHY she was here.
amir: Ah, k, I am Amir. So.. do the...when you...
amir: Yeah.
jake: You're still not answering my question.
julia nunes: Amir said that if we recorded some tracks for him, he'd put me in touch with his cousin, Leron, who owns a record label, right?
amir: Yeah, totally.
jake: Pretty sure Leron runs a laser tag.
amir: Jake, a word.  Conference room please.
jake: No.
amir: Okay, fair enough, worth a shot.
jake: God, Amir, you cannot just lie to people to get them to do stuff for you.
amir: Can? or can't?
jake: I specifically said cannot so you wouldn't be confused.
amir: Yeah, that's true, I appreciate that, Jake.  Julia, feeling inspired right now.  Quickly, something slow.
amir:  He's too good to me, knowing what I should be.  Correcting me but in a way that doesn't make me feel dumb.
jake: It should, okay.  Julia, I'm really sorry, but Amir lied to you.
amir: Julia, quick!  Something poppy!
amir:  Jake, be quiet, she doesn't know I lied.  Got her to come to the city, cuz I am so very witty.  My cousin doesn't really own a record label.
jake: Amir, she can understood you when you sing.  It's not like spelling things in front of a  toddler, or you.
amir:  If she could understand what I'm saying, she wouldn't play her mini-guitar while I sing this song, and bam bam ba bam bam
julia nunes: It's a ukelele.
amir: Yes, I've been meaning to talk to you about.  The word ukelele, I don't know if that's gonna fly, just cuz a lot of people can't spell it.
jake: Julia, I'm really sorry.  I'm sure it cost a lot of money to get down to New York.  Amir is going to pay you back.
amir: Yes, I am.  That's true.  I can pay you back in regular old money.   Who needs it?   Or...  I can sing the prettiest song to you...make you feel like a nat-
amir: Twenty, forty, yeah.  This should be more than enough.  You still have to change your mind.  If you want to change your mind, the money's g-
amir: Okay, yes, just the money then, that makes sense.  Because, you can spend money, but the song is-
jake: Just go home, man.
amir: Why would anybody ch-
jake: Just go home.
amir: I'm gonna go home.

jake: Just read the e-mail, Ok, come on.
amir: Ok there. Ok, right off the bat, the first sentence is a cliche, so-
jake:  Wow. I guess it's my fault for asking the least romantic person in the office to help me with an e-mail.  Just delete the first sentence, then

amir: Uh, it's, it's, I mean it's good, it's long, it's really long, like there's two paragraphs here that say the same thing twice, so why don't you just choose one of them?
jake:  Wow, two part question for Amir. When's the last time you got laid, brother? And, uh, number two,  delete the second paragraph.
amir: Second two part question.
jake: Delete- First part was the laid, they were both- Just delete the second paragraph. Alright? It's not hard.
amir: Here, I have a- Ok- maybe, sorry, maybe this is kinda, the whole thing is really intense, maybe you just shouldn't send it. Maybe you should wait until you see her in person. Maybe she's coming to New York, you can tell it to her, to her face.
jake: That's a great idea!
amir: Yeah.
jake: Great idea, that's why you're crawling with women, right? You know what?  Pat! Can you- Can you read this?

jake: What?  Four hundred thousand?  Ok, yeah.  Jamie I love you, I've always loved you.  I couldn't stop thinking about you in high school.  I can't stop thinking about you now.  All I want to do is be with you and if you maybe feel the same way my naked friend over there  is going to fake a seizure and we're going to bust him out of a hospital.  Now I know that sounds cliche but you have two options.  You can come with me to New York and live happy ever after, or you can stay down here in Miami making porn.  Either way just know I've always, always loved you.

amir: W-wait, I have a few video ideas.

jake: Uh, madame is girl. I really- I can just finish this up on my own.
amir: No? What? Nonsense!
amir : Oh my gosh!
amir : I'm blowing up.
jake: Yeah.
amir : I'm blowing up so you better get the party started.
amir : I'm blowing up, I'm blowing. 
jake: Go ahead.
amir: Nie! Nie you! You are over, you understand me? 
amir: Uh.  Hey, I'm gonna have to take off a little bit early today-
jake: Yeah yeah that's fine.
amir: Ok.
amir: I'm Amir and this is Jake and he has got some things to say--
jake: No I don't.
amir: Okay.
amanda: Hey, Will...
will: Yep.
amanda: Did you go to see Valentine's Day this week?
will: Yes.
amanda: So good!
will: It was amazing.
amir: SHHH, guys! Right now just don't say anything, okay? I never ask you for anything, so be quiet. Thank you. Sorry.
will:  So good.
amanda: Julia Roberts? Such a fox. Such a fox!
amir: Would you stop, okay?! You guys are going to blow my spot, okay? I'm trying to do this undercover thing and it's not really working out--
jake:  Yo, man.
amir: No, ma'am... to you. What it is, kid? J. Skrill in the house.
jake: Not much, dude. I'm just super creeped out right now.
amir: Why? What did that-- what did that creep-o Murph do this time?
jake: Oh, not much. Just set up this iChat thing to watch me while I work.
amir:  Ahh! Gross!
jake: Yeah. Only it wasn't Murph. It was you.
amir: Was it? No. You know what? Can-- you know, me and Murph should just switch desks for permanent and then we can discuss this -- instead of over iChat -- in person. Like two civilized ladies... I do declare.
jake: K. Look, I'm not trying to be mean, okay, it's just a fact: Switching desks is not going to happen, okay? Get used to it.
amir: Good! You know what? I'm happy because I am getting used to it. I'm getting used to working with people that like me, okay? God forbid I work with my friends for once, huh? You know, you're just jealous. Aren't you? AREN'T YOU?! AREN'T YOU?!!
marena: Shut up! Okay?! I mean, we've been trying to ignore you but that's clearly not working. The fact is: Nobody here likes you. We hate you! You groped Amanda. You ripped my shirt. I don't know why or how you still have a job, but please just be quiet and leave us alone. Please.
amir:  Hey, um, sorry, uh, you couldn't hear or see that but what happened was I did a backflip and people were so impressed, they applauded me.
jake: You were covering the lens, not the microphone.
amir: Was it? Yeah. So, you missed my backflip then?
amir: Uh, so Murph just--
jake: Murph just walked into Ricky's office and he said, Hey, I need to switch desks. I guess he had some friends over at the Busted Tees area that he missed.
amir: I guess it's kinda like a blessing in disguise 'cause as much as I liked those guys and they liked me, sometimes they were getting on my nerves a little, so... I don't know. This might be better in the long run, 'cause--
jake:  I know.
amir: Yeah.
amir: Hey. Dinner tonight?
jake: No.
murph: Hey, what's up best work station ever?

EPISODE
amir: Snowstorms right? I remember as a kid, I used to play outside during a snowstorm on my front lawn, trying to spell S.O.S with my tracks. I don't know why. What was I trying to be saved from? Those were the best days of my life.
jake: Ricky said you threw hot coffee in Rosie's face this morning.
amir: When it's this much, you can't even tell if it's falling down or going up-
jake: On purpose.
amir: Everywhere, it's white on white, it's pure, it's beautiful. There is no direction, it just, is.
jake: It's definitely going down, they said you just like walked up, didn't say anything, you just threw the hot coffee in his face. Did you?
amir: It's funny how winter kind of sneaks up on you, you know? Every year I'm surprised again for the first time.
jake: Sarah tried to help him and you picked her up by the neck and threw her to the ground.
amir: I guess life is about being spontaneous.
jake: I don't know if you're listening to me, but you're probably going to go to jail for this. The very least you'll be arrested, I think the police are on their way.
amir: Look how beautiful it is outside. I'm already in jail.
jake: So you are hearing me, ok. This is the second time you've really hurt Rosie.
amir: In a couple of years we're going to look back on this day and realize, this was the day that the cops came and I hid behind the copy machine and you covered for me even though you didn't want to.
jake: Ok, so now I see where you were going with all that. I'm not going to do that though.
amir: It was our word against Rosie's. He didn't stand a chance. Our friendship was solidified by the risk you were willing to take for me.
jake: This is some seriously depraved shit man, and I'm not covering for you.
amir: You said you weren't going to cover for me but deep down inside, you knew that you had to.
jake: Don't talk about deep down inside me, ok.
amir: At the end of the day, I had some shit on you that the police couldn't find out about and if they did, you'd be the one sitting next to me in that jail cell.
jake: Yeah right, what?
amir: March 15, 1999 you-
jake: Ok, fine fine. Go hide, go hide.
amir: 
jake: Snow, huh. If it were any color other than white, it wouldn't be as beautiful.

 Will everyone please join us for a moment of silence for Kunal Shar, a Collegehumor employee who was killed last night.
amir singing loudly: Shawty's like a melody in my head that I can't keep out, got me singing like na na na na everyday, it's like ipod's stuck on replay. No way, no way-way-way-way-way-way-way-way.
Jake shooshing him through out his singing
amir: Sorry, this is super loud, which makes me talk super loud cause you can't hear the sound of your own voice. Have you ever noticed that, it's like everytime-
jake, whispering: We're having a moment of silence
amir: Who died? Amir laughs
jake: Kunal
amir: Really? Erh. My bad.
Amir cracks fingers, turns laptop on, laptop makes a loud sound. Amir mouths sorry and turns volume of laptop down.
jake, whispering: There's one button that mutes everything
Amir signs that he wants to do a farting noise with his hands
jake, whispering: Why now?
Amir finds packet of MMs in pocket, bangs it his thigh before trying to open it and bangs it on his thigh again and gets it open this time.
amir, whispering: MM?
jake mouths: I don't want one.
Amir pours the bag of MMs on his desk
amir, whispering: I like the blue ones
Amir throws the MM into the air to try to catch it in his mouth, but it lands and hits his tooth.
Pause
amir, yelling: Ow!
jake, whispering: You don't have to say ow
amir, normal voice: Ok, obviously I wouldn't say anything unless it really really hurt, alright. You know me man, you know I keep silent unless it kills, but it really hurts.
jake, whispering: Just please!
amir, normal voice: Ok, you know what? How about you smile and I'll throw one of these pebbles in your mouth, we'll see how you like it, ok?
jake, whispering: I'm asking for 10 seconds
Amir throws MM into Jake's eye
amir, normal voice: Ooh see! Oh wait no, you can't because I threw one of the pebbles in your eyes and now you can't and you won't shut up about it. But when I do it I'm a huge dill-weed, so how's that fair? Huh?

 Amir: Hey Craig, you're watching Jake and Amir.
jake: Craig?
amir: Yeah, and people who are not named Craig.
amir: Jake. I figured out a way to save time.
jake: By not talking during work?
amir: By wiping before you shit?
jake: How does that save you any time?
amir: How does what save you any time?
jake:  I made a promise to myself that I wasn't going to get mad at you anymore, because it only stresses me out and it seems to have no effect on you. So...
amir:  How does what save you any time, though? How does what,  save you any time, that is.
jake: How does wiping before you shit save you any time?
amir: It does.
jake: I would like to know how.
amir: And I'm telling you that it is, a time saver.
jake: I believe you that you believe it's a time saver.
amir: And I believe you, that you believe me, that is, because it is.
jake: Ok, but just tell me how it saves time.
amir: Ya just do it! You wipe, and then you shit.
jake: You're just explaining that you do it.  But you're not saying why it saves time.
amir: You don't have to because it does.
jake: Ok!
amir: Ok!
jake: That's fine!
amir: Hm hm!
jake: Good!
amir:  Yeah!
jake: All right.
amir:  Yep!
jake: I don't think it saves anytime but, we can agree to disagree.
amir:  We can agree to agree because it does! AHH!
jake: We don't have to agree on everything and that's fine.
amir:  It is fine, because it does.
jake: You are wrong sometimes.
amir: I am never wrong sometimes.
jake: Because this doesn't change the two things that you have to do which is shit and wipe. It just switches the order. Maybe if you didn't wipe at all, but...
amir: Yes but if you switch the order it makes it so time is saved so, ahh! 
jake: You don't switch the order of things and save time.
amir:  Yes I do.
jake: But, OK.
amir: Ok
jake: Ok
amir: It is Ok because it does save time.
jake: It doesn't save time.
amir:  It is ok because it does save time, It is ok because it does save time.
jake:  Boop boop bedoop, It doesn't save time.
amir:  Yes it does, Yes it does.
jake:  Well, whatever. That's a bad song anyway. Ok.
amir:  Yes it does it does save time, yes it does it does save time.  Yes it does it does save TIME!
jake:  I'm going to kill you!
amir: AHHH
jake:  HOW IS IT A TIME SAVER? YOU'RE STILL WIPING, YOU'RE STILL SHITTING. YOU'RE STILL DOING BOTH THINGS.
amir: I can't breathe!
jake: EXPLAIN IT TO ME. EXPLAIN IT.
amir: LET GO! All I'm saying is that if you wipe before you shit there's not a lot of shit there so you don't have to wipe as much! That's it! It's a time saver!
jake: That's it?
amir: That's it, yeah.
jake: That's really unsanitary. But I can see how you might say that's a time saver.
amir: Because it saves time.
jake: It still doesn't make any sense but, I can see your logic.
amir:  What doesn't make sense?
jake: I'll kill you.
amir: GAHHH
jake: Hey everybody! This is Jake, and you're watching Jake and Amir.
amir: Wow, you are trying way too hard.
jake: Okay.
amir: Now, question, and it's an important one so think wisely
jake: Oh, damn it! Damn it. My computer crashed. I had a script on there, and I didn't save it.
amir:  That sucks... Right?
jake: Yeah. Thank you.
amir: Sucks so hard. ...Doesn't it? ..Sucks so badly, doesn't it?
jake: It's fine.
amir: ...Sucks so bad and hard
jake: Can you...
amir: I'm not gonna sit here and tell you that it doesn't suck, okay?
jake: Yeah, I agreed.. with you that it sucks, okay? Let's move on.
amir: I'm not gonna sit here and watch you cry about it, 'cause that's not gonna help
jake: I'm not crying. I'm not crying.
amir: Yeah, you're not crying yet, but once the tears flow, how is that gonna save everything?
jake: It'sIt would
amir: TellTell me how the tears will help , and I'll let you flow I'll let them flow out.. onto my shoulder.
jake: TheyFine. Tears would not help them out
amir:  Oh my god, my filesI left my files home; it was so important
jake: Wow, this wouldn't even be nice if I were upset.
amir:  Oh, but now my day's ruined, and I have to eat cat food, and I don't know what to do because I don't like the dry ones, it's too crisy, and the wet ones are too soggy so I have to mix it together, but it still tastes too salty to eat.  WHY?!  Oh, damn it...
jake: You eat cat food?
amir: Uh, yeah. Of course.  Look at me.  Look at me. Hey! Look at me. Look at me.
jake: Wow! This is great; it was on AutoSave.
amir: Things are gonna be fine, okay?
jake: Yeah! I got the file back.
amir: Okay. If this is the worst thing that happened to you today... 
jake: It's not.
amir: Guess what? You have a very blessed life.
jake: Thank you.
amir: 'Cause that means you're not gonna die today. ...So, pretty good
jake: I'm gonna get back to work.
amir: Okay.

jake: A is for aura. Young and strong. U is for umbrella-
amir : Wow, umbrella?

jake: Spaghetti, but that doesn't start with an R, alright?
amir: Yeah, that's close enough. I'm sure she'd appreciate that.
jake: R is for raising me. A gift that you continued to give me throughout my childhood. A is for arms-

amir: I think she has two, but-

Don't get puzzled. Get even.
intro:
amir: For all of us here at Jake and Amir, happy holidays
jake: Wow, not even close.
amir: Whateva
episode:
amir: UHHHHHH what book are you reading?
jake: It's a newspaper.
amir: No shit, that's why I asked what you were reading.
jake: Okay, what?
amir: Okay what?
jake: I was reading about this oil spill.
amir: Tell me about it. No news is good new though.
jake: Well there is news and its bad news.
amir: Yeah that's why... It proves my point.
jake: I hate when you're accidentally right.
jake: Basically there was an accident and there is a well pumping hundreds of thousands of gallons of oil into the ocean every single day.
amir: What's the big deal, just stuff it with garbage, that's what I would do.
jake: Wow they actually thought of that and it's insanely disappointing that you're coming up with the same solutions as they are.
amir: Yeah... disappointing for me? Err...
jake: For the world.
amir: For the wolf.
jake: For the world.
amir: I think the scariest thing isn't the rate at which the oil is spilling but rather spiders! Okay those things are freaky for real.
jake: Yeah.
amir: "Yeah" you agree or "Yeah" you're just getting me to shut up?
amir: If you could change one thing about the oil spill what would it be...
jake: The rig would never explode
amir: ...and why? Hmm, little harder than you thought.
amir: Soil, foil, Susan Boyle.
jake: Can you go back to your desk?
amir: Noil
amir: Drill baby drill huh, more like kill baby krill.
jake: That's actually kind of clever.
amir: If only krill was a word.
jake: Okay never mind.
amir: Yeah forget it. Forget it, it's got it, it's gone.
jake: Yup.
amir: There's this episode of Saved by the Bell where uh...
jake: With the oil spill?
amir: No the one where Zach impersonates a Russian chess player from Valley and let's Screech beat him.
jake: Why would you bring that up now?
amir: Cuz it's funny!
amir: As sad as this whole oil spill thing is, it might be like the one catalyst that sort of springs us and the world in general to sort of think about alternative energy sources going forward.
jake: You might be right, you might be right.
amir: Yeah... I'm just KIDDING you idiot! Haha you Carfucker I got you! Yeah how about an automobile that runs on ocean water so that when the ocean water spills into the ocean nobody gives a crap? How about...
amir: You know this whole thing wouldn't be an issue if oil was more dense than water, like I suggested!
amir: Ah no no no kay kay kay, here we go. How about an automobile that's run on stupid ideas so we can just hook a pump to your ass and you can fart out these shitty ill-conceived notions for the rest of time and we can just power every car in America for the next thirty years. How 'bout that! Or, what about, thinking solar for once.

INTRO Jake - Hey, you're watching Jake and Am--
Amir - Let me guess!
Jake - Jake and Amir.
Amir - LET ME GUESS!
amir: Hey, thanks for coming.
jake: No problem, man.  I'll go to a Yankee game anytime.  Hey, speed up a little bit, you're going like 8 miles per hour.
amir: Yeah, what's the speed limit?
jake: It's 65.
amir: OK, I got a little wiggle room.
jake: How'd you get the tickets, by the way?
amir: Well they were super cheap. I guess no one wants to see the Reds play.
jake: Why not, dude? It's inter-league play, at Yankee Stadium, it's pretty cool.
amir:  Not quite at Yankee Stadium, the game is in Cincinnati.
jake: All right, pull over.
amir: Da-nati.
jake: Pull over, man.
amir: The nati, shasta macnati. What's up?
jake: I said pull over, all right? I don't want to go to Cincinnati.
amir: We're almost there, relax!
jake: We are not almost there, we just left, OK? And the game is in two hours, we're going to miss it.
amir: We're not - . The game is not in two hours, check the date, it's in 26 hours, idiot. OK, so we're barely going to miss it.
jake: But we're still missing the game.
amir: Yeah, a little bit, but what's the big deal when you got  the Overbeck Pottery Museum!
jake: Doesn't sound like it's in Cincinnati, it sounds like it's in Overbeck.
amir: Yeah, well you're wrong, again, because it's not in either; it's in Cambridge City, Indiana, which sounds far away but it's actually only a six hour drive from Cincinnati, which means road trip #2!
jake: OK, well I don't want to go on road trip number one, so just please pull over.
amir: That's fine. You're just being a little bit of a buzz kill right now but what you need is a high level of the tickle monster! 
jake: OK, pull--Watch the road! Watch the road!
amir:  Oh my god!
jake:  Geez! You're going to kill both of us.  You're going to kill us.  Let me drive.
amir: N-n-n-n-no. I know what you're trying to do, you're trying to get me to let go of the steering wheel. It's not  gonna happen, OK? I don't trust you.
jake:  I know a short cut.
amir: Do you? OK, let's stop right here then.
amir:  But I hope you realize that this move, this little switch, makes me the DJ of this party-mobile. That's right, all party tunes, all the time. Me and you, haha, OK, uh...
amir:  J.K., it's me, uh,  you're an idiot. Look to your right, man.  You are going to realize that I am not there. 
Mom, it's me, yeah, uh, I'm kind of stranded.
Jake, you are going to be such an idiot when you look and realize I'm not there anymore.  Come back, all right? Or call me, buh-bye.  Pick up. Pick up. Pick up. J.K. It's me, uh . . .

intro:
amir: Hey, you're watching Goodwill Hunting, starring Denzel Washington.
jake: Wow, you are so wrong.
jake: Hey.
jake: Hey!
amir: AAAaaahhhwwwwazzaapp?
jake: Not too much, you fell asleep while you were taking a s***.
amir:  Nah. I'm good.
jake: Well you were on the toilet, and you were sleeping, so.
amir: So yeah, I can see why you'd think that, based on all this .
jake: Why is the door open?
amir: Door is open because I um... ... Alright FINE I was asleep, ok you caught me!
jake: Yeah I know you were asleep, but thank you for being honest on your second try; doesn't explain the door.
amir: Jake, ok, I'm sorry, it's too early for this.
jake: It's four in the afternoon.
amir: Yes, well the door is open because I fell asleep before I got a chance to close it, ok?
jake: Ok, yeah, closing it should be the first thing you do, though.
amir: Yeah, it was going to be, but I  zonked out.
jake: Ya zonked out, well you had time to take your pants off, so I know you're lying.
amir:  Ya caught me again. You BASTARD! Hahaha, you're on today! 
jake: Don't.. try to touch me. It's not even that I'm mad. It's just that we were about to start a meeting, you excused yourself, you said I'll be back in one second, and I asked you where you were going, and you said I'm going to get everybody treats.
amir: Oh, no, the treats.
jake: Nonono, don't.. worry about that. It's just, Ricky said that he didn't think it was such a good idea, and then you winked at him , and you said  trust me, when I get back with these treats, it's gonna be a good idea,  and then he said Trust me, it's not, and then you said I will be back in thirty seconds, forty-five tops , the treats are on my desk, I just forgot to bring them to the meeting. And that was forty-five minutes ago.
amir: Yes, that's because it's better to ask for forgiveness, than for permission.
jake: Well you already asked for permission and he said no, so now you have to ask for both.
amir: Ok. Just wipe me and we can go, please.
jake: Sure, do you want me to wet the toilet paper?--
amir: Yes, please wet the toilet paper--
jake: Are you f***ing crazy, you think I'm gonna wipe you?

SARAH, JAKE and PAT are sitting on a couch, laughing and smiling. PAT is holding a picture in his hands.
pat: Yes-- so, I-- I used to be a little fat.
jake:  A little fat? C'mon man, you're a blimp in this picture. There's nothing little about it.

Everyone laughs, except PAT.
amir: Hey, I'd give Pat a candy bar but he'd just eat it!  ..No, I'm just messin' with you guys. 
jake: Well, I'm gonna go back to w--
amir: Ww- Pat! I saw Pat eating a sandwich yesterday. Lettuce, cheese, tomato-- everything. And what he didn't finish, he just threw away.  What's the matter Pat, ain't you ever heard of leftovers for dinner? 
sarah : Are you calling him fat or wasteful?
amir: Whatever, it's all the same, right, tubby?
sarah: Are you calling *me* fat?
amir: ..No.
amir : Hey Pat, I'd give you a gift certificate to a restaurant,  but he'd probably just spend it! 
pat: ..Yeah..
amir: At the restaurant, maybe. 
pat: ..I would.
amir: Oh my god, this guy's too fat to even realize he's admitting it!  Pat farted!  No...
jake: Wow, that was really bad.

pat: Yeah, well you're really bad at it.
amir: No.
sarah: Yeah seriously Amir, don't make fun of me, I don't want anyone to know I had food for breakfast.
Everyone laughs.
amir : Yeah well at least my little brother didn't die!
Everyone stops laughing.
pat:  Ahm..
amir: ..So.
Several more seconds of silence pass.
amir:  Um. Um. No... So.
PAT pats JAKE's leg and stands up. He pats Amir on the shoulder before walking away.
pat : Fine. It's funny man. Really funny.
amir: C'mon! I was messing with him!
jake: Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir.
amir: Wow, you're so good. Why don't you just do all the intros without me?
jake: Fine.
amir: NO!
jake: Wow, you are still playing with that toy.
amir: Uh, it's not a toy; it's a 3D puzzle game. Yeah...
jake:  It's not a toy; it's a 3D puzzle game, meah MEAH! You know what you sound like, man? Heh... Show me how to solve it.
amir: Show you?
jake: Just show me how to solve it.
amir: Oh, teach you how to solve the cube?
jake: No, no, no, what could you possibly teach me?
amir: Uh... how to.. solve it.
jake: Okay, well then why aren't you doing it?
amir: Um... I will. Okay, so basically, it's simple. The first step is
jake: Amir, Amir, I know it's simple. Otherwise, you wouldn't be able to do it. 
amir: Right. I guess so. Uh, you don't know how to do it, though, so...
jake: Why don't you teach me how to do it; then I'll show you how well I can do it, a LOT weller than you could ever do it.
amir: Weller. Okay, uh, so the first step is to do the entire front face the same, so right now
jake: And then all the other steps are getting all of the other blocks the same, right? Why don't you not tell me WHAT to do, but tell me HOW to do it? How! Now!
amir: Okay ... uh, yeah. So, well, then it's not called blocks; it's called cubes.
jake: Okay, cool. You're gonna treat me like a baby, then I'mma leave.
jake: And you're not even gonna try to stop me. WOW, you're the worst teacher ever, and yet I'm still able to learn from you. ...And I will master the art.
amir: Uh... right, so, uh, there are algorithms in play, so you wanna
jake: I know what algorithms are.
amir: I didn't say you didn't know what algorithms were.
jake: Well, what are they?
amir: Um, they're ways to move the cube so that you don't mess up what you already have, so right now
jake: I was the first kid in my grade to be able to solve one of these actually, y'know that? And then, I was like, Oh, there's a lot more important things to worry about, like getting laid! So I became the master of that.
amir: ...Right. So this one's called Right Inverted, Down Inverted, Right, Down.
jake: I'm gonna beat you right down, if you don't slow down, right now, okay? All of that went right over my head.
amir: Right, well, we're getting close, so just pay attention.
jake: How random would it be if I just punched you in the head right now?
jake: Right, directly, in the skull. Knocked out your lights.
amir: Whoa.
jake: Scared? Scared? Who has the upper hand? 'Cause you know what, kid? There are book smarts, and there are street smarts. And I got both; you got neith
amir: Done! Hehe.
jake: Wow, that took you, like, four hours. Congratulations, that was amazing. Thethe slowest solving of the Rubik's Cube ever!
jake: Wow, check it out! I gotyo, I solved the cube! Everybody!
jake: Very funny; who locked the door?
jake: I might run out of air in here!
jake:  Oh no! I'm gonna die!   No, I'm not, 'cause I have a cell phone, and I'll text someone to come let me out!

Paying people back is a bitch
INTRO Amir - All right. New rules.  I'll introduce the videos, if and only if--
Jake - Time's up.
Amir - Dang it.
amir: Babe .  .  .  baaaabe.
jake: I really hope you're not talking to me.
amir: I'm not.  Did you get the letter I sent you, babe?
jake: I didn't. Did you send me a letter?
amir: I did. I did send you a letter, and let me know when you get it because there's a couple things that I want to clarify.  Firstly, in the opening paragraph--
jake: I said I didn't get the letter.
amir: OK, just let me know when you do because I left some things intentionally ambiguous.
jake: Why would you intentionally leave things ambiguous?
amir: So that I could clarify them later. Oooh!
jake: OK, well I'll let you know.
amir: Please do. Please do-do.  Please do-do, but not in my tea, or in my coffee! Haha, no.
jake: Where'd you send it? Where'd you send the letter? What name and address did you put on it?  Cool, so I'm not going to get the letter.
amir: Oh. You'll get the letter.
jake: I'm not going to get the letter, not if you didn't put a name and address on the envelope.
amir: OK, I don't want to argue with you anymore about this stupid letter!
jake: OK, you shouldn't.
amir: OK, you're going to get it, and we're going to laugh. And we're going to laugh and we're going to crack up when you read it.
jake: Even if I did get the letter--
amir: Which you will.
jake: --I don't think I'd laugh about it. I definitely wouldn't crack up.
amir: OK, forget it. I'm going to change the subject.  What do you think is in the letter?
jake: How is that changing the subject?
amir:  Because before we were talking about whether or not you would get it and now we're talking about the contents of the letter.
jake: Still sounds like we're talking about the letter.
amir: Yeah, well I'm not going to not talk about the letter, I want to talk about the letter!
jake: OK, you know what? I got the letter.  I got the letter and it's at home and I'll read it and we'll talk about it tomorrow.
amir: You didn't get the letter.
jake: How do you know that?
amir: Because I never sent a letter!
jake: Oh my god!
amir: You placate me too often.  I address that in the letter.   Somewhat ambiguously, but I would clarify it later.  Any odds you already got it?

amir: Alright, cut.
amir: Longest holding-of-breath, attempt number one.
jake: It's attempt number two.
amir: Just-- okay. It's just a little more impressive if I do it in one! Right? It's so obvious that that's what I was tr--
amir: Attempt number one.
amir: What the hell was that?
jake: You're clearly cheating.
amir: You're a f**king narc.
amir: Okay, attempt number one.
jake: They can see that.
amir: Because you said something!
amir: So... cut.  Which one?
jake: That.
amir: Okay, attempt number one.
jake: God, that's worse than before. Cut.
amir: Rrrrgh.
jake: Alright: what are you doing?
amir: We can always ed--... th-- edit that part out.
jake: Why edit? Why cheat? Why are you trying to cheat?
amir: Because I'm trying to-- make it impressive; I wanna get in the Book.
jake: Okay, let's just do one honest attempt. Okay? No cheating.
amir: ...Okay. No cheating.
jake: No cheating.
amir: Start.
jake: Ready?
jake: Oh my God!

jake: Seventeen minutes! That's amazing!
amir:  Gahhhhhhh...
jake: Oh my God!

INTRO Amir - Hey, you are watching a web show.
Jake - Which web show?
Amir - None of their business.
amir: Check your e-mail.
jake: You're on a typewriter.
amir: Check it again then.
jake: I didn't check it the first time.
amir: Huh, my e-mail always gets sent after just one line.
jake: Oh.
amir: Any ideas on how to fix that?
jake: You think the ding is like a sending noise.
amir: Don't I know it. Pay to play.
jake: That's not plugged into anything, so how is it going to send an e-mail?
amir: So laptops aren't plugged into anything, and they send e-mails quite fine.
jake: That's not a good argument.
amir: Oh my god, everyone, your laptops aren't plugged into anything, I hope wireless routers exist and can send packets of information over the airwaves using I-triple E 802.11 technology standards.  Or is that impopsicle?
jake: Impopsicle?
amir: Impopsicle. It's frozen. How stupid you are.
jake: You're an idiot.
amir: You're an asshole! You're mean to me!  Check your e-mail!
jake: I didn't get an e-mail from you, OK? Why don't you just tell me what it said?
amir: If you have to ask . . . then you don't know.
jake: That's how that works. Yeah, I ask because I don't know.
amir: It's just this e-mail, congratulating you for being you. So.
jake: All right.
amir: Now I wish I never sent it.
jake: You didn't ever send it.
amir: Well now I feel like a stupid because the e-mail is in the aether and it just never arrived to you.
jake: It's not in an aether, never made it to the aether, all right?
amir: And now maybe because this stupid fight, you're not going to send me an e-mail congratulating me for being such an awesome person. But maybe I'm just overanalyzing it and you might.
jake: Nope! You're not overanalyzing it. I'm not going to send you an e-mail.
amir: Is it because you're going to feel like a dill-weed because I called you out on it and you wanted that e-mail to surprise me? Because I can tell you that I can act surprised.  In fact, the fact that I'm doubting you will make me actually surprised.  It's kind of ironic, right? Kind of one of life's little beautiful moments.  Don't you love life like that? These little moments that are sort of indescribable except for the two people that are experiencing it at the same --
jake: OK, I just sent you an e-mail.
amir: Oh.  I don't even know how to check it on this gay thing though.
THE END.

jake: I guess.
amir: Isn't it weird that worms are cannibals?
jake: They're not.
amir: They eat humans.
jake: That's not cannibalism, cannibalism is when you eat your own species.
amir: So you're saying worms don't eat other worms.
jake: I'm saying I don't know, but either way that's not what you meant.
amir: Isn't it?
jake: I feel like I've had this conversation with you before.

jake: Oblivious?
amir: Look who decided to show up, ladies and Germanies!
jake: Where'd you meet her?
amir: What's with the third degree? Can't somebody have a private life? At a laser tag. Read between the lines.

lerona: What's your favorite one?
jake: Um, wow that's hard. Oh wait no, it's not. It's The Two Towers. Remember when they're in the fields of Rohan and Eomer finds them
and he's gonna chop off Gimli's head and then Legolas draws his bow and he's all like,
in unison: You would die before your sword/stroke fell.
jake: Stroke, not sword, but that was close. Wow that's so cool that you know it. Hey, can I ask you a question?
lerona: Ugh, I know what you're gonna ask me.
jake: You do?
lerona: And, I mean, I know Amir's not the smartest guy, but he's really genuine. That's what I like about him, he's just not about
just sex, you know?
jake: I was just gonna ask you why a girl as pretty as you is into Lord of the Rings.
lerona: Oh. Can I ask you a question?
jake: Yeah.
lerona: Will you promise not to tell Amir I said he wasn't the smartest guy?
lerona: Thanks.

lerona:  No...
amir: Anyway, shall we go to lunch, madar?
jake: What's madar? Is that where you're going to?
lerona: He meant madam.
jake: I know.
lerona: Do you call him out like that all the time?
amir: Yes. And I wouldn't have it any other way.
jake: Great I'm impressing the wrong person.
amir: Off we go. Peace in the Ittle East! Peace in the Italy.
jake: Italy, right.
jake: I see in your eyes the same fear that would take the heart of me.
jake: The day may come when the courage of men fails. When we forsake our friends and break all bonds of fellowship. But that is not?
lerona: Sorry, forgot my sunglasses.
jake: Yeah.
lerona: Don't be embarrassed. That was cute.
jake:  Thank you.
amir: Hey babe, I'm gonna be in the bathroom. Gotta drop a major two-bomb. Jake don't wait up.

INTRO
jake: Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir.
amir: Let go of me!

Jake and Amir are walking side by side.
amir: What was the last thing you said to her?
jake: I don't remember.
amir: I'm sorry.
jake: Thanks.
amir: You're just gonna let me feel like this is my fault?
jake: What?
amir: I said, I'm sorry, and you said, Thanks. Like I'm apologizing? Like, I didn't do anything.
jake: Okay. I can't have this conversation with you right now.
amir: Although, who has two thumbs and should be apologizing for not doing anything? This guy.  No, I'm just kidding. You tried to push her out of the way when the bus hit her though, right?
jake: Look, it happened really, really fast, alright?
amir: Yeah, really, really fast. From your girlfriend to dead in two minutes flat. It's a world record. Hazzah!
jake: Jesus Christ man, we just buried her.
amir: Yeah. This is my way of coping with things, okay? Trust me, I'm hurting more than you are.
jake: I seriously doubt that.
They stop walking.
amir: Wait, you think you're sadder than I am?
jake: No, I know I'm sadder than you are.
amir: Ha!
jake: See, you're laughing.

Amir points at Jake.
jake: Okay, fair enough but we we're about to begin something new and amazing and it all got cut short.

They briefly push each other then stop.
amir: It's crazy, huh?
jake: What is?
amir: One minute, you're here. The next, worm food.
jake: Yeah, I guess.
amir: Isn't it weird that worms are cannibals?
jake: They're not.
amir: They eat humans.

amir: So you're saying worms don't eat other worms?
jake: I'm saying I don't know, but either way that's not what you meant.
amir: Isn't it?
jake: I feel like I've had this conversation with you before.

Episode
amir: Hey.
jake: Yeah.
amir: You're my best friend, right?
jake: What?
amir: Yesterday, people were just talking smack about me. Saying that I was obsessed with you and that you didn't care about me and
that's it's pathetic and stupid and that you weren't my best friend. But you are, right? You're my best friend?
jake: You shouldn't let talk to you like that.
amir: I know. But, at the end of the day, they're wrong, right? You're my best friend?
jake: They're wrong...
amir: Yeah.
jake: ...to make fun of you.
amir: Yeah, well they're wrong about that for sure, but they're also wrong about another thing, about you not being my best fr
jake: Who's making fun of you?
amir: Everybody. Are you my best friend?
jake: I have a lot of best friends.
amir: Mhm. Including me?
jake: It'sum... I'm getting a call.  Hello?
amir:  Hey it's me, are we best friends?
jake: You know what? Maybe it's the shirts, man. You gotta stop making those shirts.
amir: What are you talking about? This is the only one I made in this style.
jake: But all the other ones, with our faces and our names.
amir: This one is just faces, no names.
jake: Okay, but it's all the same thing, and it's weird, alright? I don't know if you're making any money off of them
amir: I'm not, I'm losing money.
jake: Well that's also weird.
amir: Technically we're losing money.
jake: How am I losing money?
amir: I made a promise on our behalf to Busted Tees that these would sell like pancakes.
jake: You mean hotcakes.
amir:  Not that well. Are you or are you not my best friend?
jake: I would say, number one, don't worry about what other people think
amir: Uh huh.
jake: and two, as far as the shirts go
amir: Stop thinking about the shirts, okay? Pretend I'm wearing any other shirt about us.
amir: Oh my gosh. They're right.
jake: Look
amir: There's nothing I can do but try to reverse what has already happened. To make every day a small step in a big mission to win you
over deed by deed!
jake: I'm your best friend!
amir: And the shirts?
jake: They're great. I think Busted Tees is gonna sell a lot of them.
amir: Good. Nobody was making fun of me. I just didn't want to guilt you into saying something you didn't mean.
jake: What do you think you just did?
amir: That's water under the bridge. Now! How many of these  can I put you down for? 16? 64? We're pretty much way
in the red after those first few t-shirt debacles, and we're looking to rebound in a major way and I'm counting on you best friend!
 Hi. I'm Amir, and this episode of Jake and Amir kinda revolves around-
 Do you think we're doing commentary?
 I did, yes
 Question!
 Yeah. And I have one for you after
 Okay, you go first. Mine's a little bit.. involved
 Why is your hand in a mouse trap?
 Human cheese trap, okay, and, can you go to jail for-
 There's no such thing as a human cheese trap, but go on. Can you go to jail for what?
 It is a human cheese trap, okay, and you know you're not supposed to go into apartments that technically aren't yours?
 Yes, it's called breaking and entering. Also, just because you got caught in the mouse trap doesn't make it a human trap
 I'm a human, got caught in it, hence: human trap. Okay? And I wasn't breaking anything, alright? Their window was open-ish
 What do you mean by open-ish? Also, it wasn't made to catch humans
 Well, I'm not a mouse and I got caught in it quite easily. So riddle me that, Bat Mat! And it was kind of locked, but I cracked it sort of open
 Okay so it sounds like you broke the window. And I know you're not a mouse, you just got caught in one of their traps
 You think a mouse laid this out to catch me? Okay, it wasn't even in my apartment. Which brings me to my question
 Fine, I give up
 I give up too
 Oh boy, that's a glue trap
 Not a glue trap, okay, a glue pad. There's a difference
 Yes, the difference being that glue traps are real, glue pads are not. Was there even cheese on that?
 No, not cheese, there were these small little peculiar brown pellets which I'm sure they used to lure me in. They were kind of small like Rye seeds, it smelled like mouse shit
 It was mouse shit
 Well good thing I didn't eat most of them, Sherlock
 But you ate some of them
 Alright, let me ask you this: if somebody offers you chocolate, do you take it?
 I don't think anyone was offering you chocolate
 Okay, so you don't think I have a case against these A-holes who lured me into their house and hurt me?
 It sounds like you just broke into an apartment and ate mouse shit off a glue trap
 Huh, and you sound like their lawyer. Good day sir!
 Ugh! It's on your D-
amir: Hey, you're watching JAAake--  Sorry.
jake: Wow.
amir: Please delete this one. I'm begging you.
both: I know what you're doing.
That was just a coincidence!
You're clearly beginning to talk after I do!
I'm a huge nerd.
amir: No I'm not.
amir: You're a jerk!
jake: What are you doing? Sit there! Amir! Sit there! We have an entire couch, and I'm not gonna move because I was
amir:  Hey can you help a cousin out with his resume?
jake: Wow, actually, yes, absolutely. Are you looking for another job?
amir: Something like that.
jake: Alright, right off the bat, you've used a sample resume I'm guessing, because your name is Will B. Hired.
amir: You caught that.
jake: Yes, I did. And your email address is put@emailaddress.here.
amir: Okay, can we please just focus on what matters?
jake: Objective, wow. Why don't you read this out loud and tell me if it's what you want to send to a prospective employer.
amir: Money = pussy. No.
amir: You want a hurtsdangit?
jake: What?
amir: Hurts!
amir: Dang it!
jake: Under Experiences you just wrote When something happens to you; that's just defining it.
amir: Mhm. Did I get it right, though?
jake: It doesn't matter.
amir: That's a yes.
jake: Under Skills you wrote dunking.
amir: Mhm. A basketball.
jake: Yeah, no, I know, but you can't do that.
amir: Yeah, did I specify how tall the hoop was?
jake: You did, you said 10 feet.
amir: Okay so delete it. It's not rocket sockets.
jake: I know but it's still--
amir: Just get out of my life!
jake: Yeah, this, like, all this, where you listed every school, even the ones you went to when you were a baby, that's just un-- are you asleep? Are you asleep?
amir: Hnh? Yeah! No.
jake: Proficient at Microsoft Word, right? You said you can write 500 words a minute?
amir: Mhm. But, did I specify what kind of words?
jake: You did; you're always specifying for some reason. You wrote nonsense words, and a winking emoticon.
jake: Activities, you wrote none, which is honest, but it's probably a bad move.
amir: Yeah, well, I didn't wanna lie.
jake: Yeah but then there's a comma and you wrote music.
amir: Right, well you gotta sweeten the deal a little bit. Right? You gotta tickle the generals. 
jake: Still, I feel like--
amir: --a little bit. So, just stop focusing on that one line. I feel like you're harping so much on that one specific. The rest of the resume is gibberish, I got a cyst on my neck that doctors don't even know how to drain yet, bec--
jake: Special Skills: playing DVDs.
amir: Mhm. Just pop in, press play, and enjoy--
jake: Enjoy the ride. Yep, you wrote that. You also wrote, If it skips, cry till it's fixed.
amir: It rhymes.
jake: It doesn't.
amir:  Feel this. And you're worried about--
jake: Oh! God.
amir: If people can even talk about my music? Who cares about music!
jake: For Extracurriculars you have My cousin owns a laser tag; that's not really relevant.
amir: Yes it is, this is his resume.
jake: So you're not looking for a new job?
amir: No, I'm not- why would I look for a new job? I got the best coworkers in the world! 
INTRO
amir: Hey, you're watching Jake versus Amir.

The following is a note to my future self: firstly, don't tell Jake you got lost. Tell him you were at an Oscar after party, he'll think you're connected and cool. If he asks where the party is, spin another golden lie out of NOTHING. Shit, you forgot socks this morning, you idiot. This, coupled with the fact that you already forgot your shoes is gonna make you look like a real DUMBWAD. Okay, if Jake makes fun of you, just try and kick Pat in the face. Oh! Remember to look up the name of that song that's in your head right now.
amir singing: Oh, say can you see--
Horn blaring loudly.
amir: AAAAAOOWWW! Oh! And remember that sick freestyle that was in your head this morning! Okay, here it is.
amir rapping: Oh no, boom, pee pee in your bed, like a water balloon exploded in your head. No problem son, a lot of adults wear diapers to sleep, not a peep, tell no one about your liquidatious...
amir: And then... you couldn't think of anything to rhyme with liquidatious, okay. Oh! One last thing, grocery list okay. Buy adult diapers.
Jake picks up the phone.
jake: Yo!
amir: Oh, hey. Jake? 
amir : How do you do?
jake: Great. You know when you leave yourself a voicemail, it plays out loud so the entire office can hear it.
amir: Oh my gosh, you'll never guess where I was this morning.
jake: Yeah.
amir: An Oscar after party! Okay dude, I was with Forest Whitaker, Jake!
Car horn beeps.
amir: Forest--
Horn blares loudly again.
amir: AAAAHHOHH!

intro:
amir: This episode of Jake and Amir is brought to you...
jake: By what?
amir: I don't know.
jake: Hey, I'm just on my little brother's Facebook...
amir: Ah, me too me too
jake: No, yeah I know. Can you delete some of the things you posted on his wall?
amir: What's- what things-what's some things?
jake: Sorry, that wasn't a question. Delete everything you've ever posted on his wall before.
amir: Uh, he's nineteen years old dude. Cut the cord.
jake: He's seventeen.
amir: Dude lied to me then.
jake: Did he lie to you or did you maybe just read his birthday wrong on his page?
amir: Yeah maybe that's it.
jake: That's it. Some of these things are like offensive and others are just annoying.
amir: Give me one example of each.
jake: Here's an example of both. 'Hey did you get my poke? Poke me back if you got it, playa. Hey, my last poke said poke me back if you got it, playa. But, everybody has poke so I'm expecting one unless you're a faggot.'
Amir shrugs.
jake: What is that?
amir: A poke, it's like 'Hey, I got your attention but I don't have to write on your wall about it, just a way of saying...'
jake: Delete your Facebook.
amir:  Done.
jake: You didn't do anything. You just signed his wall again 'Hey, your big bro is acting like a toolbox extraordinary. Don't get mad if I piss on his jeans tonight.'
amir: A lot of these are just inside jokes between us so, butt it out.
jake: Well I just clicked on your wall to wall and he hasn't signed yours once and you leave him like videos like this.  "Micah, it's Amir. It's two am on a Wednesday. Poke that bitch or we're done!  Nah, no that was a joke but this is very serious. Call me right now. Your brother's hurt."
amir: Are you still pissed about the last time he visited?
jake: You mean when he went to get a drink from the water fountain and you shoved his face into it? Yeah, he lost two of his front teeth.
amir: Okay, I apologized for that.
jake: You said: 'Sorry you don't have a sense of humor, bitch.'
amir: And I genuinely meant that. Okay, I am sorry. I feel really badly that he doesn't have a sense of humor. Wh- What can I do? I can't go back and give him a sense of humor. It is what it is. I apologized.
jake: Just leave him alone, okay?
amir: Fine.  Hey Micah, it's me...
jake: Are you leaving him a video message right now?
amir: Your brother's being a real toolbox extraordinary but poke me or I'll fucking kill you.

Opening Sequence
amir:  Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir, and it's
jake: So creepy, stop it.
amir:  Sorry about that.
Episode
amir: Breakfast is served!
jake: Yes it was. What is all that?
amir: Can I interest the gentleman in, like, an English muffin or a crepe?
jake: Those are crepes?
amir: No no no no, these  are blintzes, these  are crepes. Okay?
jake: Think I'm good.
amir: No, you're not good, until you've had one of these omelettes, Amir style: with a little bit of salt.
jake: Yeah I think I don't want
amir: Well Amir style isn't just a little bit of salt, I lied. Okay, it's a lot of salt. And you're gonna enjoy half this thing of
salt. But, if you were out partying last night
jake: I wasn't.
amir: Okay, I was gonna say if you were out partying
jake: I wasn't.
amir: Well if you were partying, then you want one of these hangover killers, this huevos rancheros, made Amir style: no salt at all.
jake: You have a very inconsistent style.
amir: Yes.
jake: This food looks really old.
amir: Yeah it's about a day old, okay. I overdid it at brunch yesterday.
jake: You thought you could eat all of this food at brunch?
amir: I jokingly said to waitress yesterday at brunch, Hey, one of everything please. She starts giggling, there's a chemistry there,
so I smile at her, but I grab her forearm and I go, Hey, that wasn't a joke. I want one of everything, bitch. She takes me at face
value because, you know, duality of man or whatever. Bitch starts bringing out plate by plate for like an hour and a half! We're going
nuts! The whole restaurant's just up in arms. They start adding tables, because I'm at table for one, right, so there's not enough
room, there's not enough area to support all these plates. After every plate she's like, Are you sure you can afford all this stuff?
Because, you know, you've seen me on Saturday nights, I'm dressed like a vagrant or whatever. But I go, Hey, not only am I sure I'm
gonna pay you for all this stuff, but there's a tip in it for you. i start losing it, i am going nuts, this is crazy right? at 11:30 I
say eff it, I'm liveblogging the thing. It's going crazy, the Twitter sphere is just abuzz with this stuff. We're getting retweets,
comments on my message board, it's absolutely ridonculous. We're going crazy in there! All of a sudden I start feeling like I'm in a
fucking gameshow or something
jake: What gameshow?
amir: Alright, long story shirt, I'll give you a blintz for 11 bucks instead of 12 if you promise to throw in a little extra for the
huevos rancheros.
jake: Why would I pay you for your huevos rancheros?
amir: Alright lemme level with you man, because you're obviously not getting it. I can't afford to eat 500 dollars every time I go out.
i can't have that on my conscience, i can't have that on my card. so, this is what i'm gonna say to you: I finish all this food in
three minutes or less, you pay me for it. If I don't? Okay, I'll pay you double of what I paid.
jake: Fine.
amir: Alright, fine.  Ugh! I'm sorry, no. This is this is too salty.

jake: No. It's 5:30.
amir: Well, it's gotta be 5:30 somewhere.
jake: It is. Here.
amir: Just sendin' out my minions soon to do  the dirty work.  Sendin' out my minions to do the-
amir and jake: dirty work.
jake: Got it. I actually don't want you to explain anything else because I do not want to be involved in whatever you-
amir: 300 kids in 213 neighborhoods. All over the city. Plus! A little upstate New York. I even got one in Allentown, PA workin' for me! Dude's a little shit though. Met him on Facebook.
jake: How'd you meet the other ones?
amir: Facebook. But they all weren't little shits about it.
jake: Got it.
amir: Jake. These kids are bringin' home 2 pillow cases full of candy, min. I skim 10% off the top and pay them double face for each piece. 
jake: So you're paying them?
amir: Oh, out of the nose man. I'm like Willy Wonka, baby. Chomp Chomp, bitch.
jake: Willy Wonka never said that. Why would you pay them for candy bars?
amir: Dude it's ridiculous. I ended up owing a kid over $800 last year for a frickin' York Peppermint Patty.  I don't know.
jake: How is that two times face?
amir: That one got away from me. I'll admit it. It was a slippery slope there, so.
jake: Okay, well you know that: A) You can buy your own candy at the store and B-
amir: All right. Stop right there! Okay, because I'm not doing this for the candy, all right.
jake: So why are you paying kids literally hundreds of dollars-
amir: Thousands of dollars.
jake: Thousands of dollars!
amir: Can you just shut up one second?! I'm on Facebook Chat with this little twerp from Allentown. Now he's telling me that I have to pay for my own train ticket out there. Okay, so, how do I get back? Do I ask his dad for a ride? Clearly not because his dad's already pissed at me for talking to the 13-year-old while he's at school.
jake: Why are you wearing a dress?
amir: Okay, all right, all right. How long have you been sitting on that question, Hurwitz? What else?
jake: I'm serious. It's Thursday, it's not Halloween. There's no Halloween-
amir: Laundry Day. Okay?
jake: So you had no other clean clothes?
amir: No! What? No! Laundry Day is when I steal shit from Laundromats. You think I bought this dress? No! I'm like Willy Freakin' Wonka.
jake: You don't know who Willy Wonka is.
amir: Chomp. Chomp.
jake: Who's washing a fireman's helmet?
amir: You gotta promise not to tell on me, man.

INTRO Jake - Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir.  See, that's how you do it.
Amir - Yeah right. That sucked.
amir:  Hey.  Hey.  Hey. 
jake:  What?
amir: Can I have your father's e-mail address?
jake: No.
amir: I ASKED YOU VER-- . . .I asked you very politely, OK? It's nothing bad. So just give me his e-mail address.
jake: I don't care what it is, all right? You're not going to get my dad's address.
amir: All right, me and you have been arguing way too much recently and I think we just need to spend some time apart.
jake: OK. That's actually really mature of you.
amir: You know, just get away for a while. Just go our separate ways.
jake: You do not have to convince me. I completely agree.
amir: Perfect. Submitted.  You're about to be so happy.
jake: What?
amir: I just booked us--
jake: No. Stop.
amir: An eight night, ten day Mexican staycation!
jake: You just said you wanted to take a break!
amir: From work.
jake: Get away for a while.
amir: Yeah, from the office.
jake: You specifically said 'go our separate ways'!
amir:  Pack your bags, we leave tonight.
jake: I have plans tonight.
amir: I'm not taking 'no' for an answer.
jake: Well, take no for an answer, OK? Because I can't just get up and go on an 8 day vacation with you.
amir: STAYCATION!
jake: You're using that word wrong!
amir: Do you not get why we need this? Do you not see why we need this?!
jake: Do you understand why I'm not coming with you?
amir: Yeah, because it does 'fit' into your schedule!
jake: No, because it's eight days long and you told me about it 30 seconds ago!
amir: You know, why go on vacation? You just took me on a guilt trip.  Hey, that's pretty neat. Best part of all, I didn't have to drop 40K on that.  And we don't have to suffer through any all you can eat banana leaf buffets or go through any scuba diving lessons which is perfect because I'm deathly afraid of water anyways!!
jake: You can't make me feel bad for how you spend your money!
amir:  Bravo. Bravo. Bra--what a victim you are. You must be in the worst shape of ever.  I feel so bad for Jake.
jake: Does anybody want to go to lunch?
amir: You know what? Guess what? That e-mail I was going to send your dad? Yeah, it was bad. It was a Trojan horse.  You know what that is? It's a computer virus that would have taken down his whole network. Now do you want to go on a staycation with me? Or am I too crazy?!

a: I was lost for many moons, and many suns.
j: You were gone longer than eight days.
a: Yes, 17 moons, and oddly 21 suns.
j: That's not possible.

INTRO Amir - Hey, you're amazing and you're beautiful.
Jake - Just introduce the video.
Amir - I love you.
amir: Hey, did you get my e-mail about me wanting to pitch you movie ideas?
jake: I did. Did you get my response about how I didn't want to do that?
amir: All right, first up. It's a movie, but it's also a sweater. What?! You can wear it, you can watch it, you can do whatever. Looks fabulous, be good. It's sweater: the movie.
jake: No.
amir: So you know how every good movie is just a combination of two other movies?
jake: No.
amir: OK, so you're definitely not going to like Fever Hitch.
amir: This one is based on a script.
jake: All movies are based on a script.
amir: Not documentaries!  OK, so it's a documentary about scripts, right?
amir: The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo Fast, and Too Furious. No.
amir: Stewart Thinkpen was an average guy--
jake: Pass.
amir: Argh, sorry, just took me forever to perfect that voice. 
jake: Ow-ow!
amir: Harold and Maud and Kumar. OK.
amir: Oh! If you liked the sweater movie--
jake: I didn't.
amir: --Well, let me get through the freaking pitch without you tainting it with your negativity! Sweater 2: The Jacketing.
jake: No.
jake: Hey man, will you not do that right now?
amir: It's like, a lot of it is just dead skin.
amir: American Beauty and the Beast.  Just give me something man.
amir: She was a girl who had all the answers. He was the boy who had just one big question. And then--argh, I've got nothing. If you've got something, that'll help me out a lot.
jake: Well, let's just pass on it for now.
amir: All right. Maybe piling it. 
amir: The Sisterhood of the Traveling Antz, with a 'Z'.
jake: No.
amir: OK, maybe. 
jake: That's--Sorry. So the circles mean maybe? Because you've circled every single idea I've said no to.
amir: The Talented Mr. Ripley's Believe It Or Not.
jake: That one is not even a movie.
amir: Not yet. These are pit-- Oh, I see. Rip--Yeah. Maybe.
amir: Uh, all right. I think that went well.
jake: It didn't. I said no to literally everything you pitched.
amir: Well, now I know what you don't want to hear, so that I can sort of re-imagine everything--
jake: Don't think of any more movie ideas, all right? Man, you're really bad at it and I would quit entirely.
amir: Ouch.  That is a tough pill to swallow. Heh, you got to understand that I was really jazzed about these ideas last night. I was like air-boxing with no one, writing them down, getting super jazzed. So for me to hear that, that's tough man. That's tough for me to hear.
amir:  I guarantee that if you knew what you were saying to me, if you knew how much that would affect me, that you wouldn't have said half the stuff you just said.
jake: I think I'm going to go. 
amir: Yeah, I think I'm going to peace out too. I might take a personal day because I feel like there's a--
jake: Well you just got back from a two and a half week long Mexican vacation.
amir: STAYCATION! And-- You're right. Why'd you say that stuff, man?

jake: Hey, you are watching Jake and Amir.
amir: You smug little prick.
jake: Wow, wow wow!
amir: Sorry.
Amir walking around next to the elevator. The elevator arrives and Jake comes out.
amir:  Ha ha ha! Bye, dude! I'll see you!  Hey, what's up?
jake: Were you waiting for me by the elevator?
amir: No! I was talking to my friend Raymond and then he had to leave the second that you got here.
Jake and Amir start walking to their desks.
amir: Anyway, what have you done today?
jake: So far? I woke up...
amir: Same.
jake: ...got dressed...
amir: Same same.
jake: ...came to work.
amir: Same same same, triple same, knasty knasty. I'm actually pumped to work with you today.
jake: On what?
amir: Just being at work is a thrill. Why do you have to question on what?
They stop walking.
jake: What is that?
Jake's desk is wrapped in toilet paper.
amir: Oh! Cowards! Everyone here is a coward for that. Bastard got my desk too.
Jake starts removing the toilet paper from the desk. Amir stops him.
amir: Stop, okay! Stop, it's not worth it! We are gonna get through this!
Amir tries to hug Jake. Jake stops him by putting his hand on Amir's face.
amir: We are gonna get through this!
Amir tries to hug Jake again and Jake stops him again.
amir:  Gonna get, gonna get, my mind off you!
Amir tries again to hug Jake and Jake stops him again.
jake: It's not that bad.
amir: It's not that bad!? It's wet!
Amir grabs a water bottle and starts pouring water on the paper. Jake stops him.
jake: Hey, hey! You're doing that! Did you do this?
amir:  No, I couldn't have done this, because earlier this morning I went pet shopping with my friend Raymond from earlier, and then we both got a hamster and went to my apartment and then we got to work at the same time. My hamster's name is...  Toilet Paper, and toilet paper...
jake: I didn't ask you the hamster's name, and wow, you should have thought of a name that didn't sound like toilet paper.
amir: Alright, let's just blow today. Can't we just take a personal day and go for a picnic or something? I'm sure the bandit left us some sandwiches and a frisbee.
jake: He didn't.
amir: Check under your desk maybe it's there.
Jake checks under the desk.
jake: Nothing.
Amir checks under the desk.
amir: What!? No! How..? Who... who did... THIS ... it's what I'm pissed about.
jake: The toilet paper?
amir: Yeah. Well, you know what? The bandit must have left the food and the frisbee at my apartment earlier today because he was distracted, busy with the scheming of things, so why don't we swing by my apartment and then the bandit might have to take a dump real quick.
jake: The bandit or you?
amir:  Alright, just cut me some slack man, at least I'm trying.
jake: You're lying.
amir: I'm lying because you don't trust me ever.
jake: How can I trust you? You lie all the time!
amir: Why tell the truth to someone who always thinks you're lying?
Jake looks confused.
amir: Alright, you want the truth? The truth is I just wanted to hang out with you, okay? I'm sorry, I wanted to go on a picnic with you. But then... this bandit!  With this joke, this prank just ruined everything! Let's just... let's get out of here, man. Let's just forget it. Let's set it and forget it. I think best course of action: GTFO.

INTRO  Jake - You were supposed to do this one.
Amir - Ack, my bad.
Jake - Bad.
jake:  Hey. Where are you?
amir:  Good good, man. How are you?
jake: I said 'where are you?'.
amir: I'm fine. I'm better than fine, actually. I'm great. Hey, uh, could you do me a flavor?  No, I said flavor instead of favor but could you go into my drawer and pull out one of the pieces of paper that's there?
jake: Wow, these are a lot of reckless driving tickets.
amir: OK, could you go like five minutes without editorializing?
jake: Sorry, but I'm just saying--
amir: I'm serious, I was talking to Sarah and like we both agree that you never say anything plainly. You always have to like, have the last word and it just, it gets really tiring.
jake: OK, I'm going to hang up.
amir: W-w-wait! Could you find one that says 'oh, good driving sir. We owe you eleven hundred dollars'? And please do it without adding your two cents for once.
jake: OK, there's one that says you owe them eleven hundred dollars.
amir: No, that's not it. Keep looking. Keep looking for the one where it says they owe me the cash.
jake: Just...before I keep looking, police don't do that.
amir: You sure about that? Like is that a fact or is this another case of the Jake's, where you just keep on talking to hear the sound of your own voice because honestly, if it's the latter--
jake: It's fact.
amir: Bitches and cream, that blows.
jake: You have tickets. You owe the police money. A lot of money.
amir: Fu-udge-sicles. Anyways, how was your weekend?
jake: It's Tuesday afternoon!
amir: Good good, yeah, mine was bad. Really bad, actually. I got arrested for doing 90 in a zero.
jake: A zero?
amir: Well there's no like sign or anything but it was a freakin' kindergarden so yeah, I think you're supposed to go zero!
jake: Look, I know this is a small thing to bring up but before, when you first called and I said 'where are you?' and you thought I said 'how are you?' . . . you said you were good.
amir: OK, please don't do this now, OK? I'm being held without bail, so it would be really nice just to hear someone say that it is not my fault.
jake: I do think it's your fault.
amir: There you go again with the talkie-talkie! You sound like the freakin' cop that I punched. Hey, what was the name of that song...?
jake: I whip my hair back and forth.
amir: Yes. That's the one. Tight.

jake: Hey, you're watching Jake  Amir.
amir: Hey, starting when?
jake: Now.
amir: So say that!
jake: Take that, pig f***er.
amir : Hey!
jake: Someone's in here.
amir: Jake! Jake!
jake: Yeah, I'm in here.
amir: Where are you?
jake: In the- Where are you? Right? You're in the bathroom. So, where am I? In the bathroom.
amir: Okay, you just left your desk two minutes ago and you didn't say anything.
jake: I said I'd be right back!
amir: sighs What does that mean?
jake: It means I'll be right back and not to follow me to the bathroom.
amir: Okay, should I chill out here, or you want me to wait for you?
jake: Just chi- Okay, I see what you did. Neither. Alright? Just go away.
amir: Hey! Let me in, okay? Somebody's coming.
jake: No.
amir : Hey! Get outta here! Nobody's takin' a poop here! Mind your own bees!
jake: Hey, whoever that is, don't worry, you can go to the bathroom. It's fine.
amir: He already left.
jake: Come on man. We have to work here, right?
amir: How much longer do you have in there?
jake: I don't know, alright? I can't exactly go to the bathroom with you here talking to me.
amir: Fine, fine. I'll stay, but I won't say anything.
jake: That makes no sense, but fine.
amir: Hey, I read on Yahoo News that laptops are cooking people's-
jake : Hey man, you just said you weren't gonna say anything.
amir: Alright, fine, okay? Keep it mum, alright? Mum's the word.
jake: Thank you.
amir : Mum! Huh! What is it good for? Absolutely nothing!
jake: Jesus Christ, man! What is wrong with you?
amir: Me? You said no talking! That was a kick!
jake: Yeah, you were singing!
amir: Oh my god! Singing isn't talking.
jake: Yes it is!
amir: Why do I- Why do I bother? Why do I bother if you're just not gonna like it?
amir: It just doesn't- I don't buy it man. I'm sorry, it doesn't make sense. Why would I- Why would I do this? Like, it doesn't- It doesn't help. You don't like me. It just drives you away even more, and then mumble in the bathroom? That's so- it's cold, man. This is a waste of time.
amir: Hey, you're watching me!
jake: And me.
amir: Well... mostly me, though, if you think about it.
amir: Can I have the rest of that bar -- that Kit Kat bar?
amir:  Break me off a piece of that tick tack tart.
jake: You obviously knew what it was called.
amir: Just give me a break, man.  Give me a break, man. Give me a break--
jake: I only have one bar left.
amir: Which means you've had three! So give me one! Give me one of your four bars. Just give me one of the four!
jake: Fine! Fine! Here. Take it.
amir:  No thank you. You know what? On second thought, I don't really want it. I'm watching my weight -- watching it go up.  No, I'm going to toss it, though. 
jake: Why did you do that?
amir: I had a second thought.
jake: So give it back to me!
amir: You already gave it up, okay? It was mine to throw away. I had a second thought; I didn't want it anymore; so I threw it away. What's it to ya?
jake: It was my candy bar.
amir: You gave it to me.
jake: You took it from me!
amir: I asked you for it and you gave it to me, so it was mine. I could have done whatever I want with it, alright? It's gone now. Forget it. Let it go. It's a sunk cost. Live life without the bar.
jake: Fine!
amir:  Fine! Just, ughh...  So, if I eat it and two days later I take a crap and it goes in the toilet, he doesn't complain about that. But if I put it in the garbage now, then it's a bigger deal. I don't understand what the difference is. It's not his. It's gone. But he just latches on. He latches on and I can't let it get to me. I just have to let it go-- IT'S A FRICKIN' KIT KAT BAR, MAN! It's 99 cents! What do you want?! A quarter? You want a quarter for it, you're going to be that petty? Just forget it, man! Just pretend that I dropped it on the ground and I didn't want to eat it -- does that make you sleep at night?
jake: Why don't we just move on?
amir: Well, I'm not going to let you sit here and sulk about it, okay? Say something! You're obviously pissed!
jake: Yes, I am pissed! I said I just wish you didn't throw it away.
amir: Yeah? Well, sometimes wishes don't come true. I'm sorry.
jake: Whatever.
amir: I mean, when I was six I had a wish, too. I had a wish that everybody I knew would be dead. How's that for a wish?
jake: I don't know -- selfish?
amir: Bet you wish that one didn't come true.
jake: Yeah.
amir: You know, if you're gonna be a bitch about it, then here:  A full Kit Kat bar. Enjoy that, ya bitch!
jake: So why'd you want one of mine?
amir: Okay, you know what? Here!  Take the whole lot! Jakey gets all the Kit Kats. Enjoy them, ya bitch!
jake: Why do you have these?
amir: Because I buy two or three a day and I save one, okay? But I bet you knew that already, didn't you, bitch?
jake: I clearly didn't.
amir: Alright, you know what? Here's an idea: We go bar for bar -- see who can eat the most candy.
jake: You just said you were watching your weight.
amir: Yeah! Watching it go up!
jake: So, that wasn't even a joke?
amir:  Are we doing this contest, or not?!
intro:
jake: Hey you're watching Jake and Amir
amir: Sorry are you gonna finish that sandwich?
jake: That's the microphone.
amir: Well just give it to me!
jake: Hey--
amir: Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Speak!
jake: My cousin just sent me the new "Auto Tune the News" clip, and you know those creepy facebook wall posts you leave me?
amir: Yes.
jake: Like the ones late at night where you--
amir: Yes I remember, I don't-- you don't have to give me a history lesson.
jake: Well they're a song now.
 / Poke my wall  / Poke my face  / Poke my pictures  / Poke my videos / I want you to poke my status / And I want you to poke yourself / Go poke yourself")
amir: What? Which cousin?
jake: That's not important.
amir: Evan? Johnny? Scott?
jake: Madeleine.
amir: Mad- Okay,  girl? So she's not your cousin!
jake: You can have female cousins.
amir: No I can't! Okay, both my parents are only children; you knew that.
jake: You have a cousin named Leron.
amir: He's adopted!
jake: By who?! Alright focus. Focus, okay. You're in an internet video.
amir: ...what.
jake: Lots of people are watching it and you look like a needy loser.
amir: You look like a jerk!
jake: I'm not even in the video. And trust me, if I were in an internet video, nobody would think I was a jerk.
amir: Ugh, this is not what I envisioned when they asked me for permission and I said yes.
jake: What?
amir: Yeah, they emailed me and asked if they could use my creepy videos to make a funny song out of it. Well, I'm not laughing!
jake: So they asked for your permission.
amir:  They gave me final cut approval, okay? Three weeks ago they send me a rough and it just sat in my inbox. Yesterday, on a whim, I reply "I have no notes". I don't know what got into me; it just happened. Ninety minutes later they send me a final cut; I guess they made some last minute audio tweaks. I respond, sight unseen, "This is f***ing gold, I'm proud to know you guys. Love, Amir", and then, this thing!
jake: So this sounds like it's mostly your fault.
amir: Lemme just-- lemme see if I can ask them to take it down or something.
 are standing. They greet each other and Amir kisses Andrew's hand.
amir: I think that video's gotta go down or something.
michael: If you don't want it up then we'll take it down right away.
amir: Yeah that's true. I dunno, I feel bad.
andrew: We told you from the get-go, you've got total veto power.
amir: That's true. I dunno, it is catchy.
evan: Well, why don't you go take it down yourself? We made you an admin on the page.
amir: Shut up okay! Maybe-- Let's just keep it up at this point.
jake: Hey, before you turn around and tell me that they can't delete the video, just know that I heard that entire--
amir: Yeah it's a no-go on the vid going down, man, I'm sorry, I talked to them but they won't budge. They're being douchebags about it!
evan:  It's not like that--
amir:  --BAH, so.
andrew:  He paid us money to do this.
amir: They didn't do that. No--
michael:  I just took it down.
amir: DON'T DELETE IT! Put it back up then!  I can actually, I'm an admin, right? 
evan and michael: Yeah.
END.
outro:
amir:  You don't have to poke, I'll be poke. They're looking for poke. They're gon' find you. They're gon' find poke. And you can poke and--
michael:  Shawty...
evan: That is... That's an *idea*.
amir:  It's a good *idea*.  So you can poke and tell-- You don't have to poke anywhere, I'm lookin' for poke! I'm gon'... Is- I can't really do it solo.
michael:  I just deleted it.
amir: Don't delete it, put it back up!
michael: I just put it back up.

Couldn't find this one on youtube?  Amir's injury in this ep is a reference to the previous episode, rock paper scissors.
intro:
amir: Haayyyyyy
jake: Hurry.
amir: Well, let's take our time FOR ONCE, because--
sarah:  Man, I can't believe you like the meatballs at Ikea; that stuff's like Swedish prison food!
pat: Hey, let's ask Julian Assange in a few years, that traitor will be begging for meatballs, at that point!
jake: That's good, that's very good.
amir: That's good, that's very good; can I tell that at my French lesson tonight?
sarah: Oh, I didn't know you took French! That's good!
jake:  Wuwuwuwait a second,  you don't know why that joke is funny.
amir:  ...Yes I do.
jake: Why?
amir: Cuz you guys laughed at it.
jake: B-b-but why were we laughing?
amir: B-b-because it was funny!
jake: You're an idiot.  You can't even have regular political banter with us .
amir: Well then explain it to me!
jake: You're beyond hope, dude, you're beyond that.
sarah: Jake, c'mon, just explain it to him.
jake: You wanna do it? Good luck.
amir: Haha, who's Julian Assange?
jake: Right off the bat he doesn't even know who this chick is.
pat: Chick?
jake: Guy. He doesn't know who the guy is. You can't just, learn who people are.
amir: Yeah you can, you just learn who people are, you learn--
jake: Here's a tip. Here's a little tip for you right now. Teach a man to fish, right? You don't know who someone is? Take our your phone, type his name into Google. Julius Assand, right? My phone doesn't have service right now, but if it did, I'd be able to tell you who he is, in two seconds.
amir: You don't know who he is, do you?
jake:  He thinks I don't know who Julian Assand is!
pat: I don't think you know who he is either.
jake: Wow, I always knew you were stupid, but I didn't know you were dumb, too.
amir: HAHAHAHA--
jake: I know who Mickey Mantle is. Number seven. The New York Yankees. How's that for stupid?
sarah: Yeah but who's Julian Assange?
jake: Born Mickey Charles Mantle. That's something you don't learn on Google.
pat: Yes you do.
jake: Good lunch, everybody. I'm gonna go. Pat, you get joke of the lunch with the Julian Assand thing, which a low five from me.  Too slow! I get runner-up, second-best joke of lunch with the too slow thing, looks like I'm too school for school ; sorry just kidding, too COOL for school, not a mess-up because I caught it first. Once again y'all are too slow and once again Julian Assand can--  ah!ah! --eat a penis pie 'til the day he die. This has been a Jake Hurwitz production, a.k.a.: I'M OUT!
pat: That was weird.
sarah: Yeah--
amir:  That wasn't weird! That was funny! YOUR joke was weird!
sarah: Anyway, Amir, Julian Assange is the founder of Wikileaks, this website, and he recently got arrested for sexual assault on a Swedish warrant, so. It's kinda like an international--
jake: Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot all my food, but if you guys are still talking about Julian Assange, he's the frickin founder of Wikileaks!
amir: What's Wikileaks?
jake: You gotta learn how to be funny, man. I'll tell you.. I'll tell you exactly what Wikileaks is, right now, if you can catch my low five.
jake: Too slow!
amir: I touched it!
jake: Ya knicked it!
amir: I slapped it!--
jake:  You KNICKED it!
END.
intro:
jake: What's up? You're watching Jake and Amir.
amir: HA now you're all like what's up!
jake: What?
amir: You're a joke, man.
[Jake and Amir are sitting at their desks. Amir is typing on his laptop and laughing.)
jake: Hey- dude! I'm not gonna ask you again. Stop responding to this email thread.
amir: Oh, you're getting them?
jake: Yes! We're getting them! Are you not getting them? Eleven people have replied and asked you to stop!
amir: Stop what? We're having a good time!
jake: Darren's fiance is in the hospital.
amir: Okay... didn't know that.
jake: How could you not know that, this entire thread has been about that.
amir: That's not true, a lot of my emails are about other., stuff.
jake: No! They're not, and they're really offensive! Like you said I got a gift idea: a new fiance, because his is broken. Does anybody have the number for the slut store? I left mine in Darren's dick LOL. What does that mean?
amir:  It doesn't mean anyth- it's a joke! It's a joke!
jake: Is it? Is this one also a joke? I saw Darren's fiance eating a cockmeat sandwich last night. Need proof? See attached pic., with no picture attached.
amir: Ok I followed up on that.
jake: You did, five seconds later you said Sorry for the bogus attachment, y'all. Click here to see Darren's finance--spelled that wrong...
amir: Auto-corrected.
jake: It's not. You said Click here to see Darren's finance in all her glory holes., but there's no link. Five seconds later you follow up with a link to a random GeoCities page that says Under Construction.
amir: Yeah, I started that in seventh grade. Gave up on it, right quick. 
jake: Ok, well either way--
amir: You know I've been thinking about dusting it off, you know taking it out for a spin again, maybe turning it into like a webzine, or like a fanzine of sorts--
jake: For what?
amir: . For what?. Can I ask you a question, why do you never believe in me?
jake: Focus. Alright this is the last thing I'll say, and it's not directly related to this specific thread, but you gotta change your email signature, man.
amir: Why?
jake:  It's porn.
amir: It's art!
jake: Barely.
amir: Alright want me to teach you? The trick is to do Shift-2 when you want to draw a pussy. Now, let's talk about that fanzine for a sec. I'm gonna lobby you some ideas and you say Yes! if they're good, Totally!, if they're bad, and I love it! if you love it.
jake: Ok so yes, totally, and I love it?
amir: Yea.
jake: Alright, so it sounds like you're just trying to protect yourself against negative feedback.
amir: Yea I don't like negativity.
jake: Really? You could've fooled me, cuz you just sent this email, five seconds ago, while we were talking, and it's Darren's fiance with a skull and crossbones Photoshopped above her head, and it says Rest In Pieces.
amir:  Ok you gotta believe me, man. I got a photo of her eating a cockmeat sandwich, I was just too afraid to send it out. I'll put it on the fanzine!
END.
intro:
amir:  In west Philadelphia two best friends hanging out and have fun-
jake: Stop! Stop.
jake:  Alright, and this is my desk. Pretty fun, right?
amir: Haha, pretty fun right?  Introduce me!
jake: Alright, Amir this is my cousin Madeleine.
amir: Oooo, somebody's gonna get their period soon!
jake: Hey! Hey! Don't say stuff like that!
madeleine: I already had my period.
amir: It's nothing you should be ashamed of. That's all I'm gonna say.
jake: Okay, she's not ashamed.
amir: She should be, a little, but...
jake:  Okay, you just said she shouldn't be.  Madeleine, it's perfectly natural.
amir: I- I'd be ashamed.
jake: Oh my God! You should be ashamed.
madeleine: I got it when I was twelve. It's not a big deal.
amir: That's early, that's way early!
madeleine: No it's not.
amir: Who told you it wasn't?
madeleine: My mom.
amir: She's a lying bitch! Jake?
jake: Dude, that's my aunt! You can't say stuff like this!
amir: Do you not want me to be real? Okay, I'm a lot of things, but you can't say that I'm not honest.
jake: Yes I can. You just told her she had nothing to be ashamed of, then you went off on this rant.
amir: I can apologize for being mean, but I'm not gonna mean it.
madeleine: You're a loser.
amir: You're- Okay, Jake? Whose side are you gonna take, man?
jake: Hers.
amir: You know, it was unfair of me to ask you this early in the game; take the weekend to think about it.
madeleine: You're dumb.
amir:  Choose me, please. Please choose me. I have- she's cutting me deep and I need to hear that I have a friend right now.
jake:  Will you please grow up?!
amir: Shuh-! She did it first, that stupid bitch!
jake: Wow! Alright, we are gonna go. We have Christmas shopping to do.
amir: Ooo, what's the matter? Santa Claus not workin' this year? Oh yeah, I forgot: he doesn't exist.
madeleine: I knew that already.

amir: Hey you're watching Jake and Amir, unless it's open like behind the browser then it's like you're just listening--
jake: I'm doing the next one.
amir: Okay.
(Amir is standing at a kitchen counter, with a pile of food all over it.
amir : Accept my poke, that's it. Then poke me back. Game Over...
jake: What are you doing?
amir: You scared me man! Dinner is a-swerved.
jake: How did you get into my apartment?
amir: Sorry, served not swerved.
jake: Look. How did you get in here?
amir: Obviously dinner's not gonna be swerved--
jake: How did you get in?!
amir : Oh!
jake: Those aren't my keys.
amir: I know, I just sort of put them in between my knuckles and punched through the window, shattering it. Then entering through the shattered window hole.
jake: Got it. I can see that.
amir: So, anyway, take a seat. Dinner will be out momentarily.
jake: What did you cook.
amir: Didn't have to. Ordered Thai instead.
jake: You ordered-- So why's my kitchen such a mess?
amir: You're gonna laugh when you hear this. I tried to make a 100-layer vegan lasagna. What? Who does that?
I built it up too much man, you would've been dying. Anyway I got frustrated, a little bit pissed, and I started messing things up.
jake: Why'd you get pissed?
amir: You're gonna laugh when I tell you this.
jake: Look, trust me, I'm not going to laugh when you tell me anything. You've destroyed my kitchen.
amir: I got angry, okay, I lost it for half a second, but! it'll all be worth it when that hundo-layer veg las comes out of the oven.
jake: I thought you said you didn't make it.
amir: You're right. Damn it, you're right! I suck!
jake: Chill out, chill out, okay. You don't suck.
amir: I do, I messed everything up. And now the Thai food's here. And I don't even have money to pay for it.
jake: Why didn't you bring money?
amir: Because I didn't think to because I'm such an idiot! Because I'm such a loser!
jake: It's fine, chill out. I'll pay for it, you can owe me.
amir: That's even worse, okay! I don't even want to owe you anything!
jake: I was just saying it so you wouldn't feel like you were taking a handout.
amir: I appreciate that, but, y'know, I don't want to owe you anything, ever! Like I don't even want to pay you off eventually, at this point I'd rather open the door, take the Thai food, spin him around, kick him in the small of the back and lock him out!
jake: Okay just chill out, I'll pay for it, you don't owe me, it's fine.
amir : got this blond bimbo wrapped around--
jake: Got the Thai.
amir: Got the Thai, good.
jake: Did you mean to send me this text message? got this blond bimbo wrapped around my finger. another free dinner down the gizzard because I own house at fake crying?
amir: I've been thinking about it and I want to go Dutch on the Thai.
You gotta spot me my half though man. You gotta go Double Dutch for me. Can you do that for me bimbo?
amir: Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir... even though the old videos used to be funnier. Why don't you just watch the old videos?
jake:  Wow! Stop!
amir:  Hey, can I ask you a question?
jake: Mimes can't talk.
amir:  Can I ask you a question?!
jake: What?
amir: It was about if mimes can talk. But you already answered it so, wow -- that was hard.
jake: So, why'd you yell at me still?
amir: 
amir: 
jake: No noise!
amir: I'm starting to really regret dressing up as a mime.
jake: Now you're starting to regret it?! Not when people threw coins at you on the subway? Or when Ricky called you into his office and said you have to take this job more seriously? How about when you spent 45 minutes outside in the snow because the secruity guard wouldn't let you into our building -- how did you feel then?
amir: 
jake: See, that's good. You don't say anything.
amir:  Not saying anything...
jake: Exactly.
amir:  Zero. Audio. Output.
jake: Completely silent.
amir:  Completely... silent... not... a peep... from me--
jake:  You're peeping! You're talking right now.
amir: Well, that's because you're not giving me any feedback!
jake: I was giving you feedback. Just shhh.
amir: 
jake: That's good...
amir: You're not just saying that?
jake: No. Just be quiet...
amir: You really mean that?
jake:  You know what?! Alright, you really suck at this! Why don't you just go wash the face paint off!
amir: It's called spray paint.
jake: Wow. You shouldn't have spray painted your face -- how did you do your lips?
amir: Like Binaca, okay? You form a wall with your tongue and go [pantomiming spraying at his open mouth) khh, khh, khh, and hope for the best.
jake: Oh my God...
amir: Hey, does everything taste like lead to you, or is that just a mime thing?
introduction:
amir: Hey you're watching chick and Amir. See it sounds exactly the same.
jake: No it doesn't.
jake: If you ever want to see your friend Amir again, you will give me three zillion dollars.
amir: Hey!
amir: Ow! What the heck man? What if that was real?
jake: I could see you hiding under your desk. There were a lot of typos in there by the way
amir: Okay, you try finding every letter.
jake: You couldn't find an N or an O?
amir: I was limited. All right. I had one "Guns and Ammo" mag and that's it.
jake: There's no E in your by the way.
amir: There's no E in team either, bro.
jake: You're mixing up that metaphor. Why do you have a "Guns and Ammo" magazine?
amir: It came free with my gun,  and my ammo! Ha ha! No, but just the gun though.
jake: Is that real?
amir: No! I paid 23 hundred dollars for a fake Kimber stainless Raptor 2.  Ha ha. It's very real. 
jake: That makes me real nervous man.
amir:  Yeah, I would be nervous too. All right. A .45 caliber, 5 inch, match grade steel barrel hand fitted by Kimber himself, pointed straight at my gut hole!
jake: I don't have a gut hole.
amir: Well this'll make one brotha! Say goodnight! Pfffff! 
jake: Easy! Don't point that thing at me!
amir: You easy okay! There's no bullets in this thing idiot!
jake: Please put that down.
amir: Do you trust me?
jake: No.
amir: Do you trust me?
jake: NO.
amir:  Then I'm gonna pull the trigger.
jake: Okay I trust you all right. Put it down.
amir: Well if you trusted me, you wouldn't say put it down.
jake: I do trust you!
amir: DO YOU?
jake: Yes! I don't know! Yes.
amir: Why are you nervous if you trust me?
jake: I don't know okay!
amir: Then you don't trust me and I'm gonna pull it! In 3...2...
jake: Stop! Stop, stop, stop, stop! I do trust you, all right?
amir: Then if you do trust me, pull it yourself. 
jake: I don't wanna do that man!
amir: Trust me! Pull it!
jake: I can't!
amir: You can!
jake: I can't dude!
amir: Ay look! Look at me! I'm telling you, there's no bullets. Pull the trigger!
amir: You pussy!
jake: I can't do it! 
amir: Then I'll do it!
amir: There was one bullet in it okay. Sue me.
amir: Aye! I'm Rick James!  No?
jake: No.
amir: Okay this  is a great Facebook profile pic man.  It's a great shot of you.  Right?
jake: These are all fine.
amir: Look at them at least, man.  Okay what about this one?
jake: You just smell really really awful right now.
amir:  This is an awesome shot dude, it says sunglasses, very cool California boy with a chill attitude and a red shirt.  Hey!
jake: So this was a very very thoughtful thing for you to do, thank you.
amir: Welp, thank me later, because this is the one I was e-mailing you about. 
jake: E-mailing me, calling me, texting me...
amir: This is autumn Jake, left you a little bit of wiggle room on the left and right in case you wanted to Photoshop me in there.  The problem is, this is an autumn picture.  When December rolls around, you're gonna need a winter photo, okay?  Hey John, can we see that December photo?  Here we are... this is November! Heh, John, just the December photo please.   He's good he's just a little bit slow...JOHN! JOHN! JOHN! JOHN!   Thank you.  Um... this is January!  We'll power through, thank you.  Can we get two waters and  do you want anything?
jake: So both waters are for you?
amir: Four waters please.   This is winter.  Keep in mind this wasn't the one I was talking about.  But this gives you a great idea of what I was meaning.  Beanie, sweater, gui-tar!
jake: Okay look!  I really appreciate your noble intentions here but you smell like shit and you're freaking me out with the excessive pictures of me.  So I'd like you to go away.
amir: Absolutely.  A good salesman knows when enough is enough.
jake: It's coming from your mouth so don't talk at me like that.
amir: Mhm.  I'm gonna leave these photos with you.
jake: Take them with you.
amir: Yes, of course.  Obviously you don't wanna carry around a whole portfolio filled with pictures.  Let me leave you the best one-
jake: Take them all! Alright?  Take 'em all.
amir: Mhm.  Customer is always right.  And in this case,  you're the customer!
jake: You have to stop talking so close to my face alright?  You smell like absolute shit.
amir: You're right.  You're absolutely right.  I smell like doo-doo.
jake: What did you eat by the way?
amir: I had a very very very old radish and a little dollop of mayo and I just let that sit in my mouth overnight, so...
jake: Hey everybody, we just wanted to say thank you so much for being a fan of Jake and Amir on Facebook. We just got to-  Wake up.  - 150,000 Facebook fans, which is--
amir:  Wow, 150,000?? Wow. That must be the most ever! Oh wait, no, Vin Diesel has nineteen point nine million!
jake: Why do you just know that off the top of your head?
amir: Do you have any idea how far we are from that? Were--
jake: I bet you dont know.
amir: --billions away and thats-
jake: Right, you dont.
amir: -Were never going to get there and I--
jake: OK, just say thank you, all right?
amir: Thanks for what? Thanks for Vin Diesel for stealing our fans.
jake: He- How do you- Why would you think hes stealing our fans?
amir: I wouldnt put it past him. That shifty bald--
jake: Stop recording, please.

amir: You know what this is? 
jake: Not work
amir: Not even close
jake: That's not a good thing
amir: It's a suggestion box
jake: 'Siggestion box', actually
amir: How do I know how to improve myself, without people writing on tiny little slips of paper, and put it in anonimously into my suggestion box
jake: You know, you spend a lot of time at work being unproductive and just generally doing things that aren't your job
amir: Let me stop you right there

amir: If I s--, if I see, if I see that poison in here
jake: Stop saying poison
amir: You know, it just doesn't have to be a suggestion of what I'm doing wrong, it could be like a suggestion of what I'm doing right
jake: Then it wouldn't be a suggestion
amir: Actually, should be that, should be tips of how I'm doing stuff well
jake: Then it wouldn't be a tip. I think you've lost, you've lost track of the concept here
amir: I would never, tell you how to improve yourself, ok? And that's not just because your perfect
jake: You are not my friend
amir: You're gonna be humming a different tune once I, open the box
jake: How would that change anything?
amir: You are preaching into the choire, and I love that
jake: Ok, you have gone of the rails now. At least you've started from a logical place thinking that a suggestion box could better helping yourself, but now you are speaking half metaphores which you don't entirely unders--
amir: Shh. Put it in the box 
jake: How long is your arm?

Jake - Dammit.
Amir - Sorry.
EPISODE
Amir - 
Jake - Did you just lock the door?
Amir - Alright, I left this  on my desk for 2 days so let's
see what people really think about me.
Jake - Just remember to have thick skin, alright-
Amir - My skin is FINE alright, so shut it. You know I'm sensitive about that kind of stuff.
Jake - What kind of stuff?
Amir - Stuff about me. 
Jake - Don't hit me, please. Don't hit me.
Amir - Ugh, this box is like jammed, do you have scissors or something?
Jake - No, I don't just carry scissors around with me.
Amir - Whoa, ok you don't have to tell me twice. Heheh. GIVE ME THE SCISSORS.
Jake - So I do have to tell you twice.
Amir - Yeah, alright. You know, just give me your scissors and we'll call it even... Unless you want another one of these .
Amir - Alright, first one is a joke, so I'm gonna pass on that grass.
Jake - What's it say?
Amir - It says "You should work harder, you're never at work on time and I often see you doing stuff that isn't related to your job". Heheh, someone's goofin' me. .
Jake - Don't.
Amir - Hi, my name's Dan from the Witness Protection Program, can I have your scissors sir?
Jake - That doesn't even make any sense.
Amir - Ok, this one's got to be a goof. "I reek of garbage." Uh, not a suggestion.
Jake - It says right there you should shower regularly.
Amir -  Ok, if you don't know the difference between a goof and a real suggestion you should just leave.
Jake - Alright, I'll go.
Amir - That was a goof.
Amir - Alright, this one's upside down, I shall discard it, AS A GOOF.
Jake - "When you walk into the office, it literally feels like I'm being water-boarded with diarrhea, the stench of a billion farts."
Amir - Jesus, that one...  THAT WAS A GOOF.
Amir - Oh what's that game? Rock, paper,...
Jake - Scissors.
Amir - HAH.
Jake - Doesn't mean I have them.
Amir -  This one's a real goooof says Goofy. Hahah.
Jake - It just says "die".
Amir - .
Amir - Ahh, let's see the next goof.
Jake - You've taken to calling them goofs before you even read them.
Amir -  Yeah, that's a goof. 
Amir - This one's not so bad, "More healthy options in the vending machine".
Jake - Alright, I think someone didn't understand the concept behind your-
Amir - Yeah well I'm gonna make this one my mission, ok! What good would it be to ignore all of these?
Jake - What about every single other one?
Amir - Those are-
Jake and Amir - Goofs.
Jake - Right.
Amir - Yeah, they're goofy.
Amir - 
Jake - So are you going to keep breathing or no?
Amir - Oh what's the point, ok. Each one of these pieces of paper is a tiny little reminder that I'm not good enough. That I gotta change something.
Jake - Then why did you make a suggestion box?
Amir - I was hoping, it would be empty.
Jake - No more suggestions, did you learn anything?
Amir - Yeah, I learned I need a new job, one that's far away from these losers.
Jake - That's fine. That was one of the suggest-
Amir - Yeah you're right, I'll stick it out.
Jake - Didn't say that.
Amir - Whoa, what's that? .
Jake - Get off me!
Amir - Give me your sciss-  So you had scissors.
Jake - Give them back, alright! You always get them sticky.

streeter: Right at the desk?

streeter: I doubt that.
amir: Yea, well I doubted it too, which is why I sent him home for the day, but its up to you if you want to bring him back tomorrow. But as of right now, the way he's acting, my vote is for fuck no.

intro:
amir: Jake you're watching Amir- ah, frig.
jake: Terrible.
amir: Terribly bad maybe.
jake: Right.
amir: Ugh, I don't know how you can eat that garbage.
jake: It's a chicken caesar salad wrap.
amir: Yeah, do you have any idea how they made that lettuce?
jake: On a lettuce farm?
amir: In a friggin test tube? In a lab? On the back of human mice?
jake: I doubt that.
amir: You doubt, that they can grow human ears, on the back of mice?
Ehuheh, heh!
jake: I said I doubt that they can grow lettuce on the back of human mice.
amir: Do you know what a humster is?
jake: I have half an hour for lunch every day, man...
amir: A hybrid cell line made out of hamster oocytes fertilized with male sperm. Ok, that food you're eating might as well be a cockmeat sandwich.
jake: You're an idiot.
amir: Better--I'm a vegan.
jake: Meaning?
amir: Meaning, I don't eat meat, I don't eat wheat, and I don't eat treats, now take a seat.
jake: I'm sitting.
amir: Sitting on a bed of lies, maybe. Deep-throating a cockmeat sandwich, praying to the only god you have that mommy doesn't find out, well guess what?--
jake: Why do you come to work?
amir: Here's a riddle for ya. You know right now you can walk into a Japanese grocery store in downtown Tokyo and buy a cube of watermelon. And I'm not talking about like a cubic watermelon, I'm talking about a legit cube of watermelon. Do you have any idea how unnatural that is?
jake: You do know that's not a riddle right?
amir: No, did you know that right now there's a group of scientists at Monsanto on a lunch break, at a Chipotle for all I care, and when they get back, they're gonna be working on a tomato that's genetically altered to be the size of an apple.
jake: Tomatoes are the size of apples.
amir: NOT cherry tomatoes! And not pizza.
jake: You're not smart, man, alright...
amir: Did you know that tomato paste isn't a glue substitute? Like, you can't use it to glue stuff.
jake: Yes.
amir: Ok, well right now my dad is getting a birthday card that's drenched, unreadable and disgusting.
jake: That one just sounds like you had a bad arts and crafts accident, alright. Why did you have to glue his card shut in the first place?
amir: Turns out I didn't! Thank you very much, meat eater! Ohhhh!
jake: You eat meat! Ok you eat chicken McNuggets constantly--
amir: No no no not in a while.
jake: You're eating one right now.
amir:  Ok, one. And that was a goof, alright. Plus, you never answered my humster question--you know what it is, or not?
jake: Well you told me it was oocytes fert--
amir: OO what? OO what?
jake: OO--
amir: OO you're wrong!
jake: ...
amir: OO you're wrong!

jake: Plank.
amir:  Don't embarrass me.
jake:   Oh god...well, should I come home?...Yeah, Just keep me posted.  
amir: Is everything cool?
jake: No, Man, my cat's sick.
amir: Jesus...Why the vest?  
jake: We have to put her to sleep.
amir: My god...Why the vest though?
jake: It's whatever, it's stupid, I dunno.
amir: Yeah, it's stupid.  It's very stupid.
jake: Man, I've had that cat since I was twelve.
amir: How long have you had the vest for?  Ha.  Should put the vest to sleep, keep the cat alive.
jake: Okay, well, I've had the vest forever, alright?
amir: Forever?  There's still tags in it.
amir: Do you keep the tags in it forever?
jake: No.
amir: Is that like a...thing?
jake: Stop noticing the vest!
amir: I can't not notice the vest, okay?  It's weird that you're wearing a vest.
jake: Okay, well, I had nothing else to wear, alright?  How's that for an excuse?  I was doing laundry today.  Laundry day ha... Man, I remember when I first picked up the cat from the cat store...
amir: What do you mean "nothing else to wear"?  You're already wearing something else; you're wearing the vest over that.  So it's like you're wearing a shirt jeans, that's a thing.
jake: Okay, well, it's a joke.  The vest is a funny joke.
amir: On you?  Like is that a joke on yourself
jake: I don't care what I look like!  I don't give a crud what I wear.
amir: So why're you-why is that top button unbuttoned?    That's clearly a choice, right?
jake: We're putting my childhood pet to sleep and all you can focus on is my cool vest.
amir: I didn't say it was cool.
jake: Sorry, stylish.
amir: I definitely didn't call it stylish.
jake: Okay, well, it doesn't matter 'cause it's comin' off!  
amir: Is that a...is that a watch?  
jake:  No, there's no-there's not watch-head on it so it's just like a band.  
amir: Why...all the effort?  Why're you wearing a leather band?
jake:  Oh my god it's so hard to put a band around your wrist and snap it in.  
amir: I'm saying, like, goin' to the mall, that's like a lot of effort.
jake:  Lots of effort to take a quick bus ride over the GW bridge and you thumb it down  to an Abercromie.  What's hard about that?  And guess what, I didn't pay a friggin' dime 'cause I ganked it!  Ah ha.    Oh, one second.    Hello?...No, there's nothing you can do.  Why could-how-you already couldn't do anything...I understand. 
amir: Is the cat gone?
jake: No, it was Urban Outfitters.  My custom J-Witz dog tags aren't gonna be ready 'till late this afternoon.
amir: Dog tags?
jake:  Yeah, dog tags, like this one.
amir: So you're already wearing one?
jake: Yeah, well you need two!  Or was Justin Timberlake at the 2002 Kid's Choice Awards NOT styling?
jake:  Oh, yeah,  I bet he wasn't fucking Britney Spears.  
amir: So you have two?

INTRO
amir: Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir.
jake: 38 takes but we got there.
amir: Well make it 39, bitch!
amir:  Aw, sheesh! Hey, listen. Can I borrow your phone? I just got beeped.
jake: You have a phone.
amir: Upgraded it. Alright, I'm living in beepersville now.  Oh! That's cherry.
jake: That's not an upgrade.
amir: Alright, ya Steve Jobs f*cker, sorry it's not a frickin' iPad Nano, just give me your phone, I gotta call someone back.
jake: Use your desk phone!
amir: I gotta call this number back 'cause it says 9-1-1 at the end of it which means emergency, okay, and if I don't get back to it soon then it's gonna beep me again anyway!
jake:  Alright, just don't cry!  God, here.
amir:  I just need something.
jake: You cry to get your way like a four-year-old, that's so pathetic. That is ridiculous.
amir:  Yellow? Yes, the doctor speaking. Alright, this is what you need to do, uh, I'm thinking 20 CC's of dialysis administered vaginally. Which is- yeah. No, I- uh- nurse.  I'm sorry, I went to medical school. Alright, I get paid the big bucks to make the boo-boos go away. So, . Talk back again and we'll make it 40 CC's. Alright, make that 60. Great. Alright, 80 CC's, keep talking. Thank you. Alright, bye, 100 CC's. 
jake: Where did you get that beeper?
amir: I didn't get it. Ok, I ganked it.
jake: That's still getting it.
amir: Why, where did you gank yours? Radio shack? You know I'm surprised that you can even talk to me right now with Steve Jobs' balls in your mouth.
jake: You're being really crass today. How did you get a beeper from a doctor's office?
amir: Bachelor party last weekend. Yeah, my friend from high school, Marty's getting married so you know I came to play.  First step is a nice, little brunch with his family and I'm already a little buzzed after three Four Lokos and a shot of schnapps, some bozo jokingly dares me to bite into a glass of orange juice.  Before he even gets to the just kidding I am tooth-deep in the thing. I'm not an idiot, okay, so I think the thing's gonna crack but my eyes widen with fear when the bitch explodes in my mouth. I'm talking razor-sharp glass shards just cutting my mouth up from uvula to incisor, there was blood everywhere. Alright, next thing I know I'm in the back of Donnie's Camaro, he's the best man, and people are just begging me not to fall asleep. I'm laughing maniacally, my face is like a blood-sprinkler, the red liquid's just shooting everywhere, getting on the interior and stuff. To make matters worse I wasn't even invited to the frickin' thing. So I start passing out, you know, Nature's Promise and all.
jake: That's a butter company.
amir: I wake up in post-op four hours later and I needed 31 stitches to close me shut, nurse is livid, just crying in the corner because I've been shitting myself nonstop which sounds standard, but it's not.
jake: Doesn't sound standard.
amir: They choose this golden moment to give me a hospital bill. Uh-oh, daddy doesn't have health insurance. So I book it, alright. Cut to interior, hospital, day, later, I am barreling skull-first into a doctor, right into his chest, and he gets plowed to the floor. Medical equipment everywhere, alright. The beeper falls onto the ground and I just jump on it like a Nazi taking a grenade for his German cohorts. He looks passed out, but I'm not gonna take that risk, okay, so I shove the beeper three inches into my butt and I just take off in a dead sprint due north, remember that direction 'cause it's gonna come in handy later. I'm three towns over before I even realize nobody's chasing me and at that point I'm thanking God because my groin is torn to shreds.
jake: So that beeper was in your butt?
amir: For 14 miles. And the bitch still works.

EPISODE LINK
amir : Hey, you're watching a very special Hallowe'en episode of Jake-
jake : A couple months early, right?
amir: A couple months late
amir: Hey, can you help me out with my bucket list? You know, flesh it out, make it a little longer
jake: I mean it's already really long. If anything it should be shorter.
amir: Yeah, I know. Let me ask you a question. Do you believe in me? 'Cause I just got off of the phone with my dad and he was Just berating me. Half an hour straight. Screaming. I didn't' even get a word in.
jake: Okay, first issue. Uh, there are a lot of duplicates here, like the first nine say "Find treasure".
amir: Really? Because duplicate means two, and you said the first nine are find treasure. So which one is it?
jake: Either way, let's just get rid of all the items that repeat.
amir: Either way, I'm just gonna look up the definition of duplicate and call you out on it. I'm sorry. That is too rich.
jake: Whoa! Mean text from your dad.
amir: Ignore.
jake: You read #124 and tell me if it's something you really want to do.
amir: Eat a cockmeat sandwich panini-style. Extra cockmeat on rosemary focaccia, side of chips and a free soda. It better be free, I'm eating cockmeat after all. No, I guess not. Just white it out.
jake: I'm saying why'd you write cockmeat in the fir-
amir : Liquid paper!
jake: I'm saying why'd you wri-
amir : He had three kids; two of them are doctors and one's a royal pain in the ass, so that's not my fault. It's called not knowing how to raise yo' kids.
jake : Here's one that's not on here that maybe should be. Do volunteer work.
amir: Yeah, I already have that. Okay? Check 419.
jake: No, 419 is what made me think of it because you wrote: "You don't owe the world a f***ing dime." That's not even a thing you can do, alright? That's just a mean idea to have.
amir: Okay, it's called I was carsick.
jake : What?
amir : Here we go, definition. Okay. Duplicate: a copy or replica of - okay, never mind. This is a hack website.
jake: dictionary.com?
amir: theonion.com?!
jake: A lot of these are really conflicting.
amir: What do you mean?
jake: Okay, 91: Write a novel.
amir: Okay.
jake: #92: Set fire to a small, independently owned bookstore. Don't look back.
amir: Okay.
jake: #93: Don't ever look back.
amir: Right.
jake: 94: Give one glance, to make sure it's really happening. This is your moment. #95: Soak it in, you've earned one glance. #96: F*** it! Turn around fully and behold. You've earned this. Months of planning. It's all happening. Feel the warmth. 97: Tweet the picture, you've earned one tweet. Tweet a picture of you next to the fire holding up a shocker. Defiant and proud. This is your moment.
amir: Right, ninety-s-ninety-eight tho-

amir: Exactly.
jake: This one's kinda nice. Climb to the top of the Eiffel Tower.
amir: Yeah, well read the next one.
jake: Start punching French women until their mustaches fall off.
amir: Yeah. And you can delete it, because I've already done it.
jake: Put a cherry bomb in a mailbox?
amir: Ever heard of "because I was carsick"?
jake: Yeah, you said it like a minute ago and it didn't make sense. Maybe that's like an excuse that worked once before and you keep using it?
amir: Just pull over man.
jake: Gotcha...
jake: Your last page is just an index.
amir: Exactly, it sort of categorizes all the items. You know, makes them easier to find.
jake: Okay, but you filed them all under-
jake and amir: Miscellaneous!
amir: Which means-
jake: Ss- I'm talking. You filed them all under miscellaneous except for #99, which you filed under odds and ends.
amir: So, okay. So what's 99?  So 91, 92...
jake: It's down here at the bottom, just chill out. I got it, okay? You- you said 99: Perfect! Why did you look back? Everything was going perfect. The bookstore was en fuego-
amir : On fire, in spanish.
jake: I know. Stop touching it, alright?
amir : I know.
jake: You were golden and you looked back. You made this about you. You're weak.

INTRO Amir - Jake and Amir's Get Together Project.
jake: What's happening?
amir: What's hap--What isn't happening, man? Look at this. This is not good. People are not getting together enough, all right? We all need to reconnect!
jake: No, like why did you have that map made?
amir: OK, right, just focus. So--
jake: I specifically told you not to have anybody make a map. I said it would be too expensive.
amir: You think this is too expensive? What do you think about those twelve bean bags, huh, man? You think those were cheap?
jake: And those fourteen water coolers I passed in the kitchen?
amir: Eighteen.
jake: Those were also yours?
amir: Yeah, it's to encourage discourse, communication, right? Let's say I go to your desk area, right, and I want to borrow a fricking stapler or whatever.
jake: Stop saying fricking.
amir: Anyway, I go to your desk area and suddenly we're having a water cooler moment, right? So check this out. Hey, what's up dude? Whoa, I love your shirt.
jake: Thank you.
amir: It is amazing.
jake: That's enough.
amir: It's incredibly soft, but not in a too soft way where it's like effeminate, but it's just super, super nice.
jake: Yeah, that's good.
amir: See? We had a moment. Me, you, your awesome shirt.
jake: OK, enough about the shirt! But I do like what you're doing here.
amir: You do?
jake: Yeah, you're making an effort, right? That's what it's all about.
amir: Exactly! OK, you're going to love this next idea. Every hour, at like eighty past--
jake: Not a time.
amir: Well, hear me out, a soothsayer is going to appear right over there--
jake: Wow. A soothsayer, right over there?
amir: Yes, so he's just going to come up clouded in smoke and we're all just going to emerge next to him, chanting, being all sort of- our psyches mingling.
jake: That's going to happen every hour?
amir: Yeah. At eighty past the hour, of course.
jake: That sounds like that might be a little too much.
amir: Are you sure? I mean, I already booked him, he's pretty cool.
jake: Yeah, I think we're good.
amir: He's going to hate this.
amir: See? Pretty good, right?
jake: Not too bad man, not at all. You know what? I'm going to tell you where I bought this shirt.
amir: Wow. I am... honestly so happy I could cry.

intro:
amir: Jake and Amir's Get Together Project!
[Amir sits down at his desk across from Jake.)
amir: Eughh. Elevators, man, right? 
jake: I told you not to talk to me for the rest of the day.
amir: I was just in an elevator, ok, and nobody was looking at anyone. It was really uncomfortable!
jake: Do you still do that thing where you enter the elevator backwards?--
amir: Yeah! You know, so I'm facing the RIGHT way in case of emergency; it's just a safety precaution.
jake: Alright well people don't wanna look at each other in elevators; it's sort of uncomfortable.
amir: So I try to break the silence; you know, add a little warmth and comradery to this otherwise awkward elevator ride. You n- wanna know what I said?
jake: Something about the weather?
amir: No, that's boring. Ok I wanted to do something that they would REMEMBER me by. So I asked them, straight up, if you had to choose, which one would you rather have: eight legs, or two really long, eight-foot arms.
jake:  Like, telescopic, noodley arms?
amir: Yeah, just like giant noodles for arms.
jake: Giant noodle arms.
amir: Yeah.
jake: Or what was the other one? Eight legs?
amir: Eight legs like a spider.
jake: Wow. Yeah.. that's stupid.
amir: Exactly, right? Difficult question; I don't even know which one--
jake: I said stupid.
amir: Yeah, well it is very difficult. Which one would you rather have?
jake: Look, I said it was a stupid question, not in intelligent question; you're taking what I'm saying and turning it around--
amir: Eight legs. Hm. I knew you'd take their side.
jake:  How was the reaction?
amir: Muted. Mm-hmm. Lotta noise; lotta noise.
jake: Do you know what muted means?
amir: Yes. Well, now I do.
amir: What is with elevators, ok why is it so uncomfortable in there? Why is nobody allowed to talk to anybody?  What is it, like a library in there? I'm gonna check out a book, in an elevator?
jake: You trying to do a stand up act, or something?
amir:  HOW can we break the ice.. in elevators, ok? We wanna know! ...So submit your answers right here! 
outro:
amir: People! Let's get closer!
jake: Join our Get Together Project at Facebook.com/BACARDI
amir: So why'd you choose legs, man? I was like positive you were an arm guy.
jake: AhhI dunno.
amir: Think about it, ok? I don't wanna just talk to hear the sound of my own voice, I want you to put something back--
jake: That's what you usually do anyway.
amir: How dare you accuse me of talking on and on and on, with no seeming reason or rhyme to where I'm going, or how--
jake: You see what you're doing now?

amir: Interior, Office, Day. The year is 2011.
jake: Outta time.
amir: Okay
amir:  Hey.
jake: I don't like it.
amir: I haven't even told you what it is yet!
jake: Is it the voice?
amir: Barely, it's just a subtle change. I'm surprised you even realised it.
jake: It's not.
amir: Subtle but much better.
jake: It's neither. God, you look really weird when you talk like that, too.
amir: What are you trying--, this is my--, this is how I talk. This is natural for me, okay? I've been trying to talk like a high-pitched fool for the last four years.
jake: That's not natural.  You make this face, how is this is a natural thing?
pat: Whoa, Jake, cool voice!
jake: Thanks.
amir: No!
jake: Yeah! Yes. A million times yes, okay? This is mine now.
amir: I'm begging you not to do this.
jake: Beg all you want, ok? You don't get a voice this chill and just give it up.
amir: This has gone from being the best day of my life to the second-worst, easily.
jake: Don't be a baby, dude. You're acting like I'm telling you to stop doing the voice. We can both do it.
amir: Then people are gonna think I stole it from you!
jake: Let them think what they want!
amir: No! You're not-- are you really not even gonna clarify that--
jake: I'm not gonna get down there like a fucking dog--
amir: --not a dog!--
jake: Yes, like a dog!
amir: Not a dog!
jake: Not gonna get down in the ground like a goddamn puppy to clarify for people, alright? Let them think that you stole it. It's honestly better for me.
amir: Yeah, I--. I've never s--. You're being so mean right now. If you're gonna steal it and not clarify that you stole it from me when people accuse you of stealing it, at least admit that you're being mean right now.
jake: Listen man, I know. I'll be the first to admit it's a dick move.
amir: Yeah, I was the first to admit it.
jake: No, it's a dick move. I'm well aware of that.
amir: I--. Yeah, well.
jake: I'm sorry, I'm sorry, But what would you do in my position, if you had a voice this chill?
amir: I would keep the voice
jake: Obviously.
amir: But I would clarify that if people thought that you stole it--
jake: No. No. You're saying that because that's what you want. Not 'cause that's what you'd do in my position. Ok? You gotta learn how to empathize man.
amir: 
jake: Don't, don't. Come on, that's not even crying.
amir: What are you--
jake: What? Yeah, I can lose the voice and then pick it back up. Doesn't mean shit.
amir: You're not even doing it right.
jake: Oh, I'm doing it right because this is my voice and you stole it from me. Ok? My voice rules, your voice drools, how's that for fair?
pat: Jake, I was being sarcastic. It's not a cool voice.
jake: Uhm, no slit bitch. I know, I like my regular voice just fine, thank you.
amir: So, I can keep--
jake: I reserve the right to take it back, okay? Pending a second opinion. No offense, Pat, but you're a little bit of bitch, too.
intro:
jake: You're watching Jake and Amir!
amir: That's what she said!
jake: Not how that joke works.
amir: EHH!
~~~~
amir: So, the beeper is just sliding down my thigh, and I'm still facing, remember that direction, due north? Guess what? I was lying. It was due south. How's that for a mind fudge? So, I s...
jake: Hey, hey. I just got this e-mail that you sent to the entire company and, um, nobody's going to believe you're doing a triathlon for charity.
amir: Ooh, this kitten's got claws. He he.
jake: Right, so they're not going to donate any money to you.
amir: Rerh!  He he. Rerh. He he. ...Why not?
jake: For starters, you began the e-mail by saying Dear Suckers.
amir: Yea, as in deer suckers. Like little possums.
jake: So, that makes even less sense than I originally thought. Secondly, triathlons are running, swimming and biking, not drinking, fucking and stealing ya'lls cash.
amir: Cash money, ain't nothin funny.
jake: That's not a response to what I just said.
amir: Fo'sho!
jake: Look, even if they get past the beginning of this e-mail, the next part is a picture of you in a jewelry store, holding a diamond watch, with the caption: I want dis.
amir: You don't understand, man. I want dis.
jake: That's the only thing I understand.
amir: Ok! If you don't want to make the donation just put in like $150 and then click send. And when goes Are you sure you want to make the donation? click on No. If it's that hard, i'll do...i'll click on it.
jake: I just got a follow-up e-mail: It's come to my attention that you guys think this is a bogus goof. I legit want/need dis watch. Blew your cover there. Then, three follow up e-mails that say: Please disregard, please disregard, please disregard. One more, though. Just one sentence long and it says: Come on, douches. Help out the cause. And it's a photo shopped picture of you shitting on Bill Cosby.
amir: That was a Jello pudding snack.
jake: That was a Jello pudding snack, ok. It's kinda weird, though, that you have a legit picture of you taking a shit.
amir: Yea, the Cos loves his Jello pudding sweaters.
jake: Final e-mail: Please recall all e-mails. Somebody's being a bitch. And it's a photo shopped picture of Bill Cosby shitting on me, which is extra weird because you somehow got a photo of Bill Cosby taking a shit?
amir: The Cos has to poop, eventually, sir. And it's just about finding the right f...
jake: How are you so fast at photo shop?
amir: It's all about doing it real crudely and quickly.
jake: Not very crudely. They're fine lines.
amir: Yea, the trick is to make it look like it's very good, but it's actually not that good.
jake: You gotta stop it with that impression.
amir: Yea, well at least I don't spit when I talk!
jake: Do I do that?
amir: No! And for that I am thankful. Namaste.
jake: One last thing, alright? One final thing. Your shirt is up around your nipples. Pull it all the way down when you put it on. Alright?
jake: You get it over your head. Your arms are through the holes. That's good. Put it all the way down.
jake: It's not..it's still...it's half-way!

amir: No, I'm recording intros.
jake: Leave, man.
amir : laughing Right in the kisser.
jake: Hey, um...
amir : Hold on one second... What?
jake: a lot of people have been complaining to me.
amir: And you believe them?!
jake: I haven't said what it is yet.
amir: Okay, I set up a spy cam in the women's restroom. Sue me.
jake: Wow. They might.
amir: Okay, then I'll countersue. How's that? Two sues for the price of one.
jake: It's about your stench.
amir: Or lack thereof. laugh
jake: No, not a lack thereof, exactly what I said. Okay? You reek of shit.
amir: Jealous much?
jake: I'm not jealous. Look, this isn't going away, alright? You smell like you're dead.
amir: I'll apologize, but I'm not gonna shower.
jake: That's not good enough, then. We all want the exact opposite.
amir: I said I was sorry!
jake: First of all you didn't, second of all we don't want your apology, we want you to take a shower.
amir: Okay, this is catching me way off guard.
jake: Is it really? Because last week a bunch of people chased you with a hose and soap.
amir: I thought that was a goof!
jake: Why would that be a goof? You whispered something to Sarah and she got an ear infection.
amir: Alright, you think I give a flaming fart what people say, man?
jake: I know you don't. Don't do that.
amir: Oh, no! Oh, anyhoot!
jake: No! No! Not anyhoot, okay? You have to go change your pants now.
amir: Why, 'cause I farted? Wow. It was a toot. An SBD, so NBD, on NBC  laughs
jake: You leaked shit into your khakis.
amir: Yeah, ever heard of I'll clean it after work? So shut up.
jake: No. I haven't ever heard of  sharting your pants, with wet diarrhea, and then waiting a full five hours to clean it up, okay? That is the first time I've ever heard of that.
amir: Losers wipe, okay? Winners go home and f*** the prom queen.
jake: You're not gonna f*** anybody. It looks like you sat on a water balloon filled with chili.
amir: Okay, you think I give a flaming fart-
jake: Oh my god, it smells like gasoline and fish.
Jake and Amir Oscar Pool
jake: Hey, you're watching Jake and-
amir: Cut!
jake: What?
amir: I cut myself so I'm yelling it!
jake: Oh
amir: Filling out your Oscar pool huh? Well my picks are so hot, it's Jacuzzi.
jake: I heard you rehearsing that line for a full five minutes outside the door.
amir: No. Hey, here's a crazy, sexy, fun idea! Let's rob the organiser of this pool huh? Just gank that envelope filled with the cash by-ins and sprint due-north right to New Jersey-
jake: I'm the organiser.
amir: In german accent I'm ze organizer. What are you, friggin Arnold Schwarzenegger? *attacks Jake *
jake: Hey!
amir: Oh, Pat said you do a good 'the fighter' impression.
jake: In accent I'm the one fighting here, not you, not you and not you.
amir: Okay, Pat was wrong.
jake: Well, that was it.
amir: Well, it blew. Colin Firth, more like Colin lasht, I think he's the firsht pershon with a shpeech impediment to win the Oshcar.
jake: You're saying so many dumb things at once, it's crazy.
amir: My picks are so hot, it's Jacuzzi.
jake: You know you said that already.
amir: Not the exact same way okay, so I took a risk, I said it again. Big whoop.
jake: You actually did say it the exact same way.
amir: What would you know about risk man? You've been oohing and aahing about Sarah over the past three years but you don't have the huevos rancheros  to ask her out do ya? You don't have the balls!
jake: In accent I want Dickie and I want you Charlie.
amir: It's fine, okay, I said it was fine.
jake: You didn't say it was fine, you said it was shitty so I did it again.
amir: My picks are so hot, it's Jacuzzi.
jake: Hey, man alright it's funny just please don't say it anymore. Fine you do it, you're so good, you do it.
amir: In accent I'm the one fighting here, not you, not you and not you.
jake: Hah! Bull Spit, that was terrible. Take the hand... In accent I'm the one fighting here, not you, not you and not you-
amir: I was doing it with the hand motion if you think it's-
jake: Alright, fine. How about this for a fighter impression, I punch you in the head!
amir: Hey here's an idea, let's share our answers and then we can split the winnings.
jake: That's not something you should want to happen.
amir: Then we can get something together like a booze cruise.
jake: Okay, why don't you just go on a booze cruise by yourself.
amir: Because it's a frickin' cock meat convention, it's just dudes. Hey can you do me a favour and read this e-mail from my dad and tell me if there's one thing that you can think of that he doesn't call me out on.
jake: Wow, long e-mail. Can you hold your phone steady?
amir: I'm trying to!
jake: You're scrolling too fast. Alright, this is a small thing to bring up I know but I've never seen your phone with more than 8% battery.
amir: Yeah, usually I only charge it for like 10 minutes a day.
jake: That's not enough.
amir: Well, what I need is like a power grid. You just put the phone on there over night and forget it.
jake: How do you think normal chargers work?
amir: Will you take me to a sky mall if I pay you?
jake: Done! You?
amir: Almost! You?
jake: You're not almost done, you haven't circled one thing but you know what it doesn't matter cause I'm gonna win, not you, not you and not you.
amir: Give it up!
jake: Alright, fuck you man! Have you seen the movie? Have you even seen it?! Because I was at my cousin's bachelorette party right and I was doing the impression non-stop pretty much and everybody there was drunk yeah but they told me it was deec.
jake: I need Dickie and I need you Okeef.
pat: Yeah, it's pretty good.
jake: Fuck pretty good man! Last week you told me it was great!
pat: Yeah it's great I'm sorry.
jake: You should have said that the first time man.
amir: It does seem less genuine now that you said it after he yelled at you.
INTRO
amir:  Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir.
jake: Cool, good job.
amir: I know it kills you to see me doing so well.
amir: Oh, by the dubs, who won the Oscar pool?
jake: You mean the one that I organized, that I set up?  Uh-oh, spaghetti sauce.  I did.
amir: Hehehe, why uh-oh?
jake: Oh, cuz everybody's gonna be all like oh wait, you collected all the money. Um. What's that about?, you know?  Haters gonna hate, players gonna play.
amir: Hehe...you just, you said you were gonna send out an email with how everyone did, and you never did. So..
jake:  Go on, take the money and run.
amir: Hahahahaha.
jake:  Go on, take the money -   I forgot to send out the email. I did. But trust me, there's no trickery afoot.  I did not make sexual steals with that Oscars. That's a campaign promise.
amir: I never said you stole or cheated or any-
jake: Good, cuz I didn't. And i have the text to prove it.
amir: Okay.  Not that you cheated, what text though?
jake: My sister texted me congratulations AFTER she found out that I won the Oscar pool.  That's how you know my picks were locked in. Otherwise, why would she be proud of me?
amir: What??
jake: What? A but? In your butt? Oh my goodness. Ah. Ah. Ah.
amir: Hahaha. Let me see the text.
jake: Here's a question, I won enough money last night to legit hire a hit man to kill you.  Is that scary?
amir: I guess so, I mean, is that even true? You won like 200 dollars.
jake: Yeah, but I won second place too.
amir: How- You said everyone could only submit one, right?
jake: Yeah, and you said you weren't gonna be a little bitch today. But looks like everyone's breaking their promises left and right.  Okay, you owe me another 20 bucks, by the way.
amir: Why?
jake: Losing fee!
amir: I already paid you 20 dollars to enter.
jake: Yeah, to enter!  That's the entrance fee! You owe me a losing fee!
jake: Don't cry. You're gonna owe me a 50 dollar bitch fee if you cry.
amir:  I can't afford the bitch fee.
jake: You be - ohmygod, you're being such a bitch.
streeter: Ooh, guys, what's uh, what's going on?
jake: Amir's crying cuz I futt-bucked  him at the Oscar pool.
amir: No.
streeter: Oh yeah! The Oscar pool!  You never sent that email, man. How'd I do?
jake: On a scale of one to third?
streeter: Yeah.
jake: You didn't. Okay? Sorry.
streeter: Oh. okay. Well, how'd you do, then?
jake: Oh, I uh...uh...uh...uh...CAME, in first, second AND turd. As in, you guys need to learn how to be funny.
amir: Ok, I'm trying!
streeter: K, I want my money back, Jake.
jake: Ok, sorry bro, I actually already spent it on these boots.
amir: Those are actually pretty tight.
jake:  Namaste.
streeter: Okay, you bought those boots ten days ago, man.  The day AFTER you collected my money for the Oscar picks.
jake:  These boots are made for f**king.   That's just what they'll do.  One of these days these boots are gonna skeet  all over you, oh!

hoodie: Most of your words were out.

Intro
a: Yo, this is my love song, and it goes like -
j:  No more rap intros.
a: Fine...
a: Hey, thanks ASIAN for the invite last night! 
j: That's really offensive.
a: I just really needed to get out of the house, so I appreciate it.
j: Okay, well I'm still pretty pissed at you about last night.
a:  ...Is this like an inside joke based on something that happened, because I'm sorry, I was a little bit gone.
j: You were ENTIRELY gone, okay? You showed up three hours late and you were begging to the point of tears to change the locashe.
a: Yeah, I say a LOT of funny things.
j: It wasn't funny. You openly wept for a venue change for my friend's birthday party at her apartment to a quote college dive around the corner from this shithole.
a: I thought the party needed a new energy, okay?!  Sometimes nights are about what kind of energy you're able to infuse -
j:  Right, no, no, no, I get that, but the party had a fine energy, right? They were lighting the birthday candles and then you blew them all out and you said Happy birthday to pee! and then you whipped out your penis and tried to urinate on the cake - but couldn't -
a:  I had just drained the main vein...like 25 seconds earlier.
j: Okay, I'm not upset that you couldn't pee, I'm upset that you tried. Then you ran outside and a few of us followed you because you yelled I'm gonna go outside and legit hurt myself to teach you all a fucking lesson.
a: A lot of the girls last night were slumpbusters, can we talk about THAT for a second?
j: Not right now, okay? Once we were outside you asked my friend if she dared you to headbutt the windshield of a car until it broke. When she said no, you took off in a dead sprint and said You owe me five bucks, you sasquatch! and then you lowered your head and ran full speed into the bumper of a truck.
a: That reminds me; that slumpbusting sasquatch owes me a five-spot. An Abe Lincolner.
j: We heard a DEAFENING crack - like a log being broken over a rock - and you fell completely motionless to the ground. We thought you had broke your neck.
a:  You probably think, you think you're cooler than me.
j: ...your legs didn't work anymore after that, so you started scooting down the street on your butt, screaming I'm Lieutenant Dan! See if you can keep up with me, ya GUMPS!, but you were moving like, 2 inches every minute.
a:  ...no...
j: Yes, okay?! Is this the first time you're getting a little embarrassed?
j: Okay, I'm gonna keep on going...Okay, you whipped out your penis ONE more time; you said, follow my trail of pee to victory, but once again, you could not produce any urine -
a:  I HAD JUST DRAINED -
j:  The main vein. No, I remember that. Do you remember the skateboarder that rode by? He saw your penis and laughed at you?
a:  ...Vaguely?
j: You started crying? You said, Let's see your guido dick! I have a big penis and you have a string beanis!
a:  I'm sorry, is there a point to this story?
j: You asked me why I was mad.
a:  Why don't you ask me why I'M mad, okay?! You take me to a slumpbuster festival, I haven't gotten any in like weeks - I'm on a 2-month dry spell - and EVERYBODY is outta my league.
j:  You just said it was a slumpbuster festival, now they're out of your league?
a: THEY'RE BOTH, OKAY. I'm a 1, and they're 3s!!
j: Just stop for one second and listen to me.
a:  No, you stop and listen to PEE.
j: ...Nothing.
a:  I just drained the main vein like a DAY ago. On a CAKE, lest you forget.

jake: You're watching Jake and Amir.
amir: No doubt!
jake: Not cool.
amir: I know.
jake : Hey, any luck on the uh- soap or the body wash? I sent you you some links on Amazon.
amir: Yeah, no man. But get this, I was cleaning out my desk earlier and found this IOU that you wrote.
jake : I'm gonna go to lunch.
amir : W-w-wait. Okay? I'm talking' to you!
jake: What?
amir: What! Do me the courtesy of looking me in my eye!
jake: What do you want?
amir: 1875 bucks, man. Huh? Plus shipping. Okay, a little less if it's in the continental US, which last time I checked, my internet wasn't hooked up, so I couldn't find the answer.
jake: So let me get this straight. You were cleaning out your desk, which judging by the shit-stained khakis that are still right there, you've never actually done. And you found an IOU for the exact amount of that blow your own glass studio that you just bought on eBay?
amir: It's a coincidence, to be sure.
jake: What is this? 
amir: It's a salute!
jake: You're never gonna get your shit together to actually set that up and learn how to blow you own glass. Okay, here's a tip, don't take up any hobbies until you've learned how to wash yourself.
amir: Alright, you're not getting a Mason jar.
jake: You need a coal burning oven, by the way. If you want to blow you own glass you need to buy a coal burning oven.
amir: Alright, how 'bout this. You give me the 1875 or I blackmail ya.
jake: With what?
amir: With what, Isn't blackmail alone bad enough? Now you want to know with what? How about I punch ya, man. Or you wanna know with what?
jake: Just try to get out of buying the glass studio.
amir : Mickey my friend, how are you? Ha ha! Yes. Long time, no time. I believe I'm going to have to pass on that glass studio. Yes, I'm going to have to pass on that glass, as they say. Laughs Yeah, my associate actually informs me that you need a coal burning oven which, you didn't quite tell me about, Mickey. You misled me Mickey, and I'm a little offended. Let me tell you something about myself, my friend: I do not cut corners. This is how I do it, yes on the glass studio, throw in an oven. Okay, if I'm going to do this, and I'm going to do this, then I can't start cutting corners on an oven Mickey. laughs The cheque? The cheque- I just handed the cheque off to the postman right now.  hand it off to a postman, hand it off to a fricki-
jake: Mickey he's lying to you!
amir : My god, man! That is amaz- I'm writing a new song and that would be a perfect chorus!
jake: A new song? What's your old song?
amir : Mickey's lyin' an old man is dyin' and nobody's cryin' but you Mickey! Mickey! Mickey! Mickey! So...
jake: That's awful.
streeter: Dude, I really really liked that. What is-
jake: Yeah, well I wrote it! I gave him the chorus, which I know is your favorite part!
streeter: Well, not mumble not really.
amir and streeter : Mickey! Mickey! Mickey!
jake: You're gonna say I didn't write that? How about this, I would love to make you a vase. I'll cut you an 1875 cheque right now if you give me one guitar lesson.
amir : Mickey! Mickey!
amir: No no no!
jake: I was getting it! It's my song! It's my song, I don't have to listen to you do it!
streeter: Jake! Come on, let him play.
amir : Here we go, ready? Mickey! Mickey!
amir: Don't sing!

jake: You said PU and plugged your nose.
amir:  Yeah.. because- Oh, that's cuz I smell.
jake: Hey, maybe don't submit a bracket this year. Just because every single year you--
amir: Why would I not submit a bracket this year?
jake: I'm in the middle of telling you!
amir: Whoah...---
jake: Every year, you call the organizer the night before the finals and you threaten to sue them for gambling if they don't give you your five dollars back.
amir: Who pissed in your toilets?
jake:  Don't touch my leg.
amir:  Ohkee--
jake: Don't touch--  No. No!
amir: Aand.. done.  I think it's called March Madness because if I'm not winning, it's madness. 
jake: Nope.
amir:  Nope. Nope. Wow. Yugh, you're suck an idiot! How 'bout trying to laugh with me for once? You're constantly doing stuff like Wow, Oh, you're so stupid. Huh? That's not very constructive! You're just tearing me down! How 'bout laughing with me! That's more fun! Cuz you know what, at the end of the day, I'm saying a lot of stupid stuff, but I'm smiling, I'm having a good time, and you're not; you're miserable. Congratulations, you're taking the easy route.

ben: I said a lot of things, I ate all those Funyuns, I didn't throw them out. You ready? Take off your clothes.
jake:  Hey, hey, stop, look. If he blindly follows your instructions, just tell him to shower.

EPISODE LINK
amir: Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir. Alright, how was that bitch?
jake: You just ruined it!
jake: laughs Oh, that does make sense because the subway wasn't running today.
amir: Yeah, I know. I was just down there and I pressed the emergency breaks, you know? Which brings the whole thing to like a standstill. And we were stuck down there for like... a day. laughs
jake: Yes! I remember you came up above ground finally and everyone was chanting Asshole!
amir : Yeah, that's not the first time that's happened. laughs
jake: Whoa...
amir: Yeah, third grade talent show, decided to do standup comedy but my material was a little... raunchy. laughs I was booed off the stage, but my dad was so embarrassed that he moved.
jake: Alright, that's sad, but I was talking about the makeup.
amir: What?
jake: You're putting powder on your face.
amir: Yeah. I have oily skin. It's a greasy t-zone.
jake: Do you wash your face?
amir: Don't need to. laughs I just use the powder.
jake: Then you do need to wash you-
amir : The trick is to make it look like you're not wearing a lot.
jake: That's the trick for girls. The trick for guys is just to never wear any makeup.
amir : Alright, lemme tell you a story. In sixth grade, I was bullied so hard that my dad almost moved. Instead, my teacher called a parental mediation session. So it was just me and my dad, the tormenter and the tormenter's foster mom. They all ganged up on me so hard, that my dad moved.
jake: Sorry, your dad ganged up on you so hard that he moved?
amir : Yes.
jake: How does this relate to oily skin?
amir: It doesn't relate to oily skin. Okay? I just wear makeup, alright? Maybe you should care about your personal appearance too. You might look a little better.
jake: Stand up!
jake: Turn around!
jake: Great! I just wanted to make sure I was getting fashion advice from the guy who shit his pants three weeks ago and has yet to clean them.
amir: Ooh! Easy fix! 
jake: That's not- No! That doesn't fix it.
amir: Says the guy who got his pubes waxed everyday for like a month.
jake: I didn't do that.
amir: I'm talking about me. And you know what? I developed such a bad rash after my 30th full brazilian in as many days that you know what my dad did?
jake: Moved?
amir: He frickin' moved!
introduction:
jake: Hey you're watching Jake and... Will you please start wearing pants to these.
amir:Relax.
amir:  Thank you so much. Honestly, I mean I don't know what you do with this money but it's like yours to keep.
jake: Yo, what's going on?
amir: None ya!
amir: You're not curious to know what that means? None ya. It's a new word.
jake: I already know what you're gonna say.
amir: None ya business!
jake: Right, got it. Why are you paying these teenagers money?
amir: First of all, okay, they're not teenagers. They're all fifteen years old.
jake: Then they're teenagers.
amir:  You guys lied to me.
jake: They didn't lie to you okay, you misconstrued that.How do you know them?
amir: They were in second grade uh, when I was in second grade, so .
jake: How? They're half your age?
amir: I was held back. Constantly, if you must know. Eight straight years in second grade before I decided to turn it on. Alright, I flip it on like a light switch. I'm powering through third, fourth, fifth grade, sixth grade comes along, I open my stupid little trap, and the hammer comes down!
jake: So you didn't talk for four years?
amir: Not a peep! Alright, but then they find out that my reading is still at a second grade level and my math just isn't there.
jake: So it sounds like you didn't turn it on.
amir: Yeah, turns out I just left it off. They shipped me back to second grade with my tail between my legs and every teacher in the hallway just booing me. I spent another nine and a half spottin' second grade. I didn't say a peep the entire time! But hey, at this point, they're already hip to that game so they just keep me there.
jake: So you didn't talk for ten years?
amir: Not a peep.
jake: Stop saying peep.
amir: Mum was the fricken' peep.
jake: That's enough. I don't know what you guys are doing here but you all can just go home alright, peace out .
teenager 1: That's not cool.
jake:  This isn't cool? Alright dude, I'll stop doing it.
amir: They're tutoring me.
jake: They're tutoring you? Okay, yeah, and my shirts grey .
teenager 2: Your shirt is grey.

teenager 1: It's the same thing.
jake: Who are you man? Alright look, either way he's not gonna get it.
teenager 3: Come on Amir! You can do it!
jake: Woah, woah, woah! Foul on the play! No doing that dude. You can't encourage him. He's got to do it himself.
teenager 1: He is.
jake: Not with you guys smiling at him, believing in him, saying  Oh Amir, come on you can do it! You coddle him like a child. It's pathetic.
amir: Oh, 64!
jake:  Bravo. Bravo. You guys tutored him to cheat, with a calculator under the desk.  AH! Oh, no. Ow! Okay, no calculator under there but ay, who left this desk here? Haha.  I'm gonna vomit.
teenager 1: You should lie down.

INTRO Jake - You're watching Jake and Amir!
Amir -  Yes you are! Yes you are!
Jake - They're not babies.
jake: Nope. You missed it. You hit your glasses again.
amir: Yeah. Hey, do you have someone you could set me up with, like on a date?
jake: Um. I don't know, man.
amir: Just. I'm lonely and horny, so.
jake: OK, Definitely not.
amir: OK, I've been on 5 dates in my life man. All right? The first one ended up insanely well but there's no way in hell she's ever going to go out with me again.  Two of the girls I gave pink eye to.  Fourth one, she ended up super, super pissed, but not at me. Fifth one, I really cannot for the life of me remember, oh right! No, you know what?  You killed her with a bus!
jake: I di--I don't want to set you up with any of my friends, OK? Sorry.
amir: OK, are you afraid of me not being me on the date? Like me not being real, because I assure you, I will be there, it will be me, full throttle. Love me or hate me, you gotta love me.
jake: All right.  I'm the girl.  Let's say we're on the date right now. Where have you taken me?
amir: Here's something cute and quirky.  Let's order dessert first. Haha, that's weird, I'm different.
jake: OK, you're trying too hard. Why don't you tell me about some of your hobbies.
amie: All right, let's just be frank, all right? I want one thing, and one thing only. A one night stand. Only at the end of the night, we won't be standing. I want to lay down and hug you.
jake: That's sad.  Tell me about where you grew up.
amir: A lot of girls don't like guys that kiss and tell. Well, let me be frank with you, yet again, sweetheart. I never kiss, and always tell.  I keep telling people how much I've never kissed.
jake: Do you realize you haven't answered a single one of my questions?
amir: And at the conclusion of the night, we walk home, I rub my hand against the dirty park bench, and just start rubbing your eyes.
jake: So, the pink eye thing.  It's kind of a miracle the other 3 dates didn't get it.
amir: Yeah, well they probably did.
jake: All right, well like I said, I don't know anyone who would want to go out with you.
amir: Sorry. Is this still in character, like we're on the date?
jake: No.
amir:  What do you mean, no?
jake: I mean, I don't want to do this anymore.
amir: Is this why you invited me to this restaurant? To embarrass me in front of everyone? You slut!
jake: I don't want to play this game!
amir: OK, this isn't a game, baby. This is me! All right, my heart is exposed right now and you can either tear it out, or s- or say yes and make me the happiest man ever.
jake: We're not really breaking up.
amir:  Thank gosh, promise?  I swear, all I want to do is lay down and hug.

jake:  First of all, thank you guys for donating.
amir: Yes, very cool, very cool.
jake: Very cool, very cool indeed. So thank you again.
amir: Yes, rock on.
jake:  I feel like you're trying not to say thank you.
amir: Well they didn't do anything for me!
amir:  We wanted to give a little love to those who donated more, so if you donated less than five dollars, you guys are rock stars, keep kickin' butt, every dollar counts, but: please press stop now.   Alright, those cheap bastards are gone, so--
jake: Hey, what are you doing?--
amir:  Our boss forced us to do this!
jake: He does not speak for me!--
amir: Against our will!
jake: He doesn't speak for me.
amir: When CollegeHumor recently said they wanted to help with Japan relief, I said count me in, what can I do to help?.
jake: Actually you said what's going on in Japan? Sorry, I DVR the news and I'm a year behind.
amir: Ok, don't you think Conan's being kind of a douche about this whole Jay Leno thing? I mean, all the guy wants is his show back.
amir: If every one of you doubles what you've donated already, we can give twice as much,, to charity.
jake:  Well, they've already donated.
amir:  Well, when it comes to giving you can never give enough, so double what you've given, so we--
jake: Ok but they have given; they gave; that's ok--
amir: Well, give more, specifically double as much--
jake: How much money did you give?
amir: Didn't need to. Making the video.
jake: You're barely doing that.  You're doing a bad job.
amir:  Tonight, I'm gonna have myself a real good time, I--
jake: Sorry, do you think we stopped making the charity video?
amir: This is.. it-- for them, ok? It's a gift!
amir: Ok I'm sorry but it's sixty-one degrees out right now, and Al Gore is complaining about Global Warming. Something doesn't add up, right?
jake: Ok you're pretty far behind in the news, huh? And sixty-one degrees IS pretty warm, for March, in New York--
amir: I just hope he doesn't win this recount, I mean I'm sorry, aeaheha --
jake: Wow, you're further behind than I thought!
jake:  Where did I go wrong, she lost a friend, somewhere along in the bitterness, and I, would have stayed u--
amir: We're good. Hey! We already have my song, that's enough.
amir: From Jake  and Amir , thanks again .
jake: Don't do that man, that really freaks me out, ok I'm Jake, you know that, right?--
amir: Well we can both be Jake..  for a day! 
jake: Oh my God that's exactly what I'm talking about, it's really creepy.

jake: --OOH my God!  Rick Fox?
rick:  You gotta learn how to be ready, man!

rick:  Up top, Amir! 
amir:  Uhahah he got me too!
rick:  Alright enough fun.
jake: How is this fun? What are you even doing here?
rick: Well, you know I'm Amir's broker?
jake: I didn't know that; I thought you were his bookie.
rick: Well, bookies are for thugs. Brokers are for mugs! 
jake: You gotta stop it with the puns, I don't know who told you you were good--
amir: Basically I give Rick money, you know, MY money, and he invests it in basketball games, baseball games,--
rick: Sports of that nature.
jake: So it sounds like you're still a bookie.
rick: I also bought him a share of Dell.
amir: Dude. I'm getting a share of Dell.
jake: Just one share?
rick: Yeah, I woulda bought him more, but he just lost forty Gs on the 1982 Miss Universe Pageant.
amir: Yeeah, Rick said that Miss East Germany was due, but uh, guess not. That was a big vig for the fantastic Mr. Fox--
amir and rick: eeheheh HENRY! HENRY! HENRY!--
jake: Stop! Stop.
jake: I saw that.
rick: No you didn't.

jake: Then why are you being so defensive about it?
rick: Ok, look man.  I need you guys to do me an omelette-sized favor.
amir: Anything!
jake: ..No!..
rick: Look, in about thirty minutes, a slew of farmers and cops are gonna come in here, looking for me.
jake: We said no.
rick: Well, they're gonna be talking all sorts of insane BS, about how I've stolen thousands of--
jake: --Eggs?
rick: No. What?
amir:  What? I'm like..
rick: Tractors!
amir:  I dunno..
rick: You seriously have a sick obsession.
amir:  You're like- What is wrong with you, man?
rick: Was your mom a.. a chicken or something?
amir: Were you frickin' laid, man? Were you frickin like hatched, bro?
jake: HE'S the one that comes in here cracking eggs-- you know what, never mind.
rick: Anyway, look. I need you guys.. to say that I was never here.
jake: Absolutely not.
amir:  He's gone!
jake: He's not gone. He walked like two feet; he's behind that plant.
jake:  You know you're not doing that good a job of hiding.
jake: At least move behind the main branch!
jake:  Okay.
amir: He's fine!
jake: He's not fine!
rick:  I'm fine! Be quiet!

intro:
jake: Hey you're watching Jake and Amir
amir: And you're botching Jake and Amir
jake: What?
amir: I don't know...
amir: As you probably already know, my great-uncle Gryan donated $100,000 dollars to me to start a business.
jake: I actually didn't know that, ok DON'T start a business; let's talk, we can invest the money.
amir: I already invested the money, ok? I bought 10,000 stars and named them after you, so first of all, you're welcome, second of all, let's think of business ideas so that I can get my money back.
jake: Alright I'm actually no longer interested, thank you--
amir: Ok, well scht- let me rattle off some of these ideas, and then you can tell me if they have legit potential or not. Number 1:--
jake: Before you get started, no ideas that have anything to do with stars.
amir: Okay, number 4. Oh actually, number 10 then.
amir: So you know to pop a zit on your back you need like a really long staw , and some elbow grease.
jake: No..
amir: You know how everybody and their widow is just aching to have a song written about them?
jake: You mean dead people?
amir: Yeah, well dead people have money, too.
jake: They actually don't.
amir: Do th- Oh my God, ok, so all these ideas are then a no-go..
jake: Yeah, look at that, you just drew a picture of a cemetery with dollar signs all over it.
amir: Yeah I thought it was a graveyard of money.
amir: So you know about Caps Lock, right?
jake: Yes.
amir: Ok, well this is Caps UNlock; yeah I'll give you all your lowercase letters, for a fee! Hehehe it's brilliant, are you kidding me it's genius!--
jake: Ok you just hit Caps Lock again and it all goes back to lowercase.
amir: You gotta be shitting me with that!
jake: You know you don't have to make that face when you listen to people.
amir: Well it just helps!
amir: Alright what's the worst part about aprons, on three, ready? One, two, three, they're too grey--
jake: Nothing.
amir: --Right, ok, nevermind.
amir: Alright let's say I know how to knit a sweater and you know how to speak German, so let's teach each other, let's trade our skill-sets and become more talented people.
jake: That's not a bad business idea.
amir: Well, wait 'til you hear the name of the business - Tick Dicklers
jake: Alright, I'm gonna pass because I assume the name is--
amir: Non-negotiable, that's correct.
amir: You know the hardest part about making toast is beating up and stealing bread from a baker.
jake: What?..
amir: WELL, ok let me finish, my business will loot that bakery and steal the bread for you.
jake: Ok it sounds illegal.
amir: Well I looked into it, ok? And it is, you're right, it is; how did you know that?
amir:  AAGH I can't stand it anymore, you're so negative all the time! Stop saying no no no no no no no, think!
amir:  It's nineteen dollars for a single one, so eat it bitches, cuz boy that's fun, I ca--
jake: Alright, you can't cuss in jingles.--
amir: Bitches is not a cuss, alright, but noted, cuz this thing does get very racy very soon--
jake:  Whoa, yeah!
jake:  Oh wow, more tombstones with dollar signs on 'em.
amir: Yea.
amir:  Oh sheesh y'all, it's a cream! It's a motherfuckin' icy dream, w-
jake: Alright what did I just say about cussing?
amir: Right, right, sorry.
amir: AAGH! That's it. One last.. little one.. gimme one more... IHATEYOU!
amir:  It's a frigid sting that you can't stand, it's a frozen treat inside your hands--
jake: So it sounds like you know this is a bad idea.
amir:  Yes, I do!
amir:  It's a Popsicle, without the stick, it's melting MELTING, eat it quick, it's a frozen treat that you must hold, you--
jake: Right, I just think this--
amir: Are you interrupting because you think I'm close to done? Cuz I'm not even at the frickin' VERSE yet, man.
jake: Then what are you singing right now--
amir: Pre-chorus!
END.
amir: Hey y'all you're watching Texas-sized edition of Jake and...
jake: Outta time
amir: Alrighty-hoo.
Amir 
amir: Nooo!
jake: Yeah, ok? And just so you know, this is what it looks like when you fall asleep at work. And sorry in advance, but I'm tweeting it.
jake: Hey, c'mon, don't look through my phone, man!
amir: Oh, wow.
jake: Oh wow, what!? How are you surprised at something you're not supposed to be seeing?
amir: How many fedoras did you try on!?
jake: It's called I tried on one fedora at one store as a joke and my dumb godson saved it to my phone like 90 times.
amir: No no, these are different fedoras, it's you at different stores.
jake: Details Magazine says there's no cooler look than an opened up button-down, Hemp Sandals and a fedodo. Or was Jason Mraz in O2 not styling?
amir: You look so sad in some of these pictures, man.
jake: GQ says to get ready for the summer starting in February, that way I'm beach-ready and rock-steady and Dora like an Explora I'm rocking that fedora.
amir: Stop, what are you doing? What do you mean?
jake: I'm saying: if this were a sit-up competition, you'd be the one that was embarrased right now, not the other way around.
amir: If you're embarassed by these pictures, how are you ever gonna actually wear the fedora?
jake: I'm not gonna wear it to work, Yosemite Sam, abba-dee, abba-dee, abba-dee, I'll wear it to a club folks!
amir: What is wrong with you?
jake: Oh my god, you don't get sarcasm. These pictures are a goof!
amir: No.
jake: These pictures are of you!
amir: No!?
jake: Gimme my phone. That's right. Hey everybody, Amir spent every weekend for the last two months shopping for fedoras at every store he could find. J Crew, Hollister, HM, Abercrombie, Forever 21. Where else did I go? Did he go! Pacsun. C'mon, c'mon! See these embarassing pics before I tag them on Facebook.
amir: Please do not tag them on Facebook.
jake: Hashtag: douchebag! By the Seashore.
murph: Haha, nice!
jake: Here we go.
murph: Uhm, Jake these pictures are all of you.
jake: I was re-enacting it, dude. You gotta learn how to be funny. These pictures are of you!
INTRO Jake - Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir.
Amir - And I just sat in cheese! Thank you!
Jake- How?
jake: Hey, who's chicaqueenvixenstyle.tumblr.com?
amir: Promise not to tell?
jake: I already know it's you.
amir: It's me.
jake: I know.
amir: I blog under a pseudonym so that people can't really tell--
jake: You don't. You sign every single post Amir Valerie Blumenfeld.
amir: My blog is a one stop shop for mom and pop, but don't bring dad around here. This ain't no place for dads.
jake: Really bad slogan, dude.
amir: That's why I barely even used it, dude.
jake: It's everywhere on the front page. Like a lot.
amir: Barely on there.
jake: Don't say barely, you're scrolling right now.  Look, I can see you counting, if you're counting then it's too many.
amir: It's too many.
jake: These sex tips are like, really out there.
amir: Yeah, it's about being confident, sexy and fabulous. OK? Guys can tell, trust me.
jake: This one says put a  on it  until he bleeds.
amir: Did you know that a praying mantis have one spouse, one spouse for their entire life. OK, we can learn a lot from that.
jake: That's not true.
amir: It's on the blog.
jake: That doesn't make it a fact, man. I think you confuse them with penguins because right here you wrote, in all caps, penguins eat their husbands.
amir: OK, how about this for a true fact--
jake: If it's about praying mantises, I don't want to know.  So it was.
amir:  So you were.
jake: That's not what I said. If you're going to mock me, at least listen to what--
amir: Praying mantises can screw for 9 hours straight, OK? It's the most tantric sex you could ever imagine and I'm just supposed to sit on my fat butt and not blog about that? Like, no, I can't, what are you tal--
jake: You know, I'm also realizing that a lot of your tips of the day are really mean, the same thing, and not tips. Like this one says 'my blog is the one stop shop for mom and pop, but don't bring your dad around here. This ain't no place for dads.'
amir: Yeah, it's called reverse psychology, OK? I say it ain't no place for dads--
jake: All your other tips say 'long hair makes you look like a horse'!
amir: Pony tails...are for ponies.
jake: Delete your blog.
amir: OK, if you could just give me one bit of advice. Just one suggestion, because right now I feel like it's coming--
jake: It's delete the whole thing.
amir: After that, all right? Next tip, OK, let's say--
jake: I guess the slogan. OK? It's kind of redundant to say 'dont' bring your dad around here' and then also say 'this ain't no place for dads'.
amir: You just lost all your credibility like that. 
jake: Ooo, you can't snap.
amir: No, but Widely agreed that that slogan was the smartest thing I ever came up with.
jake: Who agreed with that?
amir: My friend Widely.
jake: Your friends have the stupidest names I've ever heard--
amir: YEAH, well you look like a short-haired horse!
jake: You know, I was thinking more about your fashion blog, and maybe I could help you out by writing a column.  Maybe then people will go to it. It'll be like J-Witz talking about fedo-do's, leather bands, vests . . .
amir: Nah, I'm OK. Tha--

amir: It will just slice through this fig. It will cut through this carob. And if you don't believe me, let's do 'em both, at the same  ti-ahh
jake: Sorry, man, I wan't listening.
amir: That's OK.  Did you see it cut the fig? And just slice through that carob?
jake: I did hear you cut your finger. I told you to be careful.
amir: You didn't? 
jake: I did, yes I did, I actually did.
amir:  You didn't?  You didn't? But that's OK, because you know what, a good salesman powers through. How often do you cut a steak?
jake: I just caught a glimpse of that cut, man, and that's really bad.
amir: Yeah.
jake: The tip of your thumb is just dangling.
amir: Yeah, now you know how sharp the paring knife is, right?  Hm, hmmm.
jake: Wow, that's not good enough, O.K., you can't just lick it like you're eating barbecue ribs, you have to go to the E.R.
amir: And you have to go to jail. O.K? Because these, these knives are a steal at any price.
jake: Alright, number one, why are you selling knives? O.K., you have a job, and number two, where did you get carobs and figs? And number three, you don't have a thumb. Go to the hospital.
amir: I don't need a thumb, O.K., 'cause I got nine fingers left, nine reasons why these will be the last knives you ever have to buy.
jake: Put pressure on the wound!
amir: Mhmm, I am, I'm gonna put pressure on the yound to snatch these up A.S.A.P. because supplies are limited.
jake: Stop flipping this around, O.K., you're losing a lot of blood.
amir: Yeah? Well you're losing the deal of a lifetime. How's that for deadly?
jake: O.K., how much- how much are the knives?
amir: Oh these knives? Sorry, these are not for sale. I'd be crazy to sell these to you.
jake: Don't try the stupid sales trick on me, O.K., I'll give you a hundred dollars if you'll just go take care of yourself.
amir: I'll take the money but you cannot get these knives. I'm sorry.
jake: What is going on?
amir: I spent a fricken g on these knives, like, an hour ago, I can't just give them to you.
jake: You were just trying to sell them to me!
amir: No, I'm trying to sell you these carobs and figs, the softest fruit you'll ever see, but you were just obsessed with the knives so I thought I'd do that for a bit before veering the argument back to carobville. Unfortunately, I got a little sliced en route, so-
jake:  Hi, 9-1-1? Yes, I need an ambulance.
amir:  You need a fig.
jake: Right, my coworker-
amir: Best friend.
jake: cut off his thumb. Amir, what blood type are you?
amir: O-positive. As in oh, I'm positive you'll need a fig and a carob when I'm done with you-
jake: She hung up.
amir: O.k., let me call her back. 
jake: Hey, ahh!

amir:  Americans are paying at the pump -
jake: That's a newspaper not a script.
amir:  Whasevah.
amir:  Yek.  Let me ask you a question.  You on the good book?  The facebook?
jake:  Yeah
amir:  Yeah?  It's kinda like MySpace but for college kids, it's all interactive.
jake:  Right, that's not true, I said I was on it.
amir:  You don't think it's interactive?
jake:  Just, what's your point?
amir:  I'm saying these privacy settings they're completely wack.
jake:  Meaning?
amir:  Oh, come on, you gotta be pretty nave to think Zark Fuckerberg isn't selling our shit to Skymall for kickbacks at this point.
jake:  Just type it all up in an email and send it to me.
amir:  Ok, no no.  Explain to me how my account gets hacked every day.
jake:  Sometimes I see your facebook password as you status message.
amir:    Yeah, because I think I'm logged out but I'm not, ok!?  So I'm typing it in but it's my status!
jake:  Don't yell at me like that's not an answer to your question.
amir:  I'm just saying that some of these privacy settings are legit anus-infested, ok?  Everybody-Like every rando with a smartphone and an AOL account could just access my pics.
jake:  Your pics?  You have one facebook album titled 'Another Day at the Races' and there's only one photo in here and it appears to be you at a dog pound bottomless with peanut butter all over your flaccid penis, you're surrounded by ten puppies and each one of them is ignoring you.
amir:  I need to untag it.
jake:  You need to delete it from the internet entirely.  Ok, you're wearing a shirt that's like eight sizes too big and it reads 'don't be offended if you're a dog lover - so am I' and the caption of the photo is 'who wants to see me get my D wet' subcaption 'you're gay if you click this' subcaption 'delete' subcaption -
amir:   Subcaption!  Subcaption caption!
jake:   Don't make fun of me here, ok?!  You're the idiot.  Subcaption: your facebook password.
amir:  I thought I was logged the fuck out!
jake:  How about this?  Just calm down, let's calm down.  Look at the groups you're a member of.
amir:  I am calm.
jake:  'One million strong against the new facebook,'  '10 million strong against the facebook redesign,' '100 million to say that Facebook is spying on us,' 'Amir Blumenfelds of the world unite.'  This last one, 'If one billion people join this group I'll slam my nuts in the door.'  All of them you're the only member, and this last one you uploaded the video...  It's you slamming your nuts in the door!  Why would you do that before anybody joined?
amir:  Because I wanted to sweeten the deal!  Alright, I wanted to let people know what was in store for them if they signed up for the frickin' group!
jake:  So you actually just went and slammed your nuts in the door?!
amir:  Well, ah, ok, here's the thing.  I got amped up, right, I was trying to pump myself up to actually do the video one day and I said you know what, I'm ready, so I end up slamming my nuts in the door, and what am I gonna do?  Just sit on the video? No, I decided to upload it, and you know what?-
jake:  It has three views!
amir:  Exactly!  And you know what?  Those three views they're probably all from a frickin' Skymall and Zark Fuckerberg he's walking around right now with massage boots over his head because it's a kickback from the frickin' mall!

jake: It's 28 degrees outside.
amir: Yeah, it was a little cold, but -uh- it's worth it.
jake: Your legs turned purple.
amir : It doesn't matter. 'Cause I can't feel them. Are you ready?
jake: To take you to a hospital?-
amir: -To participate in my office obstacle course?
jake: Yeah, I don't want to do that man.
amir: Why, you're afraid you can't beat my time?
jake: No, I'm afraid I'm not gonna get any work done to-
What time? Time for what?
amir: My lap time. One lap around the office hurtling over chairs to the
bathroom and back.
jake: Yeah, I'm not worried about that. What was the time, by the way?
amir: One minute and eight seconds
jake: That's a pretty bad idea and it's a bad time.
amir: Yeah, well forget it.
jake: I could beat that time.
amir: I mean if you want I could set it up
amir: -up and start... Okay
jake: Oww. Time out.
amir: You didn't let me start my watch.
jake : Yeah it's called getting a head start.
amir: That's against the rules.
jake: It's against the rules to not tell me the rules before I start running. That's probably why I busted my shin dude.
amir: How does that have anything to do with your shin?
jake: I'm taking a minute off the final time I'm sorry. Alright you ready?
amir: No. You can't dock-
jake: Go!
jake: Whew. Time?
amir: That was - you didn't do any of it. You didn't hurdle over the chairs.
You didn't run to the bathroom and back.
jake: Yeah, that would've taken forever. What was my time?
amir: I guess like three seconds- four seconds
jake : Alright, three seconds minus the minute that I'm docking...that's like negative fifty-two seconds... a new record.
amir : What a weird math.. No that's not right.
jake: I don't need math, dude. Not when I'm this athletic. Give me some ice though, my shin is starting to swell right the heck up.
amir : See the workplace doesn't have to be boring. Get together, make the day fun. What are some ways you spice up the work environment? Let us know by-
jake: Look man, give me the ice. My shin is starting to turn not-a-good color.
amir: Red?
jake: Worse, green.

jake: That's not brownies.
amir: It's batter.
jake: Exactly.
amir: Here'a hint, bake something and leave it on your desk. It's a great way to meet coworkers, okay, people will be dying to taste your tasty treats.
jake: Number one, you didn't bake anything, you made batter. And you didn't  do that good of a job.
amir : Yeah, there are egshells in this for sure.
jake: Number two, it's not a good way to meet co-workers. Alright, you look  desperate. You look needy.
amir: How's this for desperate and needy? I'm lonely and I wanna make friends.
jake: For desperate that's pretty good.
amir: Okay. So what do you suggest?
jake: I don't know. Why don't you just try talking to people?
amir: Uhh- no thank you.
jake: If you don't want to talk to people, then why make the treats to begin with?
amir: It's called eating healthy.
jake: I's not. Look if wanna make friends at work don't just sit at your desk trying to buy their affection. Get up, have conversations, and be friendly.
amir: Done.
jake: So you're not gonna do it?
amir: Well, I wanna see how this brownie thing plays out first.
pat: Hi Amir-
amir : What's up Pat, old friend?
pat: Can you throw out this batter? It's- it's really starting to smell.

amir: You'll never guess who I ran into in the elevator.
jake: Who?
amir: Guess!
jake: You just told me not to guess.
amir: No, I said you'll never guess.
jake: it's the same thing.
amir: It's not. It's not even close.
jake: It's at least close... Steve.
amir: I don't know... what? Who's that? What's he saying?
jake: I don't know, a guy who works here, maybe?
amir: No, I shouldn't have even had you guess. I don't even know anyone's name anyway.
jake: Honestly, man? I was bluffing. I don't know anyone's name either.
amir: Yeah, which makes it all the worse that I barrelled into this dude in the elevator.
jake: Oh, you like literally ran into him.
amir: Yeah. I mean, accidentally but like at full speed, yeah.
jake: Why?
amir: I didn't know his name.
jake: That's not what I asked.
amir: Heh. I don't even know your name.
jake: Wow.
amir: No. That's not it. It starts with a D, right?
jake: It's Jake, you say it all the time.
amir: Dude we should have a party. A get together.
jake: I know what a party is. You should leave work before you ge -
amir: No no no we should just introduce each other to everybody, you know, at the party? That way, we can learn everybody's names.
jake: We're supposed to already know everybody's names.
amir: I have an idea.
Screen goes black. The caption "...5 minutes later" appears. After, Amir is eating a roll.
jake: You really might be in trouble. What was your idea by the way, you haven't said anything.
amir: Oh it's just to get this sandwich, I was hungry.
jake: Gotcha.
amir: Ok, NOW I have an idea.
Another "...5 minutes later" caption appears.
amir: Mm! Yeah! It's way better with ketchup!
jake: Good for you. Alright, now I have an idea.
Another caption "...5 minutes later" appears. Afterwards, there are people standing around with "Hello my name is" nametags on.
jake: Welcome to our nametag get together... Martin!
martin: What's with the nametags?
amir: Oh, it's obviously a joke. We already know each other's names.
joel: I don't know your name.

Jake - Ok.
Amir - Six weeks in, and I haven't showed up yet.
Jake - Heheh nice, alright, I actually have to write this e-mail so...
Amir - Day one and I show up ready as a raw rack of ribs.
Jake - You just said you never showed up.
Amir - First up is a 2 mile power jog on this death machine they call a trackmill.
Jake - Treadmill.
Amir - So I use the opportunity to go for a run myself, out of the friggin gymnastium. But not before proving my worth to the instructor by picking up the biggest weight I could find... The weight to the women's locker room. Hahah.
Jake - 
Amir - Didn't think you'd get that. Now I actually bend down to pick up a barbell that probably grossed about 80 kilos and pop goes my weasel. My back is pulled like a pork sandwich in pot-tuckey.
Jake - I don't wanna hear the whole story man, ok. You're only on day one.
Amir - I practiced like... ok.
Jake - Ok.
Amir - It's just that I practiced a lot you know, that story was very very memorized, and the metaphors were very tight, ok. I figured you'd appreciate it.
Jake - Well you figured so completely wrong.
Amir - Sure...so.... What now?
Jake - We work, ok. You don't have to talk to me.
Amir - It's fine.
Jake - It's fine.
Amir - ...Then I won't.... Second day's the first loser so I walk back into that nastium with my head held higher than a helium kite on the fourth planet... Martians.
Jake - You said the metaphors were tight man, that was such a stretch.
Amir - Yeah, well you said you didn't even want to hear 'em.
Jake - Exactly.
Amir - So I stopped.
Jake - And then you started again.
Amir - Let me at least rattle off the metaphors ok, not the whole story, just, you know... otherwise they weren't even worth me thinking of.
Jake - They weren't.
Amir - Flaccid as an octopus in a cowboy costume.
Jake - Bad.
Amir - Hell time at high noon day.
Jake - Not a metaphor.
Amir - Let me finish, sorry but... Hell time at high noon day. Uh, chicken-eyed like a cock nosed rooster.
Jake - So you were finished with the hell time one.
Amir - With the hell time one yeah, yeah I was.
Jake - I don't even know how chicken-eyed would even fit into the story.
Amir - And now you'll never know.
Jake - I have a feeling you're gonna tell me...
Amir - Day 12 is breathing exercises and pelvic stretching, so I'm like fff-no. Heh. Ef-no.
Jake - Pelvic Stretches? What kind of boot camp was this?
Amir - It's a post natal baby boot camp, ok. Imagine my surprise when I find out.

Jake - Jake and Amir.
Amir - Same difference!
jake: Hey, can I ask you a question? Why are you always writing in your notebook and never on your computer?
amir: Can I ask you question? Stand up so I can see your jeans.
jake: That's not a question. Let me see your notebook.
jake: What are you doing?  I ask and you throw over, you're an asshole.  OK, 'Dear Diary--
amir: It's a journal.
jake: You write diary! You start every entry with 'dear diary'.
amir: As a goof.
jake: On who?? You wrote, 'dear diary, Jake hasn't complimented me in a million days' which sounds like an exaggeration because two days ago in a date marked October and 40th--
amir: All Hallow's Eve.
jake: Nope. You wrote, 'Jake complimented me today.' Which I actually don't remember.
amir: Yeah! You were texting, OK? And someone said something that made you laugh, and you were smiling, and then you looked up at me and like, you know, once--
jake:  'once our eyes met, his smiled turned instantly into a scowl, but for that moment, he was all smiles and it was like a--
amir and jake: Dream'.
amir: Yeah, exactly.
jake: You count that as a compliment?
amir: Yeah! That's a win! OK, I count that as a 'W' in the old diary.
jake: I thought it was a journal.
amir: That's a journal.  This is a diary.
jake: That's a scroll. Let me see your backpack.
jake: Yeah. This is just filled with notebooks and scrolls.
amir: Dinner tonight?
jake: Wow, please don't start saying that again.
amir: I barely say it anymore!
jake: You used to say it all the time.
amir: Exactly, and that's why it's funny to do that.
jake: What?
amir: You say stuff over and over, OK? That's what makes it funny.
jake: Yeah but it gets old and repetitive.
amir: No, no-
jake: You have to change it up a little.
amir: No, no! In a perfect world, everything would always stay the same. OK, nothing would ever change, you know that.
jake: Wow, yeah, you wrote that in your diary.
amir: Journal.

jake: Gotta stop saying that man, what happened to you?
amir: My snake frickin', clipped me or something.
jake: Yeah, it looks like it did clip you.
amir: Yeah went right for the jugular too, smug prick. Got me once in the neck, twice in the forearm, and then like two more times in the abdomen.
jake: So not right in the jugular, right? Why were you fighting a snake?
amir: I didn't feed the prick for like, two weeks 'cause she was being a bitch. Then I decided to start taunting her, you know, dancing around with dead mice all over my body. Dumb ass went for it! And got it!
jake: Sounds like you're the prick and the bitch because you're starving a snake. You're also the dumbass because you're dancing around a hungry snake with mice all over your body.
amir: So you're saying I'm dumber than a snake?
jake: I wasn't saying that, but yeah, for the record I do think you're dumber than a snake.
amir: OK you should have been there man, Leron was dying!
jake: He was laughing at you?
amir: No he was legit dying, like he got bit by a snake last week but he was like too cool to go to the hospital....
jake: Was it a snake or your snake?
amir: It's my snake now because I liked her feistiness, OK? But it was a snake at the time. I thought I could tame the wild beast. Turns out.... I could!
jake: No it turns out you couldn't, cause remember it clipped you? This morning? Like six times?
amir: Mmhmm....
jake: OK you shouldn't own pets man, you can barely keep yourself alive.
amir: OK don't tell me I shouldn't own pets, I've had like, ten owls in the past year.
jake: What happened to them?
amir: They're frickin' dead!  gives a shit?

amir:  Great! So, we'll see you in a month, like... what?
karen: Well... uh, we still haven't firmed up any locations.
amir: I told you three months ago I was on it.
karen: I know, but the last time I emailed you for a status update, you sent me a video of a monkey who smells his hand and faints.
amir: Yeah. That's because he farted in it.
mark: 
amir: That's funny to you?!
mark: Isn't it supposed to be?
amir: Am I excused, like...?
jake: We haven't gotten anywhere yet.
karen: Last time we spoke, you said an elephant ride was doable, as a carnival for young kids.
amir: Right. And I stand by that.
mark: My brother-in-law and I have devised a way to steal large animals from circuses and zoos. If you're really certain about this, I can get you an elephant.
amir: Dead or alive?
jake: Alive! Alive, right? Don't do it. But if you do: Alive.
mark: I-I-I-I have to make a call. I'm not sure if I can make this alive thing happen.
karen: What about the mural?
amir: What ABOUT the mural, Kare?
jake: Will you please not snap at Karen?
karen: You said you had been able to procure--
amir:  Yeah, a 200 foot by 10 foot concrete wall -- blank as the night -- ready to be painted by the imaginative fingers of today's youth.
karen: And?
amir: And... I was able to... get one twice as big.
karen: 
amir: So... double the kids... on that... Karen.
karen: They are going to be so happy!
jake: He just winked at me, but even if he didn't, I doubt he could have gotten a wall like that.
amir: NARC!
karen: Well, uh... what about snacks? People are going to be hungry.
mark: How does two tons of wet elephant meat sound?
jake: It doesn't sound good, Mark.
mark: I don't want to say how or why, but I have recently come into a surplus of elephant meat.
jake: We know how.
mark: I certainly can't eat all of it -- trust me on that!
amir: What about music, okay? Some phat beats, dope rhymes, things like--
jake:  I'll take care of the music.
amir: I can freestyle for about two and half hours straight. Make your face leak underneath... all that stuff--
jake:  You couldn't freestyle for like ten seconds just now--
amir:  I'm going to get a CD! A frickin' mix cassette tape -- how does that sound for a freestyle?
jake: Those sound like two different things! I'll get a DJ, okay?
mark: Alright. Can we go?
amir: You can go... to jail! For killing and de-tusking an elephant. I mean, how long are we going to stand idly by--
mark:  I didn't touch a single tusk!  Not one tusk!
jake: Hey!
amir: Okay, Karen...?
jake: Come on, Mark!
amir: Karen! I have your wall! I have your wall, Karen!
jake: Karen! Karen! Karen!
karen: No! No!
jake: Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir.
amir: With no hands, bitches!
jake: What?
amir: I don't know...
amir: I gotta cut out early today...
jake: It's 4:50, and you just showed up for the first time.
amir: Yeah, well, I gotta go to prom.
jake: No, you don't.
amir: Oh my god. You sound just like her dad.
jake: Whose dad?
amir: The girl that refused to go with me.
jake: You're a bad person.
amir: Yeah, so me and my boys  rented a limo . We're gonna go... stag. 
jake: Why the air quotes?
amir: That's when you go alone, without a date, but
jake: I know what stag is; you did air quotes over my boys.
amir: 'Cause none of those douches ponied up the dough yet, all right? And they all said no to me. It's like, I'm doing all the leg work; the least they could do is not yell at me.
jake: Gotcha, so it sounds like you're going to prom completely alone.
amir: Nah, I'm gonna go with Mickey, my friend.  Goal of the prom is to pour a gallon of milk on the bitch that refused this hand.
jake: Why milk?
amir:  Okay, get this, poetic justice...
jake: Don't whisper to me, okay? I don't wanna know your secrets.
amir: Couple of weeks ago, a few of her friends beat the shit out of me.
jake: So you got your ass kicked by a bunch of highschoolers.
amir: Not a bunch! Okay, just two sluts that wouldn't take Please, I'm sorry! for an answer.  They pushed me into a cow. Dodged a bullet there...
jake: Okay, why the corsage?
amir: What?
jake: The corsage?
amir:  Okay, is there an answer I could give that wouldn't result in you hating me more?
jake: I guess you could say this corsage is for an unfortunate kid who couldn't afford a gift for his date, and the only reason I'm in a tuxedo is because I rented a limo and I'm gonna take them to prom myself.
amir:  ...No.
jake: I didn't think so.
amir: Yeah, it's, like, not even close to that...
jake: I know.
amir: I was gonna put this corsage on her milk-soaked wrist and plug away at her fingers like they're little udders, while the whole school hopefully chants, Moo, cow, moo! Moo, cow, moo! Moo, cow, moo!
jake: All right, dinner tonight?
amir: What?
jake: Just you and me, dinner... skip the prom.
amir:  Okay.
jake: All right, great!
amir: ...I just have to, like, swing by for, like,  twenty seconds,  to go into the prom for, like, a little bit!  We're gonna go  for half a second!  To pour a gallon of milk on the bitch; I still wanna do that!
jake: That's exactly what I'm trying to avoid.
amir: It's too late, okay; I already have the whole thing pretty much planned out.
jake: Okay, well, if it's only planned out pretty much, then it's not too late.
amir:  Oh! Speak of the devil!  Hey bitch!  Hey, I hope you're not lactose intolerant'cause you're getting milked tonight!  Good! No, good, put him on.  Hey sir. Hi, yes, uh, your daughter is a nobody at high school. I'm friends with Dylan, okay? I know what's cool. He wears frickin' sunglasses to class. Yeah! No, I'm in the cool group, and we all agree that your daughter is a zero. She's less than a zero, and guess what? She's gonna wake up with cheese in her ears tomorrow morning, which ain't gonna help the situation.  Y'know what, good, call the cops. I just won't show up then.  Actually... can you not, because I wanted to show up and do the milkwell, I don't wanna get arrested! So now I can't goI dropped a G on this frickin' tux, sir! This was supposed to be the most magical night of my life, and you're basically telling me notthat I can't go, because I'mokay. Great. Bye.  Yeah, my night just opened up hard, so we can hang out. I might wanna call in a bomb threat though, y'know; if the fuzz are gonna be there, we might as well frickin' make them earn their keep.
amir:  Ah, Mickey, my friend!  Good news, sir! There was no traffic, and I am there early! Come outside. That body you're about to see hanging out of a stretch Hummerzine? That is me, my friend! That is all me.  Can you see me? I'm waving my hands, Mickey! Nah, you can't see me, because I'm not there, Mickey. I got stood up to prom, Mickey, and now you are too! Yeah, Operash Milk? That's a no-go. I don't cI don't know, man; you spent two weeks on a dairy farm.  That's not my problem anymore! That's your milk, your problem, Mickey! The operash is a no-go like I said, Mickey. All right, I'm just kidding; come outside'CAUSE I'M NOT THERE.

jake: Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir.
amir: No big deal.
jake: It's not.
amir: Then I was right.
amir: Can't photograph this moment. This is the kind of moment you just have to be in.
jake: You know what? You're right. 
amir: We get so concerned about finding the right picture, the right frame that  we don't get the right memory.
jake: Okay.
amir: 'Cause a moment is just that. It's a moment and then it's a second and as soon as you identify it it's over. So... 'Cause you can look at the sun  and you can say-
jake:  This is really nice.
amir: What?
jake: I'm saying it's really nice.
amir: I know and I'm just saying not to take today for granted.
jake: I won't.
amir: 'Cause if you do  then it's just gonna slip awa- okay.
jake:  Well I said I wan't going to. I'm not going to so don't tell me what the repercussions are 'cause they don't matter.
amir: I'm just saying that if you do-
jake: I don't need to know the repercussions.
amir: Okay, but if you do, if you take today for granted, then you shouldn't, because it's just gonna slip away.
jake: Fine. Fine. Alright, why did you insist on telling me? You know, you ever think about this? Maybe you're ruining the moment by talking through it.
amir: I don't care.
jake: Alright. 
amir:  Another thing about the sun is that you can't stare at it 'cause it's too beautiful to take in.
jake: It's too bright.
amir: Nah, it's too much beauty for your eyes all at once.
jake: It's too bright. Okay, let's just enjoy this moment in silence.
amir: That's what I said.
jake: I know, I was agreeing with you.
amir: Okay. Just don't steal it from me.
jake: I'm not stealing it.  Agreed. I said that I agreed.
amir:  You're stealing it 'cause I said it and now you're saying- Just give me your phone.
jake: No. Alright?
amir: Give me your phone!
jake: Why do you want to see my phone?
amir: Because I wanna take a twit-pic of this.
jake: Okay, well you came over here and you told me that taking pictures was bad, to stay in the moment.
amir: That's 'cause I didn't see how cool it looked and now that I see how awesome it is I really want it on my Facebook wall. Okay, I really wanna take a picture  then post it online, otherwise it doesn't exist. No, gimme!  Gimme your phone!
jake:  Well use your own phone, okay, you followed me here, you followed-  I- I- Get off me! Ow, ow, ow, Amir, listen- Fine, take it! God, what are you- 
amir: Okay? Are you happy? Disconnect, bitch! Sign off. Get away from the grid. It's over. You are so mad because- Oh my- I'm taking a picture of that. I am  taking a picture, me and the grump.  Tweeting it, hashtag douche doesn't know how to disconnect.  Whatsoeva. Where are you?  Another thing about the sun...

amir: Two-door or four-door?
david : You're missing the point.
jake: You guys gotta learn how to be funny. You gotta learn how to be  funny.
amir: Oh no!
jake: Oh yeah!
david: Jake, Pat was in a serious car accident, so...
jake: Did the other driver need to learn how to be funny? 
murph: What?
jake: I asked if he was okay. I said, "is Pat okay?" and then you guys stared at me like I was Great Caesar's ghost.
david: His brothers are at the hospital right now but uhm...
jake: But uhm Busted Tees.
david: What?
jake: I said it's great that his family is there. That's really important you know to be there for him but you can buy the funny shirt at Busted Tees and that's, we're done talking about it.  His life is hanging by a thread. Speaking of threads 
amir: I will buy one.
jake: That's one! Can I get another? Can I get another? To the highest bidder.
amir: Me.
jake: Not the time
amir: Okay.
jake: Not the time. Not right now. Email me later about the shirts.
amir: I'll buy the shirt right now.

jake: I am calm, all right. I'm pissed! Some drunk driving f-wad killed our friend.  Is he gonna be fine or what?
david: He's not gonna be fine, but he's not dead.
jake: If he's not dead then why are we stressed out, okay?
amir: Thank you.
david: He may not walk again.
jake: Oh my God then I have the perfect thing for him.  It's called a t-shirt and you don't need legs to wear one.  All you need to do is...
amir: You gotta learn how to be funny
jake: HAHA don't. All right? You're not exactly great at bringing street cred to things.
david: Okay, I think you should go home. Both of you should go home.
amir: Jake, let's go, he's right
jake: No trust me man, I'd love to go home. I would love to. But then you guys would guaranteed stop talking about the shirts.
amir: That's true
jake: Don't pick that up man, we're in the middle of talking.
murph: It's Pat's brother.
jake: Oh my god you can call him back.  Does your phone have caller ID?

INTRO
jake: Hey, you're watching Jake and Ami- Ow! You stabbed me!
amir: In the hand...
jake: Yeah!
amir: So?
jake: So I read it.
amir: Took you long enough.
jake: It's over 400 pages.
amir: Yeah, most of that is scene direction, though-
jake: -Which makes it longer.
amir: Enough talk. What'd you think?
jake: Sounds like you still want to be talking then.
amir: What did you think?
jake: That you shouldn't write screenplays anymore.
amir: Give me one thing, okay? Give me one thing to hone in on. It's so broad.
jake: I'm not going to give you one thing. You always want one thing.There are thousands of screenplay rules, right? And I can't imagine one of them that you didn't break.
amir: Just try to focus all your energy, like a laser, on one thing, yeah.
jake: Stop saying like you want one thing, like you only could've made one mistake. You made a lot of mistakes.
amir: Focus it. Focus in on one.
jake: Okay, the first mistake you could've made: your title is F*ck It: I'm Going Fishing Instead.
amir: Wow! Congrats, grad! You can read.
jake: Don't get defensive so early, okay? I mean, I read the whole thing, didn't I? And page 96 to 311 is one long, unbroken run-on sentence about how your main character, Brake Obama - a name I assume you spelled incorrectly-
amir: -Probably autocorrected...
jake: I doubt it. About how Brake Obama either needs to show his birth certificate or resign as mayor.
amir: That impostor is from Hawaii, I guarantee it.
jake: Okay, that's true.
amir: Maybe you'll be singing a different tune when you realize who we were thinking of for the male lead.
jake: Another thing: all of your scene headings say Interior: I don't give a flaming fuck.
amir: Edward frickin' Nort.
jake: Norton.
amir: No, my cousin's lawyer, Edward Nort.
jake: You know, I don't even think you need an actor because there's only one line of dialogue. It comes on page 299, and I think it's a typo because the main character says, Interior: I don't give a flaming fuck.
amir: You should've heard Mr. Nort deliver that line. He nailed it in callbacks.
jake: Okay, how about this: I'll shred the entire thing and as a favor to you, I will never bring it up again.
amir: So basically, you're jealous 'cause we didn't cast you as the main guy.
jake: Okay, I'm not jealous, alright? I don't give a shit.
amir: You're not annoyed we went with Nort over you?
jake: I would've loved at least an opportunity to make callbacks, to know I was seriously considered.
amir: You were seriously considered. You were!
jake: Oh, bullshit!
amir: Yes!
jake: You dragged my ass in there as a dog and pony show, alright? You had Nort and I from day one and you put in there to light a fire under Nort's agent's ass. Well guess what?  Interior: I don't give a flaming fuck-
amir: -Bad!
jake: That was not bad! That was good! Nort's bad. Here we go, southern twang!  Interior-
amir: -No.
jake: I don't give a- Don't say No while I'm talking, okay? Let me finish! It's gonna sound bad if you say No while I'm trying to do it. Listen!  Interior: I don't give a flaming fuck.
amir: No.

amir: Lock the door, please.
jake: Do you want half of my sandwich?
jake: Okay, well, don't ask me to eat lunch with you if you don't have any food, at all. I keep telling you--
amir: You keep on telling me to ? Heheh, what is that?
amir: Heheheh! Come on, laugh! That's funny. I laugh at all your jokes, and trust me: they are not all winners.
amir: Okay, what is this?  I never studied the universal symbols for stuff.
amir: How 'bout this: If you're really choking, spin around in your chair.
amir: Nahhh. Not buying that! Not buying that at all. That's a fake spin; you're just spinning to make it seem like you're choking because I told you to spin.
david: Jake's choking!
amir: No no, this is just a game we're playing, okay? And you're not invited. So leave.
amir: Sorry, it's just that if this isn't a goof, it should be me that saves you, not some... other loser, alright? Amir saves Jake. That's... that's the lead.
amir: I'm gonna eat your sandwich... so if you're alive... better stop me...
amir: Okay... great acting job. The best Actor... -Grammy... goes to... you!  You didn't laugh at any of my jokes... and now I'm not gonna save yours.  Um...  Ummm...  You're fired!  Hm. Wow... you know, I gotta hand it to you, man... didn't think you'd take it this far! Hm. Aah!
amir: You know what? Now I wish you are alive, because if you're dead, people are gonna blame me... and you're gonna feel... like a pony.  Okay! This has been a dope lunch, thank you, but I don't deserve this star-treatment. So.
jake: Come on, did that really not look real?

INTRO
amir:  Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir.
jake: A little more effort, right?
amir: Nah.
amir:  That was the best! Are you guys laughing 'cause you're about to get fired?
jake: Why would we be laughing if that were the case?
amir: I don't know, why'd you cut out at 3:30 to go get ice cream?
jake: There's an ice cream truck downstairs. We were gone for like, fifteen minutes.
amir: Uh, actually, my dear Watson, it was twelve.
jake: So it was less than I thought. It's the first nice day of the year and - No! No. I don't have to justify this to you.
amir: No, you don't have to justify it to me. You do have to justify it to your boss, though.  Don't you?
jake:  What are these?
amir: Thirty three emails sent from your account to Ricky, your boss. Shame you weren't here to stop me. Oh wait, I forgot. You're in a corn maze!
jake: You actually did forget; we were getting ice cream.  Dear Ricky, I don't value my job as much as I do that sweet, sweet cream.
amir: Yeah, and then he responds as the Donald, Ya fired.
jake: No, he didn't respond. You emailed him again, and you said, Do you want your letter of resignation in a waffle cone or a waffle bowl, sir? Or is it easier if I just blend it up in a soy vanilla frappuccino?
amir: Yeah, cream on the side.
jake: Didn't write that.
amir: And mixed in.
jake: Didn't write that.
amir: I just thought of it two seconds ago. Otherwise I would've written it. But now, Ricky gets the hit and he's livid.
jake: No, that's when you finally got his auto-response. He's on vacation for the week, and you responded to that, What a quinky-doink, I'm also on vacation as I've mentally checked the f*ck out twelve minutes ago and went deep in that cream, cream county, and you know what? It is sweet. It tastes like never working in this town again.
amir: For a thousand Gs, I will un-send that email.
jake: You can't do that. It looks like you started back-tracking anyways, 'cause this email reads: Sir, forgive me for getting ice cream, I value this job.
amir: Yeah, keep reading. It gets brat-worse.
jake: No, it doesn't, it looks like you come clean in the next email; you write, You've just been had, this was an Amir Blumenfeld prank-duction. You shoulda seen the look on your face.
amir: You looked like a friggin dildo baggins!
jake: You didn't write that.
amir: I just thought of it! Everything that I'm saying now, I just thought of so it's not in the emails.
jake: Okay, well I'm just saying you didn't add it. Okay, well you went on; you said, Please, please, please open up Photobooth and take a picture of your mug right now and send it to me, and I wanna see what a legit dildo baggins you must look alike, sir.
amir: Alright, are we done here?
jake: So it looks like you didn't just think of the dildo baggins-
amir:  Are we done here?
jake: Where are you going?
amir: I'm cutting out early, okay? It's the first nice day of the year, and you expect me to spend it indoors? No! I'm going home!
jake: So it sounds like you're still going to be indoors.
amir:  Woo! Lactose intolerant since '94 baby! I'm gonna puke!
jake:  Hey everybody, we just wanted to say thank you very much for becoming a fan--
amir:  Hold on a second, its not-- its not--

amir: Yo, yo bro. Eyes up here, OK? She's underage.
jake: I was looking at you.
amir: Yeah, well she's nineteen so.
jake: OK, well then she's not underage.
amir: She's under your age. She's under your age.
jake: That's not what that means though.
amir: You pervert, justifying it to me like I'm a judge.
jake: Shut up! How do you have a nineteen year old daughter?
amir: Trust me. You don't want to know. 
jake: You know what? You're probably right. So I actually don't--
amir: I walked into a sperm bank when I was nine--
jake: I thought we just agreed that we're going to--
amir: --ready to go 'cause, 'cause--
jake: --No!
amir: --cause I was strapped--
jake: Stop talking!
amir: 'cause--
jake: I don't want to know.
amir: I was strapped for cash.  And my illegal guardian was being a douche.
jake: They cannot possibly allow a nine year old to donate sperm.
amir: They don't. That's why I tried to adopt this dumb-ass orphan on a whim. Ready for the rub?
jake: No! You know what? I'm not. And by the way, I just looked it up on my work calendar on my phone, it's not Bring-Your-Daughter-To-Work Day.
amir: I'm trying to get her a freaking externship, OK? Do you realize how hard that is? Sorry for caring.
jake: You don't care. You just called her a dumb-ass orphan to her face.
amir: So anyway, I tried to adopt this dumb-ass orphan--
jake: Again.
amir: --but they wouldn't let nine year olds do that either.
jake: So how is she your daughter?
amir: I just met her at the freaking mall outside of a Hotdog-On-A-Stick and she called me 'daddy', demanding that I buy her lunch and take her and her friends on a six day shopping spree.
jake: Gotcha, so she's not your daughter, she's a con-artist.
emily: Wait, you keep your work calendar on your phone?
jake: Yeah.
emily: What a dork!
amir: Emily go to your room!  Sorry about that, I shouldn't have yelled.  Go get yourself a Jamba Juice, can I have a peanut butter mood, please? Thank you.  She is a burden but she means well.
jake: No, she doesn't.

amir: More calories than running?

amir: Check it.  Half the effort, twice the reward.
jake: Looks like none of the effort, your legs are just split over the treadmill.
amir: Yeah, well according to this machine, I've already burned 310 calories, so...twinkie time!
jake: That's a hotdog.
amir: It's cream filled!
jake: Twelve miles per hour, huh? Slow down!

amir: I'm goo--
jake: I'm stopping the machine.
amir: Want a sip?
jake: Is that soda?
amir: Better! It's an experimental energy drink that my cousin Leron is trying to copyright called 'lazer'.  It's like fifty hour energy, WOO!
jake: What's in it?
amir: He basically boils down like a case of soda pop down to its corn syrup, then he adds sugar in the raw--
jake: No, thank you.
amir: OK, well let me FINISH--with the ingredient list, sorry but you sound like the frickin' FDA.
jake: You know, I can tell you're not running.
amir: Yes, but can the ladies tell?
jake: Yup. A girl just came over here and said that if you're not going to use the treadmill then she wants to get on.
amir: OK, I'm sorry, but she was a fat bitch.
amir: Then he takes candy corn and melts it down to the raw, and a bottle of Aunt Jemima's maple syrup and melts it down to the raw.  Then he takes one of those big lollipops, that you can only get at Disney Land and melts it down--
jake: --to the raw.
amir: Yeah! To the frickin' raw!
amir: Here we go! Shoeless Joe Jackson!  Shoeless Joe Jackson back on the horse baby!
amir: Two times, two times in one session! What are the odds?
jake: Really high when you eat as many kielbasas as you do.
amir: I don't know, but I've been told...
jake: You gotta be quiet, dude.
amir: You gotta be quiet and mighty old. Sound off.
jake: Shh! Shh!
amir: Sound off.
jake: Shut up!
amir: Sound off, shh, shh, SHUT UP!

amir: No. No, we'll see about that, okay. You might be singing a different tune when I--
jake:  I'm just going to get someone else to do it.
amir: Good. Good, good, good. That'll actually give me some extra time to think about what ye shall owe me.
jake: Me shall not owe ye anything. I'm doing it myself.
amir:  Pick up my lunch every day for a month... doggie style. That's in your mouth.
jake: Wow. You shouldn't have picked a favor so similar to mine.
amir: Right?
jake: Which pretty much illustrates how unfair your favor is
amir: Every day for a year now! Missionary style. That's also in your mouth.
jake: Same as doggie style?
amir: Same exact same.
jake: Which was incorrect, by the way.
amir: Same incorrect same, then--
jake:  Okay, I'm going to go to the meeting. Don't get my lunch. Okay?
streeter: Great new, guys: Q3 in the books -- hit our numbers, thanks in no small part to Chelsea, who gave that fiery passionate speech at the investors meeting -- really lit a fire under everybody's butt, so a round of applause for Chelsea. Thank you.

jake: Sorry. I'll ask him to leave.
streeter: Why is that written backwards? Why is it backwards?
jake: He thinks the glass is a mirror.
amir: It's a mirror!
jake: It's not!
amir: Yeah, it is. And by the way, year one starts tomorrow, Hurwitz, so get your getting lunch shoes ready.

jake: Okay, sorry, I'm just trying to cheer you up!
amir : Who throws a shoe!?
jake: Hey! Look at me! Let's finish the dance, you and me.

Amir dances up to Murph, while he angrily stares back at Amir.
Eventually, Murph smiles and joins in dancing.
While the four of them are dancing, Murph's phone displays a text message from Mom, saying Call me. Grandma is dead.
The four of them jump in the air, and the video turns to a still.

jake: We're not!
amir: So...
amir:  Ohhhhhhhh! You can't torture me like that man! You can't torture me like that! You're making me weak kid. You're making me weak man.  I'm not eating carbs this month man and it's killing me to watch you eat that sandwich.
jake: Stop it with that voice. You know you're eating a sandwich right now, that has carbs. 
amir:  Not a lot. Not a lot!
jake: Yeah a lot and you said you weren't eating any.
amir: Okay well I'm hungry! Alright? And I need the energy and I'm eating around the carbs.
jake: You're not eating around the carbs, you're eating a foot-long sub and it looks like it has french fries in it.
amir:  You want some legit constructive criticism?
jake: How do you have a bagel now?
amir: You're not well travelled.  Bomb-shell. I know I'm sorry but I'm right okay. Take yourself on a me-cation. Go some place warm.
jake: It's 90 degrees out today.
amir:  Then go some place warmer.
jake: You're eating so many carbs. Like everything you're putting into your mouth is a carb.
amir: I'm on a diet. Okay. Have you ever heard of Atkins?
jake: I have. I don't think you have. Cos you're not doing it right.
amir:  I eat what I want, when I want, why... I want.
jake: That's not how any diet works alright? Especially Atkins.
amir: Why don't you tell my six pack how diets work baby!

amir: I know!
jake: Jesus Christ
amir: Shut up!
jake: So many rashes...
amir: Okay relax. It's all one big rash okay. This one's a rash, that one's eczema all along my sides that's adult impetigo.
jake: So that sounds like a lot of different rashes.
amir: Yeah, each rash is a sixer. A six pack of ab muscles so...
jake: Look now you're binge eating man!
amir:  Okay I eat when I'm happy!
jake: Well you look really upset.
amir:  That's cos my frickin abdomen feels like it was drenched in syrup two weeks ago and I haven't had the time to clean it off since. It's really dry and really itchy.
jake: Yeah well maybe you're allergic to some of the food that you're eating, ok.
amir: No, it's not that. It's from the syrup. I actually did drench my abdomen in syrup.
jake: So that wasn't a metaphor.
Amir. No. It was for real. I legit just arched my back and walked abdomen-first into a syrup fall, which is kinda like a waterfall but instead of water it's...
jake: Syrup 
amir: GRAVY! Okay! Don't cut me off.
sarah: Yeah you do do that Jake. You cut people off like, a lot. It's really...

INTRO
jake: Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir. Turn your cellphone off.
amir: I'm playing a game!
jake: I know.
murph: Why don't we just come back later?
jake: 'Cuz I'm good at juggling now, Murph, alright? I'm just nervous.
sarah: You're not even close.
jake: Now I'm pissed. I'm obviously not going to be a good juggler if I'm pissed. Don't leave! Don't leave! Please don't leave. Here, I'll do it.
amir : We caught the bitch! We caught the bitch!
jake: What are you talking about?
amir: Osama bin Hidin'. Osama bin Not.
sarah: He was hiding.
amir: Well now he's not. We're gonna put him on trial, and I'm gonna grill him.  George Foreman style. AKA with onions.
murph: That's not George Foreman style.
jake: Sorry, why do you think you would be the one to interrogate Osama bin Laden?
amir: Because he's guilty
jake: He's dead.
amir: As charged, and I'm gonna bring him there.
murph: No, like he's actually dead.
amir: What?
jake: How do you hear about this story and not know he was dead?
amir: I saw a two month old New York Post on the subway this morning with his face on it and figured we had caught the bitch, right? Put a net around him and dragged his ass to Yankees Stadium, put him on trial in front of the fearless fans of Bronx's Alpha, parked his car in the Harvard yard, took him to the square.
jake: That's Boston.
amir: Only it wasn't Osama bin Laden; it was my dad. And it wasn't Yankees Stadium, either, it was like my elementary school and I was naked.
jake: Ok, so now you're talking about like a dream you had, did you pass out or something?
amir: Mhm. Yeah I fainted, twice. Today, actually. Once at my aunt's condo on the way over here in a bowl of cereal, and another on like a subway platform, and when I came to there were 35 police officers looking down on me, told me I missed the train by like half an inch. I was this close-
jake: Alright, stop talking. You're saying, like a million different things at once and the only person who can juggle that many things at once is named yours truly.
jake: Alright leave! Everybody just leave, leave, alright? I'll make a video of me juggling, but for now; screw you guys, you need to go home. Alright, Murph, you're lucky you're a bitch, that would've hit you square. You got your bitch shield up, dude.
jake : Ow! Alright. Ow! Ah! Ah! Ow! Murph! I was joking!

jake: How much was the headset?
amir: Doesn't matter. It's not yours, I don't see why you care.
jake: You just asked me to talk to you about it. Okay, I'm making conversation about the headset.
amir: I just don't get why the second I get something as chill as a headset you're all up in my snatch about it.
jake: You begged me repeatedly to talk to you about it. I don't know why you bought one because you never get calls.
amir: Correction, never get calls.
jake: That's what I said.
amir: Never got calls, then.
jake: What are you talking about?
amir: It's called I wanted people to call me on my new headset so I left my phone number in a gas station bathroom, okay? But I didn't
want to soft sell it so i wrote for a good time, call: in lipstick above it.  Wow!
jake: It's not called that. Don't say it's called this, like it's a thing other people do
amir: Hello?
jake: Gotta change that ringtone.
amir: I'm wearing a shirt, I guess. Uh, yeah I'm hard, and it is a little wet. How did you even know I had a cyst?
jake: Hang up man.
amir: Hello? Hello?  Anyway where were we? Oh right I remember where you were, 100%, firmly placed, inside of, my snatch.
jake: Stop saying snatch. Who just called you?
amir: None of your bitchness.
jake: It actually is my bitchness because you're running a phone sex hotline at workand now my phone's ringing. Did you post my number
too?
amir: I don't think... no.
jake: Okay well it's coming from an area code that I don't recognize.
amir: 732?
jake: Yeah.
amir: Jersey. I mean, is it?
jake: Okay well, yeah, well I guess you spend a lot of time in New Jersey on the weekends.
amir: Sometimes I spend gas station time there, but like nothing more than that.
jake: Okay, well I'm going to know if you posted my number if I answer this and it's somebody that I don't know asking me what I'm
wearing.
amir: Which is why I swear to god that I didn't leave your phone number.
jake:  Hello?  Yeah. That guy's jerking off.
amir: I left your phone number. I just remembered and I wanted to come clean because the idea of me not telling you was eating me up
inside. I just thought you wanted some company while you were all up in my sand.
jake: That's not what you were saying before man.
amir: I forgot it for half a second but then I remembered it: my sa...
jake: It was snatch.
amir: Dammit, no. It wasn't that, but you get the prize for getting it the closest.
jake: That was it.
amir: No, that wasn't it. I already gave you the prize, stop lobbying for more.  Hello? Uh... I don't know why don't you
ask Jake what it smells like, he's currently in it.  He's asking me about my
jake: Snatch.
amir: Snatch, yeah.
jake: Got it.
INTRO Amir - Hey, you're watching Amir and Jake.
Jake - What?
Amir - Let's just switch it up a little.
Jake -  No.
Amir - OW.
amir: Blato!
jake: New business card. Nice.
amir: Not just any business card. My business card.
jake: I know. I didn't think you're were carrying around--
amir: My business card.
jake: --like some random business card.
amir: My business card.
jake: OK, it's blank.
amir:  It's blank, or is it invisible ink?  Here we go.  Suddenly, the card comes to life.
jake: Not ye-
amir: Not yet!  Not yet.
jake: Don't get mad, you're getting really defensive really early on in this conversation.
amir: It's already starting to work. 
jake: Just chill out. It's not actually. It's pretty slow, it's--
amir: It's fast! OK, if you know anything about invisible ink.
jake: I don't.
amir: Well I do and this is fast. This is considered lightning fast in the industry. Starting to--
jake: OK, well, yeah, I understand that you carry around a spritzer all the time but how is anybody else--
amir: What?
jake: I'm in the middle of talking, don't say 'what' to interrupt me, OK? You're--
amir: You're mumbling, OK? 
jake: --you're getting, you're getting defensive. How is anybody else going to know to spray the card with water?
amir: Well, it's not with water, OK? It's vinegar.  And the instructions are written   on the card once you've spritz it, oooh, that was tough.
jake: Yeah, that actually was tough. And by the way, nothing has appeared on the card yet.
amir: OK, you're just being a dick because you think this was a waste of $3000.
jake: I would have thought it was a waste if you got it for free.
amir: A good business card should one: display pertinent information prominently, two: be simple and clean and three: be easily readable.
jake: I agree. It's weird that you know all that stuff--
amir: A GREAT business card should--
jake: OK.
amir: --one: make you earn that information, two: invisible ink, preferable but not necessary--
jake: Definitely not necessary.
amir: --and three: leave a lot to the imagination.
jake: Nothing showed up yet.
amir: It's showing up.
jake: Try not shaking it.
amir:  OK, you know what? You have a lot of dumb ideas too but I don't call you out on them because you're my friend and at least you're trying and I want to see you happy.
jake: All right. You're right. I'm sorry. Hey look, it just showed up.  Tweet at me bitches, you know a player when you see one.
amir: Yeah.
jake: Doesn't have your twitter name.
amir:  Which is fine, right?
jake: That's fine. That's good. That's cool. All right, good talk. What do you say we start the day, huh?
amir: Absolutely.
jake: Let's do it.
amir: Lunch?
jake: Uh, it's still 9AM but . . . all right, good talk. Take it easy man.
amir:  Take it easy man.  This could actually work--
jake: Go to your desk, man.
amir: Whoa, just got my first business card tweet.
jake: Hey, really?
amir: Yeah, it's from you. 
jake: What's it say, man?

jake: I don't want you to shave a cat.
amir: That's not what I asked you
jake: Hey, one last thing...
amir: Yeah?
jake: Would you at least consider shaving your nipples?
Amir moves his towel to reveal nipple hair.
amir: No! 
jake: You don't just want to shave your soul patch, right?
amir: I don't know, haven't decided yet.
jake: Alright.
amit: But you decided, to be a queen douche about it.
jake: Hey, look, I'm being nice, okay? I'm teaching you to shave right now. And you're 28-years-old so you should know or your dad should've taught you.
amir:  I know. Yeah, I know, I know, I know, I know. I know, I know, I know, I know! I know already, I said I know! Jesus, you don't have to be a queen douche about it.

jake: Yeah, just cause the hair is so long 
amir: Brown, I know right?
jake: No, long, is what I was going to say.
amir: Yeah, that too.
jake: That only.
Jake and Amir are shaving again.
amir: Hm, this is easy.
jake: Yup.
amir: Would it be harder or easier if I had legit cat fur on my face though?
Jake stops shaving.
jake: I really don't want you to shave a cat, okay?
amir: Don't tell me what to do, okay?
jake: It'd be harder with cat fur.
amir: I'll just get a sharper razor then.
Amir is moving his stomach.
amir: Look at that.
jake: Don't be proud of your body, okay?
Jake and Amir are shaving again.
amir: Do they make circular razors?
jake: No.

jake: I already said no, man. You don't have to specify.
Amir continues to shave in silence.
amir: I'm gonna shave a cat.
jake: I know.
jake: Hey, I have a question, how do you get this nipple hair so soft?
Jake rips the hair off of one of Amir's nipples and Amir screams.
Jake and Amir are shaving together.
jake: Okay, just like that, slowly, carefully.
Amir nicks himself.
amir: Ooh, nicked myself a little bit.
Jake and Amir continue to shave. Amir is holding the towel to his bloody cut.
jake: Okay, slowly, carefully.
amir: Mmhmm.
jake: You alright? Watch me do it.
Amir nicks himself again.
amir: Ooh, okay. Two for two!
Amir is holding the towel around his bloody neck.
jake: Okay, just do me a favor? Keep your razor away from your face, watch how slow I'm going. Just like this.
Jake demonstrates how to shave.
amir: I was going that slowly.
jake: Just like this. You put pressure on that.
Amir is covered in blood.
jake: Okay, tell me this goat isn't chief, and I'll shave it off right now.
amir: It's not chief.
jake: Oh, you don't know jack! Shaving it.
Amir is covered in his own blood.
amir: You know, if you think this is funny...

amir:  Stop!
jake: No no no no no, not you, him. Translate that.
amir: I mean, c'mon, she pretty much gets it.
jake: She pretty much doesn't, okay? She stopped laughing.
amir: Ya, cause that was a bad joke.
jake: It wasn't a joke.
rachel:  I'm sorry, I missed the train. I must look terrible.
amir: She missed the train and had to run here, so she feels gross and ugly.
jake: No, no, you're beautiful. Tell her she's beautiful.
amir: Well, then you'll look a little desparate, so...
jake: Okay, well just say it.
amir: Well, she's probably just fishing for compliments, trust me dude, you do not
jake: Why did I even invite you here then, okay? Just say that to her.
amir:  You're just fishing for compliments. You don't look good.
jake: What did you say to her?
amir: Nothing we both don't already think.
jake: Just tell her that I want to take her out to dinner tonight.
amir:  Jake says don't expect him to pay, okay? You guys are splittin' the bill. Even in Israel, people are going Dutch.
jake: Hey, dude?
amir: I mean, it's 2011, so stop waiting for a--
jake: Buddy, you're talking in English and you're not saying what I said! Alright? You're an asshole!
jake: Don't say that to her.
amir:  You look pretty.
jake: No! No, look at me. No.
rachel: Goodbye! 
jake: Hey!  What are you doing?  Hey, Rachel, wait.
jake: Look, you're mad at me for all of the wrong reasons.
rachel: I'm mad at you because you saw me speaking Hebrew at a bar and hit on me, demanding that I come meet you here at this park, that you'd have a translator. I told you I spoke English well, and you laughed, saying that it was a cute attempt at speaking normal.
jake: It was.
rachel: I figured I'd come here for a free meal, but you are so unbearable to be around, that it's not worth it! Though I am happy that you're not wearing that ugly fedora anymore. And those dog tags.
jake: I'm still wearing the dog tags, alright? But you know what, I'm glad that this isn't gonna work out because fashion is the #1 most important thing in my life, and you don't got it.  So peace out.
rachel: Is that a watch?
jake: It's a leather band, sister.
rachel: Ugh. 
jake: Is that funny?  Way to go man, you blew that for me, she's a Lesbian.
amir: I blew it, or she's a Lesbian?
jake: Both, to be honest.  Tell me, what do you think about
amir: Not stylin'.
jake: Then help me take it off!
amir: Your hand is purple.
jake: Ya, cause it's small. I stole the belt off my sister's frickin' doll, dude.

amir: Seventh Heaven: Kia Sorento, fire engine red, real cherry.
jake: That's such a random car..
amir: Number Six: Pick up chicks in whatever my twix shaped dick can do arithmetic in.. Translation, who gives a fudge? The car is meaningless when you're getting riproaringly blazed, might as well be a kite 'cause I'm that high. I'm stoned.
jake: Right, if the car is meaningless then how are there five more cars?
amir: Number five: mitsubishi galant, yellow with black slim for the man getting mad trim.
jake: Black slim?!
amir: Roll up to a joint and roll up a joint. Let's clam bake this baked clam on a glazed ham.
four: It.. don't..
jake: Matter right? As long as you're smoking that sticky ass gaunge in a sticky ass bong then nothing can go wrong, the car doesn't mean anything.
Amir makes odd hand movement and serious face
jake: Weed.
amir: Exactomundo! Though it should be a '99 Volvo V70, cherry green, lease to own. Number three is a toyota yaris. Lemon yellow, like a lemon cello, a mellow cello for this mellow fellow. Two is a Nissan quest and one don't matter, cause guess what? whispers Yeah...

pat and sarah: Chris Nowth.
pat: You saw him too!
sarah: No, you just keep talking about this.
amir: Hey.
sarah: Hey!
amir: Sorry, uh, got to go take a shit.
pat: Come on.
amir: But Jake's gift hath arrived. So whenever you guys get a chance, pay the peeper! 
sarah: How much do we owe you?
amir: Huh?
pat: For the gift.  How much do we owe you?
amir: Well, uh, like I said, I ended up going for the deluxe package--
pat: You never said that.
amir: --So uh--
pat: You never SAID THAT!
amir: That changed the price by just a hair. So uh.
sarah: What the deluxe package?
amir: Yeah! Well you know how I was deciding between the headphone thing and the deluxe package?
pat: No.
amir: Yeah, well, OK, sorry, I really, uhh, I got to go take a shit. But I was deciding between the headphones and the deluxe package and I ended up saying 'eff it, you only turn 26 once, I went balls to the wall and I got the deluxe package, so that's--
sarah: Amir, you told us you were just going to get him headphones.
amir: Umm, sorry, like...whaaa--
pat: Is that a sincere apology?
amir: I don't kn--Yeah. It is. Sorry, I'm like, ugh, really backed up and loopy right now.  So I'm like sort of saying one thing but meaning another.  Yeah, it was sincere. What's your excuse for being a D-bag though?
sarah: OK, it's fine. How much do we owe you?
amir: Well. Like I said, since I ended up getting the deluxe package--
sarah: Stop saying deluxe package.
amir: --The sum ended up falling somewhere in the neighborhood of like, god, I want to say like fourteen six a person.
sarah: Fourteen six?
amir: Yeah, fourteen thousand six hundred dollars, but now I really have to go because I'm legit about to diarrhea my jeans.
sarah: OK, Amir, we're not paying you $14,000!
pat: I was not even on board for the headphones.
amir: Well, it's an all inclusive thing, OK? It's a deluxe package, that's the MacBook Air, the wine, you know, two days in the ring with a former pro, plus the plane tickets to Espaa, so, it's a little bit much, but like, when he gets back we're going to have to divide up the receipts, see how much the food and wine cost, because that was not included.  Neither was the boxing thing, actually.
pat: So it's not all inclusive!
amir: No man, it's not all inclusive, but I think--
amir: AH!
jake: Hey guys, what's going on?
amir: Jake. What's up, man? What were we talking about? Sports?
sarah: Jake, Amir bought you this really expensive birthday present and --
jake: Come on, man.
sarah: --now he's--
jake: Did you guy seriously get me the deluxe package??
amir: It was going to be a surprise!  Yeah!
jake: That is me and Reddick Bowe in the boxing ring, for two days!  Woo!
sarah: Umm, listen Jake--
jake: You guys, can I just let you in on a little secret? Real fast. I honestly thought I heard you say you were getting me headphones and I ran to the bathroom and I cried my eyes out. I just wept openly because I was that pissed, I was like 'these chumps call themselves my friends and they're getting me a lame-ass birthday gift?'--
amir: No way.
jake: --no computer, no wine, no Espaa, and now here we are, I feel like an ass because you guys are obviously my best friends!
pat: So you cry when you don't get the gift that you want?
jake: Yeah, for like a couple of minutes!
amir: Who doesn't?
jake: But we're fine now because I got what I want.  What smells like shit?

jake: You're an asshole.
amir: Why is it when you pick up a hobby, you're, like, a nice guy, but when I do it, I'm an asshole?
jake: I have this theory that you're, like, such a bad combination of mean-spirited and dumb that everything you do makes you an asshole.
amir: Are you just mad at me because I haven't done any work in the last couple days?
jake: Yes.
amir: Or is it that I'm so good at singing now--
jake: It's the first one.
amir: --that it makes everything you do seem--... what's the word I'm thinking of? Uh, I-- I'm so good at something, that you are now...
jake: It's the work one.
amir: ...bad.
jake: Bad. Wow, that was the word you were looking for? It was bad?
amir: 'Cuz if it's the first one--
jake: It is.
amir: --I'll shut up...
jake: Thank you.
amir: ...but if it's the second one--
jake: I'm so surprised at how many times I've had to tell you it's the first one.
amir: Okay, fine, new rule, then: if it's the first one, we're good. But if it's the second one, it's the opposite of good. It's, um...
lerrence: Bad!
amir: Don't butt in, Lerrence.
jake: Sorry--... who named you Lerrence?
lerrence: A fisherman found me when I was nineteen years old. He named me Lerrence, and he raised me.
jake: You know, by nineteen, you really should've been pretty much raised.
lerrence: Yeah, but--
jake: And named.
lerrence: That's fair. That's more then fair.

jake: Herself?
amir: Himself, I said.
jake: No, you didn't.
amir: Turns out, he couldn't. Wuh-oh, no surprise there. Leron's a coward and a thief. Good thing his buddy Travin was right around the corner, and he fixed me up right good! Only problem is: he's concussed.
jake: How?
amir: Sittin' in the operating chair, I'm this terrible combination of pissed and scared, kickin' my legs willy-nilly like a jackrabbit over water, but Lee and Trav were gung-ho about the project, not ready to relent. Luckily for me, Trav  is a frickin' geezer.

jake: Like a tab?

jake: So why would you--
amir: So drop it.
jake: Your gums are bleeding, man.
amir: Bleeding? ...Or am I just eating a red velvet cupcake?
jake: Bleeding.

jake: You're slowing us down.
amir: That's true.
amir:  ...like, we like to party, we like the party...
amir: Oh!  Here for the talent show?
jake: You know I'm not here for the talent show, Man.
amir: Well, then ya can just beat it, 'cause everyone here  got talent.
jake: Nobody showed up, okay?  Be at peace with that.
amir: I dunno where I went wrong, Man.
jake: If you're venting, I will stop and let ya vent
amir: It's just, like, one of those things where, like, nobody's specifically to blame.
jake: N-no, you're specifically to blame, just because the fliers that you put up where um at best blatantly racist and at worst...illegal.
amir: Yeah, well, got people talking, didn't it?
jake: Mostly about how appalled they were.  I mean, you wrote a 'w' on each one of your butt cheeks, bent over, and took an incredibly high res photo of your anus so it spelled "wow".
amir: Correctly.
jake: Not impressive.
amir: But provocative, like Nike's Write The Future campaign which got people into soccer.
jake: Why did you build the entire thing as The World's First Non-Filipino Talent Show?
amir: What?
jake: Did you not hear me or are you actually confused?
amir:  Both I guess.
jake: In every e-mail you sent out, every tweet ya tweeted, every Facebook message that you bombarded everyone in the office with, you said "The World's First  Non-Filipino Talent Show.
amir: Right...
jake: So you remember?
amir: Yeah, just to keep the Filipinos at bay.
jake: Why?  There's only one Filipino guy in our entire office.  Why would you call him out like that?  By the way, he's a really great juggler.
amir: He's alright, yeah he auditioned, he was just like, I dunno, a lot of it was stuff I've seen before; three ball, four ball, five ball...
jake: What were you gonna do?
amir: Great question!  Daily show type theatrics only a little bit eh right of center, a lot of smoke and mirrors and political potty humor stuff, with a pop culture slant geared toward skewering the left.
jake: That makes no sense.
amir: I was gonna swallow a kielbasa and puke all over the front row, like frickin' Gallagher or something.
jake: Alright, I used to think you were like misunderstood, but deep down a good guy
amir: Thank-you.
jake: Y'know, well let me finish
amir: I appreciate that.
jake: I appreciate that you appreciate it,
amir: Yeah...
jake: but I'm not done talking.
amir: I just-I really needed to hear that positive stuff because
jake:   Okay, well, Ii just want you to know that I'm not trying to comfort you and I might actually insult you by the time I'm done talking.
amir: This talent show
jake: You...
amir: just didn't go well

class with me which should be fine cos that's sort of a two person thing...
jake: Why are you signing up for all these classes?
amir: Cos I love to learn, I love to yearn and most of all I love to make money.

amir: Yeah so did I. Tried to, failed, no big deal. It's not like you noticed.
jake: I did notice, I called you out on it. How much money have you spent on these "deals"?
amir: Spent or saved?
jake: Spent.
amir: 21,000 dollars.
jake: Oh my god, give me your credit card.
amir: But I've saved 40,000 which means I've made -
jake: No it doesn't.
amir: - 100,000.

jake: About what, the spelling?
amir: About  everything!
jake: Ok, no, because none of the letters were correct, and also, you know, he's not being that reckless with his suitcase 'cause he's standing pretty close to it, in a building, with security, surrounded by regular, employed adults.

amir: You must be a clock, 'cause you're watching, Jake and Amir!  That made sense!
jake:  Whoa, bad!
jake:  Ohh, Whoa! Any idea why I went to the bathroom and I came back and have 31 emails?
amir: 'Cause you had to take a shit? I mean, like, I'm not gonna keep track....
jake: No, I mean any idea why I got all these emails? Each one is a Facebook notification!
amir: No idea! But in case I don't see ya, good afternoon, good evening, and good night!
jake: 31 comments, all made in the last two and a half minutes, on a picture of us that you uploaded.
amir: Truman show....
jake: Got it, do any of these sound familiar?  "Really thinking about making this my Facebook profile pic, somebody please please talk me into it."
amir: Not gonna do it! 
jake: Sounds like you DO wanna do it, 'cause you respond to your own comment with, "Will somebody give me the confidence to make this my prof pic? Spiritually, I'm an ox , I'm ready to make the move. Emotionally, I'm nowhere near where I need to be."  Then you reply, again: I'm in tears , I'm a baby in each one of your arms, let me suckle on your tit and drink that sweet sweet confidence juice."  None of those words, not a single one, was spelled correctly!  You respond, AGAIN to your own comment, "You know what? Gotta trust your gut sometime, go fuck yourself society,  this picture is a huge middle finger pointed at each and every one of you,  and guess what? Don't worry 'cause that middle finger is up your ass and around the corner!"  Then society SHOULD worry....
jake: Then you comment, ONE more time, "Didn't have el huevos to pull the trigger, wow I am a weak ass nerd!"
amir: Yeah, I AM a weak ass nerd.
jake: HOW are you this insecure?
amir: I just didn't wanna switch it up to something  unpopular.
jake: Right, 'cause your current picture of Calvin pissing on a picture of A-Rod kissing Cameron Diaz at the Super Bowl is really popular.
amir: OK, yeah, it was at the time!
jake: STOP talking in that NASALLY, GRATING voice!
jake: Alright, I feel myself getting angry and worked up, and my therapist says to not let this stuff affect me, so I'm just gonna unsubscribe from Facebook notifications, shut my eyes, and count to ten.... One....
amir: Fortune favors the bold!
jake: ....Two.... that is NOT a smart thing to say right now, but ha haa! I DON'T care! I'm smiling, my brain thinks I'm happy! I'm fine! Three four! Five...
amir: Rest assured....
jake:  .... Yeah! Usually people say something else after they say "rest assured," but I don't care! Not at all! Six! Seven, eight!
amir: Nah.... they don't....
jake: YES! THEY DO! OK, it's fine, it shouldn't DOESN'T bother me! Nine!
amir: Glue.

jake: First comment, from YOU: "Shitty profile change!"
amir: I shouldn't have done it!
Intro
jake: You're watching Jake and, wow, your nose is bleeding a lot.
amir: OH, barely...
amir: Hey bud, good news, bad news. Which one you want first?
jake: No news.
amir: Well no news is good news so we'll start with the bad. My dad is pissed at us, and this time, it is earned.
jake: What?
amir: OK, but the good news is he doesn't have a reason to be as pissed as he is.
jake: You said it was earned.
amir: He's steaming like hot shit on a plate of ice, but the good news is-
jake: You just said the good news.
amir: The good news is he don't matter, cause we don't care.
jake: I care.
amir: You should, because he's mostly pissed at you.
jake: I didn't do anything.
amir: Well, you were kind of a bitch to his mom in that letter you wrote that I wrote for you.
jake: I didn't write a letter!
amir: Tell that to my dad.
jake: I want to.
amir: I wouldn't, not right now atleast, he probably wouldn't even talk to you, because he's sorta paying out of pocket for that whole giraffe rental thing.
jake: I didn't rent a giraffe.
amir: Tell that to my dad, man.
jake: I wanna tell him everything!
amir: Sorry, but you gotta take a hit on that, ok?
jake: It sounds like i'm taking a hit on everything.
amir: Untrue! ok i'm taking a hit on the duck thing, the high school track fiasco thing, and the second duck thing.
jake: Take a hit on all the things!
amir: No way, because the orphanage thing, that wasn't even my idea.
jake: It wasn't mine!
amir: Well, it kinda stemmed from the first duck thing which, correct if i'm wrong you said you'd take the hit on.
jake: No, you are wrong, you said you were gonna take the hit on it.
amir: No, I said the second duck thing.
jake: You said both. You said the first duck thing, the high school track thing and the second duck thing.
amir: Listen man, we're in this together right now ok, our lives are like we're intertwined.
jake: Why am I getting a phone call?
amir: Is that from Venezuela?
jake: I don't think so, it's a local number.
amir: Yeah that's Venezuela. laughs He's a transvestite bouncer at bar we, let's just say we burned it down last night.
jake: What did we actually do?
amir: We burned it down last night.
jake: Awesome alright stop talking to me because I don't want to be implicated any more than I already am
chicken man: speaks question in asian language holding a roast duck
amir: Ohhh, right.
jake: Lemme guess, the duck thing.
amir: Very wrong, the second duck thing.
jake: So not very wrong.
chicken man: yelling at Jake in asian language for rest of video
jake: I- what
amir: OH woah woah woah ok-
jake: You're mad at him! You're mad at him, not me! Hey I didn't do anything!
amir: It's fine it's fine it's fine!
amir: You're watching Jake and Amir,  my pretties.
jake: What is that?
amir: I'm a witch!
jake: Got it.
jake: Alright, let me explain the economic crisis to you, so you don't embarrass yourself in another meeting.
amir: Ok, I thought I handled myself with gravity and poise.
jake: You took out a hundred dollar bill, lit it on fire, and then tried to light a cigar with it; you failed, you burned yourself pretty badly, and you burned Karen really badly.
amir: Ok, she was loving it.
jake: She was already upset because she lost half of her retirement fund in the last three months.
amir: Yeah, that's what you get for investing in cock futures.
jake: She didn't invest in cock futures, ok? nobody is inve.. What is a cock future?
So the government needed to raise the debt ceiling in order to pay back billions of dollars in foreign loans. 
amir: Woah woah slow down I wasn't listening.
jake: Slow down or you weren't listening?
amir: What's the difference?
jake: Well one implies you were giving some effort but I was just talking too fast, the other one is just that you're being an asshole Interrupted by Amir
amir: Woah woah slow down!
jake: So it was the second one?
amir: Second WHAT!
jake: You then rolled up a hundred dollar bill, shoved it in Karens ear and lit the tip of it on fire, screaming Enjoy this ear candle you dumb bitch, it's half the price of a cock future and unlike you it's guaranteed to blow smoke up my ass.
amir: Yeah, which got a huge laugh.
jake: A lot of people tried to tackle you.
amir: So why doesn't Obama just like cut a check and call it a day?
jake: You think Obama would be the one to cut a check? Amir shrugs They needed more than a Trillion dollars.
amir: Oh a trillion. Which is?
jake: A thousand billion
amir: Right. Which is?
jake: A thousand million, which is a thousand thousand, which is a thousand dollars, which is how much four chicken nuggets cost.
amir: Got it. 
jake: Where did you get that?
 Security came to escort you out; you got down on your hands and knees and begged Karen for just one of her cock futures, you said: I'm sure my dad would be disappointed to see me grovelling, but the look in his eyes when I show him I'm the certified owned of a cock future, would surely erase 28 years of disapproval.
amir: I'm a coward and a fool! .. I feel like the word staunch was co opted by the right, I mean like you can be a staunch Republican, but you can't be a staunch Democrat? like who made those rules   
jake: You can be a staunch Democrat  
amir: I don't interrupt you, ok, I don't interrupt your stand ups so don't interrupt mine, sorry but..
jake: You do interrupt me a lot, not necessarily during my stand up  
amir: Name one time I interrupted you.
jake: You're interrupting me right now 
amir: Name one time!
jake: It's happening right now  , this is interruption!
amir: I feel like we don't need money if everyone just decided to use..
jake: I know, Chucky Cheese tokens instead of money, right, you said that maybe too much during the meeting.
amir:  Are you ticklish?
jake: Yes, I'm very ticklish but your hands are so cold, and wet and clammy that I'm just grossed out..
You then pissed yourself, and you were dragged out of the meeting a second time, while you were screaming The audacity of NOPE, which sounds like some weird tea party slogan.
amir: I'm a member.
jake:  Yeah, like that feels like I'm being poked with cold crab claws.
amir:  Alright come on, just let go man.
jake: You did not learn your lesson yet. That'll be 300$ on the day!
Ok, then so even though the debt ceiling was raised, our credit rating dropped so the stocks tanked.
amir: Yeah, that's why I keep my money in a freaking box, man.
jake: That's not smart.
amir: Yeah, well didn't you lose money this year?
jake: Yes.
amir: .. and in 2008?
jake: Right i did but...
amir: Well my box didn't depreciate in value, ok, I actually made more money investing in Nothing .
jake: Fine, where's your box?
amir: Here's a quiz.. I lost it.
jake: So then from inside the meeting we heard you threaten to make your face red until you passed out, which I guess you did, because then nobody heard from you for 30 minutes.
amir: Yeah, which felt like like a second on my end.
jake: Right, because you had stopped breathing.
amir: For like a second on my end.
jake: Yes, on your end, but like for 30 minutes in real life.
jake: Booyakasha?
amir: Borat, yeah. Ok, so how do you know so much?
jake: Newspapers, alright, it's not hard to stay informed; you read an hour a day, New York Times, Wall Street Journal..
amir: How do you actually know so much?
jake: Daily show.. I watch the Colbert Report.
amir: Yeah.. Comedy shows.

)
amir: Another day
jake: Go back
amir: at the races lemme finish.
jake: Go back to the hospital.
amir: Thanks, but no thanks. I'd rather take my chances with the lung murmur, and the spleen thingamajig, and my third and fourth
infected nipple.
jake: That's not intelligent. Sounds like you have a lot of health issues.
amir: You know what the big issue is? I have a fear of commitment. As in I can't committo getting a shot.
jake: Sounds like you're afraid of getting shots.
amir: I'm not a pussy!
jake: You're not intelligent. You have a lot of health issues and you're forgoing treatment.
amir: Okay, let me put it this way: would you let a doctor buttf**k you?
jake: That couldn't have
amir: Answer the question.
jake: You're clearly
amir: Would you let a doctor buttf**k you?
jake: Was that happening at your hospital?
amir: I wasn't gonna take the risk! Okay, that's why I flew over the cuckoo's nest! You're looking at one Get out of Jail Free tard
. And guess what? This one? It's for real.
jake: Why tack that on at the end of the sentence?
amir: What?
both in unison: This one's for real.
amir: Yeah, it's for real!
jake: I was on board with the Get out of Jail Free tard, that was sorta clever.
amir: Yeah.
jake: But you didn't get out of jail for free.
amir: I'm not gonna let some quack in a van hack me up in a can for fifty bucks. No way, that's not me, okay? And this one's for real.
jake: Tell you what: I'm just gonna know everything you say from now on is gonna be for real.
amir: It's for real, yeah.
jake: Yeah, so don't say it anymore.
amir: Okay.
jake: I'm not saying you should let somebody hack you up in a van.
amir: Okay well, Tranlyn comes in with a fricking t
jake: Stop, I can already tell you're having Leron's friends operate on you.
amir: Try nottry not 'peratingor noperting on mehe's not operating
jake: Yeah I got
amir: try not-perat
jake: Time's up, you're not gonna bring the pun home.
amir: I'm gonna get there, okay!
jake: You tried
amir: I'm gonna nail it! How's that for funny?
jake: I don't think it would have been funny even if you did nail it.
amir: I was gonna nail it.
jake: No, nailing it is like getting it right the first time.
amir: Right.
jake: So there's no way you could have nailed it.
amir: Okay, well I'm sorry I'm not good with wordplay right now, but I'm kinda... I'm bleeding out, man.
jake: What?
amir: I faked the anesthesia! Yeah! I blew into the tube instead of sucking in, alright? First sign of a cut I start squealing like a
pig in the mud.
jake: Oh my god.
amir: I'm down to yell Gotcha!, but turns out it hurt like a bleach. So the yolk's on me, and this time
jake: It's for real. Yeah, okay.
amir: Exactly right. So I start picking out the IVs, right, squirting blood on the one get well card that I made for myself. How
embarrassing is that? Then I leap out of the chair, knock Tranlyn's head together with a nurse's, they're concussed, and I hop out of
the van unscathed.
jake: You're bleeding from so many parts of your body.
amir: I'm a little bit scathed, okay. But once I get this  thing closed up, I'll be fine.
jake: Oh my god! No!
amir: What? It's much worse than it looks.

rick fox:  One rooster, one chick.  smooch I'm bored...I'm bored!
amir: You asked me to do this!
rick fox: I was not talking to you!
amir: I know!...who were you talking to then?
rick fox:  Don't worry about it. Did you get into the Egg Box yet?
amir: You mean this file cabinet?
rick fox: What'd I say?
amir: You said Egg Box. You said did you get into his Egg Box yet. And no I didn't get into his Egg Box cause I think you welded it shut with that little torch of yours.
rick fox:  I was trying to break the lock.
amir:  I know; and I was trying to tell you that it wasn't locked.
rick fox: Look, in that box right there is where Jake keeps eggs.
amir:  Why do you think that!? What do you think that?
rick fox:  Otherwise, why would it be locked?
amir:  It wasn't locked man, remember! Uhhh...you're haha; you're really frustrating today, Rick Fox. Like it's cool that you come by, cause like you're tall and like-
rick fox: Handsome.
amir: Famous. Ah, but uh, i-it's a little too much right now-ha.
rick fox: Hey look, look, look, look, look. When's Jake gettin' back from lunch?
amir: Lunch?
rick fox: Yeah, when's he gettin' back from lunch? EGG SALAD. What?
amir: What!? What are you... Mmmm. Ok, you're starting to freak me out. Do you remember like five minutes ago you tied up Jake and locked him in the supply closet? 
jake:  This is insane! Rick Fox did this to me!
amir: Why'd you steal his clothes by the way?
rick fox:  Look that kool katt tried to hot dog with a low V.
amir: I guess...
rick fox:  Look.  You got two options.
amir: Ok.
rick fox: One, pay me all the money you owe me. Or two , break in there and get me all the eggs in the world.
amir: Ok you're the one who told me to bet on all those NBA games, man, remember!? And then you're like oh the NBA's locked out this season , so all those bets are an instant loss!
rick fox: Yeah, instant loss.
amir: By the way, there might not be any eggs in here, ok; let alone, I think you said, all the eggs in the world. So. Just trying to temper your expectations, ya know?  Oh!
rick fox: The only thing tempered right now is you!
amir: Yeah, uh, I don't know what that means.
rick fox:  Do you want to join Jake for lunch?
amir: Usually, yeah, but not the way you mean it with the c-hand and the eyeeeees! Hah.
jake:  Somebody has to be able to hear me! This closet's really close to a lot of people!
rick fox: Look, I don't wanna be the bad guy. Ok, that's just the way it is. I married a chicken.
amir: What?
rick fox: What?
amir: You married a chicken?
rick fox: Wha-?
amir: You said you married-
rick fox: Listen!
amir: I do listen. I heard what you said; you said you married-
rick fox:  You never listen!
amir:  You said you married-
rick fox: No...No...
amir: I'm so sorry.
rick fox: No.
amir: Oh God.
rick fox:  No!
amir: Oh no.
rick fox: NO!
amir: Oh!
rick fox:  NOOO! choking sound
amir:  Hey, sorry-
jake: Ahhh, your dick's small!
jake: You're watching Jake and Amir.
amir: Now do it with some attitude!
jake: Don't tickle me!
jake: Hey, just got your Kickstarter email.
amir: If you don't have something to say, don't say it, okay? Don't feel like you have to fill every silence with your stupid voice just because--
jake: Okay, don't just repeat things that I say. It makes sense when I say them to you.
amir: Then we agree...to disagree...about agreeing. Oh!
jake: Kickstarter is meant for like meaningful projects, like albums or films.
amir: I know.
jake: You know that?
amir: Yeah.
jake: So you think the Amir Blumenfeld Foundation For Not Giving A Shit is a meaningful project?
amir: It's..an album. And it's a film.
jake: No, it's not. Do you really expect people to donate?
amir: When you ask like that, definitely, okay? Besides, we give little bonuses to incentivize donations.
jake: I do see that--five dollars and you get a pin that says I'm Cheap James, bitch.
amir: If you're not cracking up right now, you've never seen the Chapel Show, okay? Like, that's it.
jake: Yeah, I haven't. Ten dollars gets you a t-shirt which says I donated ten dollars to a fake charity and all I got was this lousy dick.
amir: What else, man? You got notes, alright? So just say it. Don't do the like stop and go, herky-jerky thing--
jake: Sure, twenty dollars you get to punch somebody in the chest.
amir: That's trying to up-sell them, okay? To try to get them to donate fifty dollars.
jake: Which if they do, you get to punch them in the back of the head.
amir: Which hurts a lot less than punching them in the chest, watch--
jake: No!
amir: Sorry. Queen.
jake: What?
amir: Nothing.
jake: Excuse me?
amir: I didn't--
jake: I heard you say something.
amir: Yeah, I didn't say anything.
jake: This says that if I donate a hundred dollars you get to personally deliver me a bitch taco. What's a bitch taco?
amir: It's a taco with double the meat, double the shell, and if ya even think twice about eating it, I get to punch ya in the back of the head 'cause guess what?--
jake: I'm being a bitch.
amir: You're being a bitch, right.
jake: Cool, you know what? It's people like you that ruin Kickstarter for real artists like me...and other people.
amir: You're a real artist?
jake: Good question. Check your email.
amir: You're looking to self-publish a book of poetry n style.
jake: Ya, a coffee table book about my two passions.  Oh!
amir: Whoa, Streeter just donated money to my Kickstarter.
streeter: Hey, no problem, buddy man. Hope it goes to something good.
amir:  A hundred dollars. Wow, okay, ey, this is for you. 
streeter: Ohhh! Look at this, man. Whoa, look at all that meat!
amir: Yeahh.
streeter: Oh man, I'm gonna think twice about eatin' this thing.
jake: Streeter! No!
 Streeter: Ohhh! Purple nurple! 
murph: Nurple purple! Yeah!
intro:
jake: Hey, you're watching J--
amir: Hey, guess what you're watching Jake and Ami--
jake: We agreed I was gonna go!
amir: Oh, yeyeyeah.
jake: Woo!
amir: Holy shit you're wearing earrings.
jake: Holy shit you're a loser!
amir: Why did you do that?
jake: You not liking it validates it as a good idea!
amir: I didn't say I didn't like it. I just said why are you doing that.
jake: Two studs for the price of gun! BING!  OW! F- Dammit, why would I flick it?!
amir: What happened?
jake: They're still tender as the night and twice as gay-- NOT gay, not gay,, get with it, Hurwitz. I'm like, repeating that shit the dude yelled at me on the bus this morning.
amir: Someone yelled at you on the bus this morning?
jake: Yelled at me, then like boxed my ears. Pretty much got a standing-O, forcing me off the bus. I was gonna walk home, but I was like fuck it, I'm afraid to be alone.
amir: You know they're actually kinda fly.
jake: If you think they're fly now, come meet me at the club in six weeks.
amir: Six weeks?
jake: Six weeks, that's when I get to upgrade the earrings. I'mma gauge this one out.. to five sixteenths, and on this one's gonna be a giant hoop all the way down to my fucking shoulder blade.
amir: Hold on a second, I'm trying to write down how to be cool, but you're talking too fast!
jake: Write this down, baby! Spiderweb tat on my elbow, spiderweb tat on my elbow, spider tat on my abdomen, bicep tat of my astro sign, Leo DiCaprio--
amir: Heh!
jake: --and guess what I'm doing with my lips? ......eatin a pussy.
amir: Eena.. pussy?
jake:  Eating a pussy!
amir: That's a lot of changes, man.
jake: Not even including facial hair.
amir: Facial hair?
jake: A goatee on top of my thoat-ee makes the girls say ay, papi! Aheh! I made out with my cousin! At a club!
amir: Your cousin?
jake: Crimson.
amir: But you kissed your cousin though.
jake: The takeaway here is that I got into Crimson, on a Tuesday, the fourth hardest night to get into Crimson, not including the weekend.
amir: So the easiest night to get in, not including Monday--
jake: Monday, yeah, but listen I've been rejected on a Monday. Alright you ever give a bouncer a hundred dollar bill up just to see him tear it up right in front of your crying eyes?
amir: Being cool sounds hard, maybe I'm just not cut out for it.
jake: Trust fam, you ain't. Ok not a lot of people can handle the blinding pain, the crippling insecurity, the constant desire just to- you know what, fuck it! It's not worth it! It's not worth it! Help me get this off! 
amir: I thought they were cool!
jake: They are, ok! I'm just not ready for it!
murph: Aww, man!
jake: What?
pat: We heard you got your ears pierced, so we came over to make fun of you.
jake: Too late, bitches! Unless you guys think it's cool...
pat: We don't.
jake: Which is exactly why I didn't do it! Wow, that was hard!
amir: Ok, what do you guys know about being cool, I bet you've never even kissed your cousin at Crimson, huh? Tell 'em Jake!
pat: You kissed your cousin at a club?--
jake: On a Tuesday! On a Tuesday!

amir:  Pros: It's cute.  I can pee in it.
jake: We thought you were dead.
amir:  This one's pretty playful, partner, but I'm worried it's too masculine.

jake: I said we'll talk about it after work.
amir: After work. Afterwhen is after work? That doesn't mean anything, okay; if Iif I left it up to you, you'll keep pushing it and pushing it and pushing, and we'll never talk about if we're okay or not.
jake: What do you mean, When is after work? It's 6 PM! 6 PM! That's after work; there's no mystery here, okay? And don't accuse me of pushing it and pushing it and pushing it, 'cause this is the first time you've brought it up.
amir: Humor me. Okay, talk to me now, huh? Talk to me now. We can talk after work; doesn't mean we can't talk now!

jake: I am talking to you.
amir: How good are we, huh? You think we're good? How good are we? Put your money where your mouth is. Tell me how good we are.
jake: I didn't say we were good. A minute ago, you asked me if we were okay, I said we were fine, and now you're demanding to know how good we are.
amir:  Wanna know what I think?
jake: No.
amir: I think we're awful.
jake: Me too.
amir: Just kidding. I think we're great; what do you mean, Me too? What was that? I said, Just kidding, but before I did that, you said, Me too, when I said we were awful.
jake: Okay, I was kidding too.
amir:  You were kidding too.
jake: Yeah...
amir:  Time to seal the deal! 
jake: Hey... I wasn't kidding. Oh... 
amir: Y'know, I wasn't even sure that we were good, but you reassured me every step of the way!
jake: Okay...
amir: And if you would've told me two minutes ago that we'd end that conversation in a hug, especially one like this that we both like equally, no way in hell, bruh; I would've called you a coward and a fool.
jake: A little too tight, right now, okay?
amir: Yeah, and I know we would never let go unless we felt that this hug came to a natural end
amir: Ow! You accidentally hurt my neck.

amir: Really? Why?
jake: I just want to avoid death.
amir: Okay, I'd rather get eaten by a giant baby! Cuz' I'd love to see what a giant baby looks like. I think he looks like you! 
jake:  Stop it!
amir: Would you rather share your studio apartment with a horder or a whore?
jake: ...A whore.
amir: What? Okay why, why? 
jake: Relax man... stop trying to be like overly bubbly.
amir: I would chose a whore because; Horders, it's too much. It's like, I get it with the sinks and the dishes that's fine I'm a cool room-mate. But with the boxes and the envelopes it's starting to be like 'I don't wanna live in a post office.'  What did you, what did you say? A whore?
jake: Don't touch me, man..!
amir: Would you rather make an obscene phonecall to your mother once a week or get a text message every time your father is feeling horny?
jake: Text message.
amir: Why is that? Okay why is that?
jake: It's because I can ignore it.
amir: Ooh, the phonecall you have to actively do, okay. I feel like all your answers sort of follow this logical path and I think I'm on board with you.  I would rather... 
jake: Stop talking like you're on a radio show!
amir: Would you rather blow up a cow with dynamite from a distance or wring a chicken's neck with your bare hands?
jake: Cow.
amir: Why is that?
jake: Because I'd be far away, disconnected...
amir: Yeahyeah... a little bit more removed - I'd rather blow up a cow from the distance because I have already wrung a chicken's neck.
jake: Yes, you have...
amir: I've done it to a chicken, a rooster...
jake: You've had a couple of failed attempts of trying to blow up a cow... from a distance..
amir: Yeah and uh.. the dynamite was not strong enough so.. if given the opportunity I would like to blow up a cow from a distance.
jake: Yep.
amir: Would you rather stand up when everybody sitting down or sit down when everybody is standing up? Think about that. What would you rather do? You're in a , okay you're in a board room, right? Everybody's sitting. You gotta stand. You're in a funeral. Everybody standing you gotta sit. Which one would you rather do?
jake: Stand.
amir: Hah! Stand when everyone's sitting? Why is that? 
jake: I have no idea..
amir: Yeah I'd rather sit when everyone' s standing because you know what, at the very least I'm comfortable. I'm the one who's getting comfortable -  Oh, You're playing the game right now, you're standing when I'm sitting! You know what? Let's play along - I'll sit and you stand. He's gonna stand out of the room for a minute. And I'm gonna sit. He'll be back.
amir :   One gas please!
jake : Cool. I'll pump the gas then.
amir : Hey, one second!  One gas please.. To go or to stay?
jake : Look, I appreciate the effort but you clearly lied when you said you knew how to pump gas.
amir : I wanted you to think I was cool.
jake : I didn't, I thought you were normal. When you said you could pump gas I thought you were normal person but now I think you're a weirdo cause you lied about it.
amir: Hey, sorry I'm not a  genius.
jake : Be sorry that you can't pump gas! Be sorry for lying about it. Come on, we have to get this FIAT tour at contest winner.
amir : Here's a riddle, how many dillweeds does it take to pump a tank?
jake : I don't know.
amir : Two.
jake : Nope, I'm not a dillweed. You are! It takes one normal person, me, to pump gas.
amir :  Oh that's one for the scrapbook hahaha. Two helpless bozos at the gas station.
jake : No.
amir : Alright, I'm gonna get snacks. What kind of jerky do you want?
jake : No kind. Just, please use the bathroom!
amir : I'm good, thank you.
jake : Okay you say that. We could've been making a great time, okay this car has good gas mileage, moved that to pullover eleventh time so you could pee.
amir : I'm fine, relax...
jake : I'll relax if you go to the bathroom.
jake : Okay, try, come on...
amir : 
jake : You really think that given your bladder in the amount of time we've spent pulled over so you can pee today, that water, is the best  idea?
amir : That got us dehydrated, man.
jake : Okay, okay. 
amir : Pull over please, I got a whizz.

jake: You're screaming now.
amir: I am,  now I'm screaming. I'm screaming now because I'm upset! That doesn't mean that I'm screaming. Yeah, I'm only trying to scream because you're getting me pissed!

amir:  Oldest trick in the book.
amir:  Ya take one down and pass it around.
jake: My grandfather needs that oxygen tank to survive. You went up to him during dessert and said hey Scuba Steve let me take that tank for a test swim. You ripped all the tubes out of his nose, stuck them up your butt, and farted. How do you live with yourself?
amir: Think I'm gonna take a cat-nap.
jake: Fine.
amir:  Meow!
jake: Wow, mean text from your dad.
amir:  I know, right?
jake: Sorry to miss you at Thanksgiving, not.
amir: It's how he jokes, look at this.
jake: It's a picture of him burning your childhood room.
amir: Yeah, I know.
jake: That's mean.
amir: He's a meanie.  You're mean!
amir:  Plane talk: A one-act 69 to be voluntarily performed by two 69s. Haha, I made that one up.
jake: I know.
amir: I once failed a driving test, a blood test, and a personality test at the same frickin time.
jake: How do you fail a personality test? They just tell you what kind of personality you have.
amir: I failed for eating a fat cock-meat sandwich right during the session.
jake: Okay, got it.
amir: Also, I stabbed the therapist in the eye with a tack! And I'd do the same to you!
jake: Whoa!
jake: Oh, boy.
amir: What?
jake: Right here you ask your dad for his address and he just straight-up says no.
amir: Yeah, pfft.
jake: You said please and he doesn't respond for four full days. He finally says 554 go fuck yourself lane, Topeka Kansas in the good ole U.S of gay. He attached a picture of your entire family, without you, eating a turkey dinner.
amir: That's funny.
jake: You know what, man? I'm happy you came back with me for Thanksgiving.
amir: Me too.

amir: Hey, you're watching Jake and Ami-- urp.
jake: You just threw up!
amir: I hiccuped food.
paul: So, there's something really important we need to talk about now. There is... a disgusting smell coming from that side of the office, and we're starting to get bugs; we're starting to get rats...
paul: ...the facility says they're gonna start charging us extra... I know a lot of people eat over there. We've got all kinds of people eating food over there, and it's-- it's really, really foul, and...
paul: ...clearly, something's gotta be done about this. So... I-- you know, I just want to make sure... everybody's using good hygiene;
paul: Is everybody showering every day? Is everybody brushing their teeth? Is everybody... occasionally wearing deodorant, maybe?
paul:I mean, I think that would probably be a good idea...
paul: ...um, so it's really not clear to me why we can't act like adults, because... this is a professional place of business, we have a lot of visitors who come in...
paul: ...and, a lot of them are repelled--
paul: Uh, Jake. Could you put that phone away, please? Thank you.
paul: We actually had... an ad sales client in here last week...
paul: ...who was saying that they would love to spend four million dollars with us, but they couldn't, because... they were actually vomiting in the bathroom because the smell was so bad.
amir: Jake's a bitch.
murph: Ha!
murph:  He's a bitch.
paul: So, we're really trying to figure out... how we can make this better...
...because... we can't continue to do this. It's-- it's a professional place of business, the whole side of the office is just-- just horrendous...
PAUL ...this... horrible, horrible stench that's coming from over there, and, so... y'know-- I don't know if somebody's over there... going to the bathroom, and... not taking care of things properly...
paul: ...or... if there's... some other problem that we need to address, but, clearly this is something that can't continue--
paul: Jake. I'm not going to ask you again.
paul: Thank you. ...So as I was saying...
paul: ...um, I want whoever it is to, kind of, look himself or herself in the eye, make sure that... you're really thinking about your co-workers.
paul: Because...It's very selfish. It's very unfair, to... create this kind of work environment.
paul: I mean, the smell is so bad, it's-- it's just... unconsciona--
paul: Jake... leave.
jake: I wasn't texting...
amir: Get out, bitch.
paul: Oh, and Jake?
jake: Yeah.
paul: Thanks.
jake: For what?
paul: Bein' a bitch. Jake's a bitch!
all: Jake's a bitch! Jake's a bitch! Jake's a bitch! Jake's a bitch! Jake's a bitch! Jake's a bitch! Jake's a bitch! Jake's a bitch!

jake: Hey, dude, your 48 frantic texts said you were getting robbed.
amir: Hey wanna see something amazing?
jake: I came here because I thought you were in danger.
amir: Ahhh! Danger of missing that cupcake! 
jake: You swore on your father's life that you just witnessed a double murder. You were hiding in a garbage can because you saw two Puerto Rican deli workers get hacked to bits? Your voice mail ended with you saying I think they see me and then six minutes of screaming.
amir: How'd you like to be famous on YouTube?
jake: I wouldn't.
amir: Bull spit. Hey, that's my friend Basilio, okay? He's a professional parkour-doer-guy-thing.
jake: Doesn't sound like the correct name for that, right?
amir: Ahhhhh! 
jake: Okay, seriously, don't touch me! Alright? Why did you invite me here?
amir: Hey, you think that's good?
jake: I guess.
amir: Read it and weep!
jake: Read what?
amir:  Hold that.  Oh ganked that! False start, unless, did I stick it? I didn't get a good vantage point of it.
jake: Did you feel like you ran up the wall and did a back flip?
amir: I don't know, maybe. It just... Basilio says that you lose yourself in the zone, right? You get into like this zone and you just sort of can't really tell what's going on anymore, so maybe I stuck it and I just wasn't aware.
jake: He hits a zone, you hit the wall.
amir: No, I think I did it. I think I stuck the landing too, which is the hardest part, right B?
jake: Your first reaction was to say Ah, ganked that. Do you think that was a good thing?
amir: It's a great thing in parkour, it's a great thing to say that.
basilio: It's not.
amir: What do you know, man, okay? You don't know jack. It is!
jake: He's the professional, and he says it's not.
amir: Yeah, well he's a little bitch that knows less about parkour than you do! 
jake: Okay, don't do that. He's obviously being nice and trying to teach you.
basilio: I wasn't teaching him anything; he's been following me around with his video camera for three hours!
amir: Okay, freestyle walking is all about self expression!
jake: Wow! Oh my God, your arm is dislocated bad.
amir: Small price to pay for landing it square. Help me up!

jake: Yes I did, I just said no really quickly.
amir: Will you just give my album a listen and let me know what you think?
jake: How is that different than checking it out, which I just said no to?
amir: I, yeah, it's just that I spent like a bad amount of money recording this album and I really wanna know what your opinion is because I respect it... Not!
jake: Okay, so I'm not gonna check out the album.
amir:  Nononononono what? Oh my God, I was kidding, okay? It's like a 'Not' joke, and you're crying about it! How is that-
jake: -You're crying.
amir: Please just let me know what you think, okay? Just give it a listen and tweet about it, then maybe, like, Facebook about it, blog about it, Tumble about it.
jake: Okay, one: you're still crying, two: it sounds like you want me to promote the album.
amir: That's the least you can do, okay, after I spent, like, a bad amount of money recording it.
jake: Stop saying that! And it's not the least I can do; the least I can do is ignore you, which I plan on doing.
amir: Okay, ignore me, huh? Ignore  this!
jake: Oh, no...
amir: Right?
jake: Okay, is this the album?
amir: This is shit! Oh my God, if they botched the entire thing I'm gonna be pissed.
jake: Sounds like you should be pissed.
amir: No, this is just what track number one sounds like. I'm just... If the rest of it sounds like this I'm gonna be pissed because I spent, like,
jake and amir: a bad amount of money.
jake: I know.
amir: I spent a bad amount of money on it.
jake: What's a bad amount of money?
amir: It's like the worst amount.
amir:  Yo, alright, here we go, here we go, here we go, yo! Oh, okay. Turn my mic up, actually. Can you turn my mic up? I spent, like, a bad amount of money for this recording session, and my mic isn't even up!
jake: So this is the album.
amir:  Good question. It's called Chillin' in the Streets: the Night Diary of Amir Valerie Blumenfeld, a Jake Hurwitz Production.
jake: Awesome. Take my name off the title.
amir: Oh, now you give a shit! For two minutes it's just radio silence, and all of a sudden I give you some credit - one iota, not too much, just enough - and you come out of the wood works. Well guess what?
jake: What?
amir: I don't know, man. I don't know what I'm gonna say-

jake: What are you talk--
amir: Nobody talks like that! Okay, now we have to clean up, too? How is this fair?
jake: Because you dumped soup everywhere.
amir: Oh my god. Mr. Comeback's got an answer to all my quick little jokes, don't you?
jake: Fine, you go home. I'll clean.
amir: Nononono. Okay?  I wanna hang out. I just don't wanna be helpful at all. Jesus. Tis the season, right?
amir: You're watching Jake and Amirand now you're not.
jake: They still are.
amir: Fudge.
amir: Oh my... Oh my god! No! No! It was perfect!
jake: What?
amir: You gotta be kidding me with this! It was perfect! Unhh!
jake: What are you talking about?
amir: Facebook just jumped the shark. Okay, they had a perfect game going and they overdid it! Okay, trust me, I follow a lot of design Tumblrs, so I know when I see things that are overdone, and they overdid it.
jake: What's wrong with it?
amir: It's different. Which means it's bad. Which means I'm pissed. Okay, the big three.
jake: Those all sound like one thing.
amir: No, I've kept quiet till now, but I'm gonna make a Facebook group about it.
jake: You didn't keep quiet at all! You found out about it 10 seconds ago and you were yelling about it ever since. And looking at your Facebook profile, it looks like, wow, yeah, you've protested every single Facebook redesign!
amir: I deleted those groups!
jake: First of all, you didn't. Second of all, that doesn't change my point. Look at this first group, okay? Four years ago: Ten thousand strong against the Facebook newsfeed
amir: Newsfeed, yeah.
jake: Facebook was flawless and now it's garbage. They had a perfect game going.
amir: It was garbage. Yeah, they jumped the shark.
jake: Fine. Six months later you wrote, Holy carp, why change perfection? Facebook is without flaw, but new design change makes it official: they just jumped the shark. A hundred thousand strong against this Obamanation.
amir: Yeah, that group was partly political.
jake: Right.
amir: And guess what? It filled up.
jake: No it didn't. No membersyou're not even a member! Jesus Christ! Next one: Delete the Facebook Graffiti Wall. It's a joke and a fool. Two weeks later: One million strong to bring back Graffiti Wall. I know I abused it, but I miss it.
amir: Straight up, they jumped the carp, when they lost the Graffiti Wall. Like...
jake: Lemme ask you a question: do you notice a pattern?
amir:  Yeah, Facebook jumps the frickin' shark, okay? Every time they have a perfect game going and they fricking sell out! They jump the carp!
jake: Oh my god, your voice is painful! Look, here's another thing man: every single week you try to start a national Deactivate Facebook Day. Like, here's one that says Zark Fuckerberg is gonna start charging for Facebook. Please read now and delete your account.
amir: He started. He started charging, seven bucks a pop.
jake: No he didn't!
amir: He didn't, because enough people joined the group!
jake: You just lied, then, cause you said he did start charging.
amir: Oh my god, the facts are in on Twitter: Facebook was perfect but they just made it Myspace! NO!
jake: You know you said that two years ago: Ten million strong against the new Facebook, cause they just made it Myspace.
amir:  Yeah, cause it sucked!
jake: Oh my god, stop crying! You just said it was perfect. The same version you hated two years ago, you just called it perfect.
amir: Garbage becomes perfect over time as you get used to the garbage and forget what made it so bad. Like, you don't get the Internet and commenting in general, so it's not even worth saying
jake: By the way, have you been to Myspace recently? It's just a music video website. There's no profiles or anything.
amir: Yeah, you know why?
jake: Cause they jumped the shark
amir: Cause they jumped the carthe, yeahthe shark, exactly right.

Spare me your change.
jake: You're watching Jake and Amir...
amir: Are you talkin' to me?
jake: Bad impression.
amir: It was fine.
amir: How was your break?
jake: It was really nice actually...
amir: Yeah, are you just sayin' that to make me jealous?  Cause it's working.
jake: I'm just saying it was nice to see my family, it was fun to hang out with my friends from high school...
amir: Yeah, I wasn't home for but two minutes before the old man offers me a grilled jizz sandwich.  Curious, I say yes, and he chucks a cast iron skillet at the back of my face.
jake: The back of your face?
amir: The back of my fricken' face!  Yeah, hit me square and crack goes my weasel.
jake: Hey! Don't ruin my day with this sad sad story...uncross the eyes, there it is.
amir: So I say nope not this year, not again, I'm better than this, and I book it like a librarian as my dad threatens to move.  Only problem is, Uh oh, mommy's lying supine underneath my back tires threatening to sue me if I run over her head like a fricken' coconut.
jake: Jesus Christ...
amir: My Hanukkah wish, didn't come true cause my old man is just pushin' the hood of the car beggin' to the only god he knows to run the bitch over and I'm ridin' shotgun with my hand on the E-brake while the old maid is in the back fricken' planking underneath my back tires, kissing the pavement, begging me to fucking run her over too.  I'm crying like a coward up there right, screaming It's a set-up, it's a set-up!
jake: Why did you even go home?!
amir: I was asking myself the same question when my dad popped a squat on the windshield of my rented Kia Sorento and tried to drop a deuce.
jake: Tried?
amir: Yeah! Tried.  Turns out he didn't have to go and the only thing he could muster was a little bit of pee and a shart roughly the size of a dead tadpole.  Looked like a mud-covered slug and stank like a pug.  So I flip on the old windshield wipers, throw the Sorento into drive and crash through my parents garage.  Flip a U-bang and I start humming to myself ?Silent Night?.  Only problem is I'm sad as hell.
jake: Yeah, I would be too.
amir: But I figure hey, 'tis the season who doesn't love a second chance so I swing by the mall and buy my dad a two thousand dollar watch.  Yeah, a gold roly-poly for that oldy-trolly.
jake: Oh no...
amir: Oh no is...wrong!  Yeah, turns out gold isn't his color because when I get home the entire house is gutted, empty, and there's a note on what's left of the door that says here died a happy family, RIP, thanks to you, Amir.  Can you believe that?  Callin' me out like that?  Rawdoggin' me in front of my girl.
jake: So oh no was right, by the way, and, what girl?
amir: Oh that's another thing.  I brought home a Thai whore just to show my dad that I had a mate in life.
jake: Why do you want his affection?  It sounds like he's a terrible person.
amir: He means well.
jake: No, he doesn't.  How could he possibly mean well?
amir: How's this for a happy ending?  New Years Eve Eve, December 39th.
jake: Wrong.
amir: I get a call from a jail in Fresno saying that they locked my old man up and threw away the key.  I'm alone, not doing anything anyway so I toss on a wig and hoof it down to the 'No to bail his ass out.  He pretends he doesn't even recognize me, his only daughter!
jake: You haven't been right about any of the things you've said, well, ever.
amir: I spend another 15K trying to bail him out of that Alabam Slamma' and he tells the bailiff he'd rather rot in hell than owe that son of a bitch coward, me, a fricken' dime.  Wanna know the icing on the cake?
jake: Not really.
amir: Me and my dad made up and he's coming to live with me in NYC, the big crapple.
jake: That sounds like the worst idea ever.
amir: I thought so too, but he promised to make me a grilled jizz on day one.
jake: Isn't that just when he knocks you out with a...
amir: Cast iron skillet, yeah, right to the back of my fricken' face.  But at least I have a dad.
jake: I have a dad.
amir: I'm talking about Pat.
pat: You monster!
INTRO
jake: Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir.
amir: That's it, huh. No "Hi"?
jake: I said "Hey..."
amir: You said "hey" not "hi!"
jake: Are you upset that I didn't buy any cookies?
amir: Whatever, right? Whatever. Isn't that what you said?
jake: Because I'm upset that you showed up to work four hours late and you're wearing a skirt and you're trying to act like it's normal.
amir: I'm a Brownie, okay, you can either deal with it or not.
jake: I guess not.
amir: Deal with it.
jake: So I don't have that second option.
amir: Options are for closers, alright. I gotta move a hundred and fifty boxes of Thin Mints and it tastes like chocolate-covered toothpaste, but a Brownie's gotta do what a Brownie's gotta do. And guess what? This Brownie? She's gotta do.
jake: Nice.
amir: Do you mean that?
jake: No.
amir: Thank you.
jake: I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say that you're definitely not a Brownie, because I think if you tried to sign up they would arrest you for being a pedophile.
amir: Read the sash.
jake: You're not wearing a sash.
amir: I have more patches than a frickin' rodeo, man.
jake: Do they have patches there?
amir: I don't know, probably!
jake: Right, there's your badge for not giving a shit.
jake: Doesn't sound official.
amir: I officially don't care.
jake: That pin says "Most Bitchly!"
amir: Yeah! Yeah, it does, okay? But it's a reminder for me to not be such a bitchly! I'm a little ashamed about it but I keep it on!
jake: Listen to your voice.
amir: What?
jake: Don't let it get to that octave.
amir: No, I'm keeping it-
jake:  Don't let it get up here!
amir: To me, I'm like, always here, but every once in a while you just say "Oh, stop with that voice."
jake: You get really excited and start talking really fast like-
amir:  No that's not even-
jake: Yeah, yeah yeah.
amir: Okay, yeah.
jake: You just did it.
amir: I'm starting to hear it a little bit.
jake: What's the game plan here? Sell the cookies, raise money for like-
amir: Here's a tip. Every five year old in my chapter? Yeah. Their dads are  dwwiltfs.
jake: ...What?
amir: Dads whose wife I'd like to fuck.
jake:  You're a bad guy.
amir:  Why so serious?
amir: Dammit. Shit. Uhh, yeah. I went for it, didn't get it. That's... that's gonna happen. Dane Cook even tells jokes that sometimes don't get laughs. That doesn't mean shit. That feeling never gets old...
amir: Don't take a picture. Don't tweet it. This lipstick was expensive as shit, too. It wasn't... yeah. This feeling sucks. It was like a total, total gut-check. Maybe it's like the beret thing. It takes... It's too far away from The Joker that... girl scout outfit. What?
jake: I didn't say anything.
amir: Maybe you didn't hear. I'm gonna give it one more shot. 3, 2, 1... WHY SO SE-
jake: I heard it!
amir: Okay!
intro:
jake: Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir.
amir: Alright, cut.
jake: AAHH, he cut me! He cut me!
amir: Hi.
jake: Hey.
amir: Create your own reality; don't wait for happiness. You know?
jake: Fortune cookie, nice.
amir: Amir cookie, nice.
jake: Don't yell!
amir: It's a word of wisdom I came up with, and you're giving me jack shit for credit.
jake: You sure it wasn't inside that fortune cookie that you just opened? There's crumbs all over you.
amir: This is sand, okay? I was eating a sand-based nut, a sandnut, so there's cookie sand all over me if that's what you're bitching about.
jake: How is it cookie sand if it was a sandnut? Also, neither of those things exist. Cookie sand and sandnut? You made them both up.
amir: Create your own reality and don't wait for happiness, okay? It is only by creating that that that that that that that joy that you can be in the zone.
jake: Sounds like you're trying to remember what the fortune cookie said, now you're not quite getting it.
amir: No, I said create... What I came up with was Create your own reality, and don't wait for happiness. It is by creating that that that that that that that joy that you can be in the zone.
jake: First part makes sense, the second part does not sound smart.
amir: How's this for not sounding smart: I once ate a gay beetle.
jake: How'd you know it was gay?
amir: It was humping another beetle.
jake: Was it another male beetle?
amir: Does it matter?
jake: Why'd you eat it?
amir: Doesn't matter.
jake: Fine. Whatever. Cause create your own reality, don't wait for happiness, right?
amir: Hahaha, you're talking out of your ass.
jake: Ugh, new laugh?
amir: Yeah.
jake: It's bad.
amir: It's good.
jake: Lemme see the fortune.
jake: It is only in creating that that that joy that you can be in the zone.
amir: Told you!
jake: Where did you get these?
amir: A homeless asian dwarf lady gave me like twenty of these on the way to work today.
jake: Lemme have one.
jake: OW, OW!
amir: What is it?!
jake: It's sharp and hot!
amir: I told you! It's a sand nut, you're not supposed to eat it, you're supposed to just read the fortune!
jake: Where's the for- AGH there's a beetle in here!
amir: Is it gay?!

jake: Hey, nine hours late today.
amir: Mondays...
jake: Thursday, and why is your shirt soaking wet?
amir: Laundry day! Ooh, that was hard.
jake: Was hard... Never act like I'm incorrect.
amir: Sorry, just that Tuesdays are my laundry day.
jake: It's Thursday, and you just thought it was Monday.
amir: Yeah, last Saturday I thought it was Sunday, turns out it was Thursday, how's that for a Tuesday? Talk about the worst Monday ever, Wednesday.
jake: Start making sense, now.
amir: I woke up on the right side of the bed this morning in the first time in a calender year. Spotted a pile of laundry, my laundry and dirty clothes and said haahahaa... Not today!
jake: You said: haahahaa... Not today!?
amir: That's exactly right. Then I washed it, I dried it, I folded it, and to top that o-
jake:  I'm gonna stop you right there because you didn't dry it.
amir: I didn't fold it either, but you're not busting my chops about that are you? You know what your problem is? You bust my chops, and I love you for it.
jake: I'm not gonna talk to you for the rest of the day I think...
amir: I'm air-drying okay? Sorry.

amir: I'm numb though too, numb and cold. So numb that I don't even feel how cold I am.
jake: Yeah, you're numb because you're cold.
amir: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's true exactly right okay. It's the first time you've ever made a point so legit that I didn't want to punch you in the tits about it.
jake: Unclench your fist. What are you doing? Chill out, okay? You want to now ha?
amir:  Changed my mind.
jake: Why are you being so agressive right now?
amir: Maybe becacuse you haven't even complimented me once about washing my clothes.
jake: You did a bad job.
amir: I did a good job of washing it, of washing it I said.
jake:  Ooh, no you didn't.
amir: It's vinegar.
jake: It's vinegar.
amir: It's vinegar.
jake: Why vinegar?
amir: Why are you not complimenting me, okay. Just because it's vinegar it doesn't mean you're not gonna compliment me.
jake: It's exactly what it means, yes.
amir:  Here come the waterworks...
jake: Are you waiting for me to cry, or-
amir: Yeah I'm waiting for you.
jake: You're crying.
amir: You're the one who's about to.
jake: You're crying.
amir: It's both of us, look at us crying up here like a bunch of ninnies.  Everyone turn back, don't look at us two dudes, two grown men just sharing a beef.
jake: What are you...What's a beef?
amir: We're beefing right now.

intro:
amir: You're watching Jake and Amir, and now you're not.
jake: They still are.
amir: Fuuudge.
amir: makes strange face, mumbles quietly, blows on Jakes face, clinks teacup with saucer trying to wake Jake up
amir:  Our Los Angeles itinerary is as follows:
jake: What time is it?
amir:  6 a.m, day after Christmas, I put mumbles
jake: Why did you...
amir:  She's a brick and I'm drowning slowly!
jake: Stop singing...
amir:  Off the brick and...
jake: Stop singing that song!
amir: It's about a fun vacation!
jake: It's not about a fun vacation, it's about a... Why did you get me up this early?
amir: When I tell you the reason? Yeah you're gonna feel like a goose. Okay, so I urge you to back down now.
jake: Just tell me.
amir: I made you tea. It's too late, I said it, you're a jerk.
jake: No, I don't think that was nice, it wasn't nice of you to make tea this early and then wake me up.
amir:  I didn't want it to get cold!
jake: Bad logic. Bad logic, right? Make the tea later.
amir: I knew you were gonna say that.
jake: If you knew I was gonna say that then why did you do it?
amir: Because I didn't know until you said it, and then right as you said it I knew!
jake: Okay then you didn't know! So don't...
amir:  Tit punch!
jake: Dude, why did you do that?
amir: Ya get one tit punch!
jake: That was two.
amir: A bonus tit punch for counting the tit punches... Like a tit.
jake: Just tell me what the itinerary is...
amir:  6 a.m: Wake up, receive a tit punch.
jake: Great. Done. Next.
amir: 6:15: Triple S, shower, shave, shit.
jake: Bad order.
amir: At the same time.
jake: Jesus Christ.
amir: 7:30: Tour the canyon, there's a beautiful spot in the middle where you can see the Colorado river for miles.  8 a.m: Rent donkeys, hire a local jackass, pun intended, to help us navigate...
jake: Okay stop it, do you think we're at the Grand Canyon?
amir:  No.
jake:  A lot of this stuff is canyon related.
amir:  Name twelve. And make sure that they're about the Grand Canyon specifically, not just about any canyon.
jake: Great. Easy. 9 a.m: Get a view of the canyon, she is grand, and she is canyon.
amir: I am a shame.
jake: 10 a.m: Get matching Grand Canyon tattoos. They should read This friendship is as grand as the canyon. Arizona.
amir: No.
jake: Yeah. 11 a.m. just says Arizona eight times in a row.
amir: This is a public shaming of me.
jake: No it's... We're in a... No it's not.
amir: This is so messed up. I made like an amazing jackass-donkey pun earlier, and we're just glossing over it.
jake: The stuff that's not canyon related is just straight up mean.
amir:  It's poking fun at society! Yeah okay, who are we if we can't laugh at ourselves?
jake:  Oh my god, stop with the voice.
amir: You know not everyone has these rose colored sunglasses that you do!
jake: 1 p.m: Break all the baby food at the supermarket so the babies have no food?
amir: Occupy Baby Street.

jake: Is that related? Who- Stanley Grylls?
mountain hiker:  Who the fuck is Stanley Grylls? Who's this guy?
amir: What?
mountain hiker:  Who's this jack-a-lope you bring along?
jake: The way you s- The way you said it made it sound like you-
mountain hiker: I can help you guys outta here.
jake: Out of the net?
mountain hiker: No no no. A baby could get out of that net.
amir:  WAH!
jake: Relax. What are you even doing here?
mountain hiker: I'm happy you asked that. I am hunting the most dangerous game of all.
jake:  Cows?
mountain hiker:  Cows.
jake: Why do you think cows are dangerous?
mountain hiker: Think about it, man. Overweighted-ness, diabetes, heart failure, um...choking on stuff.
jake: You're saying they're all caused by beef?
mountain hiker:  What the fuck is beef? Who is this guy?!
amir: He's-
jake: What do you- You don't know what beef is?
amir: He's kidding.
jake: I'm not kidding.
mountain hiker: Well are you kidding?
jake: No. I'm not kidding.
mountain hiker:  Surely, he's kidding.
amir:  He's kidding.
jake:  I'm not kidding.
mountain hiker:  Thank grood-ness.
jake: Why do you think that cows are the number 1 killer in all the world? What about, car accidents?
mountain hiker: Uh, half the cars in the United States and Milwaukee are all driven by bovines.
jake: Milwaukee is in the United States and no, that's not true. Where did you get that information?
mountain hiker: Saw it in a documentary.  You should see it. It's called The Far Side by Gary Larson.
amir: Is it on Netflix?
mountain hiker: Uh, I think it's on Netflix In-staunt.
jake: Okay, not how you pronounce it. That's a cartoon.
mountain hiker: Uh, a cartoon based on facts.
jake: A cartoon based on jokes.
mountain hiker: A cartoon based on jokey facts.
jake: Just-just jokes. Just don't laugh like that. Oh God. What are you guys doing? Just making each other laugh like this? Why?  Are you flirting right now? Is this how you flirt with each other?
mountain hiker: Hold back, hold back, hold back.
jake: OW!
mountain hiker: Moo moo.
jake: No!
mountain hiker: Oh! You're not a cow.
jake: Why did you think I was a cow?
mountain hiker: Ugh, the way you were using your cow-y fingers I was almost certain of it that time.
jake: Fingers? Cows have hooves.
mountain hiker:  Cows has hooves!  You hear that, Tree? Cows has hooves.  Next thing you're going to tell me is that top hats don't have tops. 
jake: Draw a cow!
mountain hiker: I can't draw a cow. There's not enough time.
jake: It'll take you 2 seconds.
mountain hiker: Okay, stop. You could give me 2 months straight and all I have to do is draw a cow, and even then, I couldn't draw a fucking cow.
jake: That is so sad.
mountain hiker: We can talk about cows until they come home, but the fact of the matter remains your friend is missing and we must find him
jake: First of all, he's not my friend. Second of all, he's not missing. He's right-
jake: Where is he?
mountain hiker: The hunt is on. Do you have your safari hat?
jake: No.
mountain hiker: Good.  You're gonna need it.
jake: I said I didn't have one so it's not good, right?

ben: You know what, I'll do you one better. Why don't we strip down to our balls and dicks, rub against each other for warmth 'cause it's freezing out here?
jake: How is that one better? By the way, dude, it's 90 degrees.
ben: 90 degrees cold, we should get in a hot-cold bath.

guy: Then I'm not going to give it to you.
amir: Now, w-w-wait, ok, what are you gonna do, just throw it away? That's wasteful, it's gonna melt.
guy: Fine. Just take it.
amir: Yess! Oh, and keep your phone on, Ok? I'm gonna call you in about 15 minutes for a third. Oh, and by the way,  Oh, yeah!

jake: Yeah, you gotta walk on your own for a minute.
ben: Hey, are you getting tired?
jake: No, I'm not tired.

jake: Stop it, I'm not tired.
ben: Well, maybe how 'bout that dick of yours?
jake: Stop it, I'm not-
ben: Right, yeah, yeah. But you looked like you were yawning for a tiny bit.
jake: It doesn't matter. Even if I was tired I wouldn't need you to tickle me.
ben: Right, but I should do it to test the waters.
jake: No, don't test the waters.
ben:  Like, test the waters. 
jake: You just tested the waters and it didn't work out, right?
ben: Hey, Amir.
amir: Hey.

jake: Grey, is what I was going to say. Alright, the key to brushing your teeth efficiently is...
amir: I know, once a week mother!
jake: Circular motion. Okay, stop acting like you know what I'm going to say.
amir: Sorry, mother
jake: You want to get just a little bit of tooth paste on the brush like this.. Stop peeing! Stop Peeing!
amir: It says use a pee sized amount, okay. I was just comparing.
jake: It's getting on my legs!
amir: Oh, you've never felt pee before
jake: No, not on my legs.. Stop peeing! Okay, you want to start with your bottom teeth like this.
amir: Call me Bleeding Gums Murphy, cause I'm Black!
jake: Jesus, what is that?
amir: Chocolate, oil and figs!
jake: Look at you, you're just brushing your gums, how are your teeth not insanely yellow.
amir: I white strip for 10 hours a day!
jake: Seriously?  Oh my God, they're so soft
amir: Yeah!
jake: They felt like white beans
amir: Yeah!
jake: They're softer than cooked rice
amir: Yeah!
jake: Alright, you want to get the floss real nice and tight like this, and then slide it.
amir: Ahhhh, it pricked me, little bitch
jake: I'm serious man you've got to stop white stripping
amir: Yeah!
jake: You're teeth feel like velvet
amir: Yeah!
jake: Like little rectangles of flannel or something
amir: Yeah!
jake: A mouth full of packing pieces
amir: Yeah!
jake: They're loose too, I feel like I could just flick one out, no problem
amir: Oh definitely. Let me feel your teeth Hot shot, let me feel how hard they are  too hard, way too hard, you got to have a little give!
jake: No, they don't

jake: Exactly!
amir: Exactly
jake: Slide it through the tooth gently
amir: Oh crapsicles son of a bitch pricked me again
jake: You should be brushing your teeth for a full two minutes, three times a day
amir: Okay, I don't have an hour to waste on this bullshit!
jake: Why do you think it's an hour?
amir: Thirty times four
jake: Alright blood is good, it means your gums are getting healthy

jake: No, you're controlling the floss, so you're being a little bitch pricking yourself
amir: Ahh, she is a demon bitch, but she is good

INTRO
jake: You're watching Jake and Amir.
amir: Oh, you spelled "you're" wrong.
jake: Didn't spell it, just said it.
amir: Coward!
amir:  Okay, what do you think about this for a Valentine's poem?  How Many Words Would It Take by Amir Valarie Blumenfeld.
jake: You know you can change your middle name, right?
amir:   How many words would it take to accurately express what you mean to me?  How can you scientifically quantify how much lighter I become when you enter my day and how heavy I feel when you leave?  How can I describe how my smile just appears magnetically when  I see your face?    How can I possibly count my thoughts of you when I think of you so constantly?  As thoughts within thoughts, within thoughts, within thoughts make it impossible to remember where one began and the other ended.  Time folds into itself as I am already nostalgic for our future and look forward to our past.  For the rest of my life, I love you.
jake: Wow...that was...
amir: DUMB, I know!  
jake: No, it was good.  It was really, really good.
amir: I texted the first part of it to myself while I was takin' a shit.
jake: Dude, it was incredible.
amir: And the second part, I was mid-wipe so I just said "fuck it, I'll leave it as a voicemail to myself".  Haha.  Are you crying?
jake:   Yeah!  I welled up a little.  Who're you giving that to?
amir: I don't know, I just freestyled it off the top of my dick, probably nobody; I'm gonna can it.  
jake: Hey, hey, hey!  N-n-n-no, no Man!
amir: What?  You already have a card.
jake: No, Dude, I lost it!  It was better than yours and now it's gone!
amir:  What about that?
jake: It's a placeholder.  It's a suckier version of the card I wrote; a dummy version.
amir: Read it.
jake: I'll read it to you and if you think it's shwing-worthy then it might just be my actual card.
amir: Um...sh
jake:     You are blazing to me.  You are so blazing.  No, you're better than blazing; you're blazin'.  No 'g', just an apostrophe, you don't need a 'g', 'cause I'm your G.  So we drop the 'g'.    And tonight, you gonna drop your g-string.  Let me see that crack, Girl.  I bet it ain't whack, Girl.  Love, your not-so-secret-admirerer, J-Witz.    If you thought it sucked it's only because I can't read for shit.
amir: No...Man, it was...good...
jake: You say that and you mean it, but you're wrong.
amir: What?
jake: What did yours say?
amir: What does it matter what mine says?
jake: 'Cause I'm gonna amend mine!  A little bit!  Based on some of the words you said.
amir: But I wrote
jake: Just say some of it 'cause I can't remember how stupid it was!
amir: I don't
jake: That's all!
amir: I don't wanna say any of
jake: It was like, "how can I count the ways by-like how many thoughts within thoughts, within thoughts and then nostalgia for our future and past already" or something like that.  "How can I possibly
sarah: count the ways you are thinking within, thoughts ,within thoughts, I lost count.  That's the point.  I can't count worth shit because I forget how number work when you're around because you are blazin'.  Love, J-Witz.  What is this?    This is so weird.
jake:   I knew you were too dumb to appreciate it.    Fuck it, kiss me.  
sarah:  Geez, no, ah, stop, no!  
jake: Gotcha!  Haha.
outro:
sarah: Now tonight, you drop your g-string.  Let me see that crack, Girl.  I bet it's not whack, Girl?  Amir, that's so sweet.

jake: Did you hear me when I said go back to work?
amir: Yeah it's an online newsletter.
jake: I didn't ask what it was.
amir: It's sort of like about disrupting the status quo, sorta keeping the government on its toes and stuff like that.
jake: Fine. What's it called?
amir: Oo, now you care, huh?
jake: Forget it. Forget I asked
amir: It's called Poodle Tartar, okay, because he's rawdogging the non-readers.
jake: Bad. Bad title. So stupid.
amir: He only writes it on weekends that he doesn't have to spend with his children.
jake: Oh my god, I hate that he has children.
amir: Only 9, okay. But they're mostly grown up now. Actually, seven of them are the same age.
jake: How olwhat?!
amir: Huh?
jake: He hathat's septuplets!
amir: Seven different moms, ya idiot! They choreographed it.
jake: That seems less likely.
amir: You'd be surprised.
jake: I am surprised.
amir: This one's pretty messed up actually, it's about 300 pages of bomb schematics and pictures of Leron taking a dump on public libraries, which he swears to God is not illegal. And then
there's, like, a personal treatise devoted to how tipping isn't technically mandatory.
jake: That's true.
amir: What?
jake: Tipping's not mandatory. You don't have to do it. But, a lot of waiters and service persons rely on the income
amir: Holy guack, I'm never tipping again. What about gifts?
jake: What about gifts?
amir: Gifts! Yeah! You know, for birthdays, weddings, funerals, of that nature.
jake: Don't bring a gift to a funeral.
amir: Something small, something nice.
jake: No! Right, buddy? Come on. Have you been to a funeral?
amir: Yeah, I've been to hundreds.
jake: Look. Just try to unlearn whatever you just read about in Leron's ezine.
amir:  Mickey my friend! How are you? Long time caller, first time not-giving-a-shitter. You know how last week I crashed your daughter's onesie? Yeah, her one year old
birthday party at the kiddie gym. Showed up drunk as a kite and promised her the best gift money couldn't buy? Well guess what, Mickey? That ship has docked. Go outside Mickey and try to pretend it's not Thanksgiving, because your eyes are about to feast on the sickest jungle gym you've ever seen. This one's so big it's a goddamn rainforest gym! Splinter-free and polished since '93 in Holished.
jake: Stupid rhyme.
amir:  You opening the door Mickey? Yeah, check it out Mickey. You're looking at nothing, Mickey. Cause you know what, Mickey? Gifts ain't legal, Mickey!
jake: Yes they are.
amir:  The only thing I have to get you, Mickey, is a visit from my friend Jonathan Squat AKA jack shit. Yeah, you lied to me Mickey, you pressured me with fake social norms
Mickey, and for that I urge you to attend your local chocolate factory and go fudge yourself!  Unh!
jake: God that was impressive.
amir: Thank you.
jake: Do you plan that out? Like the, Go outside and pretend it's not Thanksgiving, feast your eyes on this, you plan that out?

jake: I don't want to give you  go out there wearing the same shirt. You want everyone to think we're twins? You want that to
happen! Ioh my god. I don't want thatif you want it to happen, I don't want it to happen. That's why I'm not gonna tell you.
amir: So yeah, I'll wear it Monday Wednesday Friday, you wear it on Tuesday Thursday, how's that? How's that for a plan?
jake: That'sit's a bad plan.
amir: How about I get the same shirt as you? It won't even be the same size, it'll be two different shirts, , in
the same style, same style as it! II'm really really stressed out, because I'm afraid that at the end of the day you're not gonna...
jake: I hateright, right, right, it'syour veins are popping out of your neck so bad! Breathe! Breathe in! Breathe in! Stop yelling
and breathe! For three seconds.
jake: Five, four, alright
amir: I'm afraid that you're not even gonna end up telling me what shirt!
jake: Oh my god! You... Oh... You know what, you couldn't pull this shirt off.  You won't look good in this shirt! This shirtit's
a bad shirt, but I'm a fucking attractive dude so I make it work for me. You know what I'm saying?
amir: Because I can't, likewhat I'm gonna walk into a store and go, like, Hey, can I get one that's red and plad just like Jake?
They won't know who you are! I'm gonna take a picture and send it to you, but, like, what's that gonna get done? At the end of the day?
Give me a range. Give me a range. Give me a range, okay? Give me, like, 10 stores, I'll go to each one and I'll figure out which shirt
you're wearing.
jake: Younothat's so pathetic. You're just gonna walk into?
amir: Why is that pathetic? That I wanna wear a cool shirt? You're wearing that shirt, are you pathetic?
jake: What? You're about to cry! You're about to cry! Look at your eyes. Look at your eyes.
amir:  Are you pathetic? Are you pathetic? Are you pathetAnd it's not like I wanna wear one on the same day! It's not like
I'm gonna wear it on the same day! We can alternate days!
jake: Oh you want to alternate! So that means, like, I have to call you before workI have to check in with you to see if you're
wearing my shirt!
amir: You wear it on Monday, I can wear it on Tuesday, you can wear it on Wednesday, I wear it on Thursday, you wear it on Friday, I
wear it on Saturday, you wear it Sunday, I can wear it Monday, you can wear it on Tuesday, I can wear it on Wednesday. That's how we
should
jake: I'm notthen we can just share this shirt by your logic, right? Yeah
amir: Yeah! I wanna do that! I wanna share clothes with you, but I feel like I would sort of ease into that, by getting the same
clothes as you, and then you'd realize that, why are we wasting so much money!
jake: Knowing that you wanna do that ultimately really freaks me out. StopI wanna s
amir: We should just wear the same clothes! We can wear the same clothes! Put them in the same!
jake: FINE! I got it at Forever 21! Okay? Are you happy now? Forever 21! There's a unisex section upstairs!
amir: I got the shirt. I said I wouldn't get the shirt, and I did. I did get the shirt. I called your bluff, and you lost.
pat: Woah, woah, twinsies! Did you guys plan that, or...?
amir: Yeah.

EPISODE
amir: I had a fuck dream last night.
jake : Come on.  Oh, sorry.  What are you doing?
amir: What? I brought bagels* for the whole company and you're doggin' on me for mentioning, just mentioning that I had a dream? I haven't even gotten into the lurid details yet. And they are wet.
*
jake: It was inappropriate.
amir: You bet your ass it was.  Imagine every koala ever, in a bikini.
jake: Did you buy bagels for everybody just so you can act like an asshole?
amir: Ok, fine, congratulations for this.  Guys, everyone throw up your bagels right now.  Throw them up or start paying me for them.
jake: You can't do that.
amir: Guess what? Everyone owes me two bucks now because Jake's doggin' me.  We'll call it a "Jake doggin' me fee."
jake: You showed up with bagels around your nipples.
amir: As a joke.
jake: You said "bagels on me."
amir: As a joke.
jake: And now, you're demanding money, not as a joke, right? You can't do that, it's fucked up.  It's a form of robbery.  It's extortion.  It's also pronounced bagel.
amir: What am I saying?
jake: You're saying bagel.
amir: Right, bagel.
jake: No, wrong it's-
amir: Bagel.
jake: It's-
amir: Bagel.
jake: Let me say it.  Because you said it wrong three times in a row, ok?
amir: Bagel.
jake: Let's go one syllable at a time.
amir: Ok.
jake: Say "beig"
amir: Daeg.
jake: "el" 
amir: "el" 
jake: Bagel.
amir: Baeg-el.
amir: Worse, right?
amir: Woah, three bucks! You prick in a wig! Three bucks!
jake: Relax, dude.
amir: You owe me money you skinny bitch!
murph: Eh! Cool it! That's my girlfriend, buddy.
jake: No way, how long?
murph: Fuck you!
jake: Jesus. You know, dude, she didn't even take a bagel.
amir: Bagel! You frickin' nimrod!
jake: You never had any intention at all of giving these away for free, did you?
amir : I hustle. Ok?
jake: I hate that you can put those on so quickly.
amir: I spend a penny to make two. Do you know what it's like to grow up on the street? To be hood? Or would you rather just suck off Uncle Sam and swallow what he gives ya? By the way, that was my dream last night.
jake: You have a job. You could make so much more money doing a good job here, in the office. Did you really blow Uncle Sam in your dream last night?
amir : I could clear five dollars easy street if all y'all just ponied up six dollars apiece for these Ed Bagley juniors! Ok, make my money work for me!
jake: That's not even- how much did you spend on these bagels?
amir : Roughly...
amir: Don't grab stuff out of my hand, ok? I was gonna bring it up earlier but I was gonna wait-
jake : Six hundred dollars! I think you got ripped off.
amir: Look me in my eyes and actually tell me that you think I got ripped off.
jake: I just did. I think you got ripped off.
amir: No, not buying that, you blinked.
jake: Oh, what is going on?
amir: Alright, listen up everybody. 
jake: Say it!
amir: Y'all now have giardia.  Alright, straight up it's a rare form of food poisoning that lasts three weeks; we're talking vomiting, diarrhea, jaundice, infantile jaundice!
jake : Oh!
amir: Don't worry there is a cure.
jake: What is it?
amir: Bedrest. And that information will cost you six hundred dollars, so...  And I just made a profit!
jake: Take those off!

EPISODE LINK
amir: Whoah, nice chin strap beard.
jake: Whoah, I can still get with girls. That's not the issue.
amir: Why wear something that people can only compliment sarcastically?
jake: I missed a spot, I missed one spot, so I said 'fuck it, I'll go with a chinner'
amir: A chinner?
jake: Winner Winner Chicken Chinner, yeah! Any questions?
amir: Why did you do it?
jake: Not a question.
amir: Yeah it is.
jake: Here's a science fact: Chicks dig scars. Or was Ice Cube at the 'Are We There Yet' cast  crew after-party sponsored by Voss Water not stylin'?
amir:  Do chicks dig chin strap beards?
jake: Does it matter? 'Cause I can shave it off. Also, it was a joke! I build up a defensive wall so thick you can't get through it with dynamite.  How's that for insecure?
amir:  I respect you so much but sometimes you make me really sad for you.
jake: A chin strap for this thin chap make the fat booty go clap. I made out with my nephew. At a house party.
amir: Sorry, what?
jake:  I get invited to house parties, is what I'm saying.
amir: You kissed-You have a, wait- You have a nephew?
jake: He's a little twerp.  Him and his friends beat the shit out of me and pissed on my jeans.
amir: What, because of your beard?
jake: Chin strap. No. I crashed their party and I was j-
amir: So you weren't invited?
jake: To their house party? No.
amir: You said you get invited to house parties.
jake: Not that one! I get invited to other house parties. I wasn't invited to this one. I get invited to other house parties, ok? Anyway I show up, I'm jackin' all the poon,  they come up to me and they're like 'uh uh dude, you weren't invited, and we're 16'
amir: And then you made out with him?
jake:  A little bit, yeah! And I obviously forgot to mention that I was
Robotripping.
amir: Robotripping?
jake: It's called you polish off a bottle of  Robitussin, you wash it down with two pumps of capri sun. I would eat dog shit if Bradley Cooper did it in Limitless.
murphy: Hey Jake, can I borrow your copy of Limitless?
jake: Dude, I'm shaving it.
murphy: What are you talking about?
jake: This chin strap, it's obviously a goof, I'm shaving it as we squeak.
murphy: I don't know man, I think it looks pretty cool.
jake:  So do I. It does make me look quite 'strapping'
murphy: Haha, uh, I was joking. It sucks.
jake: Dude, I was joking too.  Haha. Tell me what to think.  Honestly, because I'll pull the hair out right now if you say the word.
pat cassels:  Jesus, Jake, why are you insecure?
amir: He's not, ok, it's called Robotripping! Have you ever done it? No, probably not because you're too scared to even eat dog shit!
murphy: Are you crying?
jake: Dude, he for real! I made out with my nephew.
amir: He did. At a house party.
jake: House party. Tell them where it was, dude.
amir: He kissed him at a house party.
murphy: You're both crying so much!
jake: We're beefing.
amir: We're beefing.
jake: We're beefing.
amir: We're beefing.
jake: We beef.
intro:
amir: Hey you're watching Jake and f***ing Amir!
jake: We can't use that!
amir: Just bleep it!
amir: Alright so how does this work?
jake: It's called grinding, you giant ass! You rub your boner against women to prove to society that you're worth a shit.
amir: Have you ever done it before?
jake: Got really close once, but I got cocky, started tweeting #victory, scarred the bitch off.
amir: Heheh.
jake: Woulda' been a total loss, but I got victory trending in NYC.
amir: Wow, really?
jake: NOT the trending part!
amir: Soo, do you do this every night, or...
jake: Well not every night, usually I come here at like 4 PM. I have to get here before the bouncer because these clubs are exclusive as shit. Great question, I hide in the men's room and pretend I'm the janitor.
jake: Alright dude, practice; pretend I'm a hot girl.
amir: Alright.
jake:  Hey babe.

 gives Jake a disgusted look.)

bridget:  ...Yeah.
jake: Will you date me? Will you date me? Cuz I'll be exclusive, and you don't have to be. How's that for--
jake:  Dude! Dude don't touch me right now, I'm thirty seconds away from getting line-poon.
jake:  One drink, okay I'm begging you, one drink, and then I'll grind on you like you've never been ground before.
bridget: If you lose that fedora,--
bridget: Let me finish. If you lose that fedora, and you go home, maybe I'll forget about how badly you embarrassed yourself in front of me.
jake: Damn girl. Aight, you fly.
bridget: You're ugly to me.
jake: Ahkey! Chill!
jake:  Hey, why don't you dump your iPhone boyfriend and go out with this Man-Droid?
bridget: Oh my God that is the DUMBEST thing I have EVER HEARD.
jake: Ooh my God! Stop being mean to me!
jake: Hey everybody, check it out, I think there's a whale at this party, somebody's got a blow-hole. 
jake:  Yo you're ugly! I wouldn't fuck you with his dick! 
bridget: You look like your chin grew pubes; I wouldn't let you fuck me with anyone's dick!
jake: Ok well I wouldn't.. take his dick to fu-- You're a fuckin' ten. You're a ten, okay? Can I have your number?
bridget: No!
jake: Here's my phone, put in your number. It doesn't even have to be the real number, I'll never call it
jake: Hey dude.  Dude!
jake:  It can be fake if you want, I'll chalk it up as a W. I just wanna show my boys that I got one number tonight!
jake:  I'm a big bear, man! I got these claws, and these fangs, and I'm just battin' the bunny around!  With this, what do I do with the bunny- It's from Swingings! With Jon Favers, and Vince Vang!
jake:  Pop quiz, hotshot, do you have game?
amir: Game?
jake: It's called game. You use it to get with chicks, it's the most important thing in the world.
amir: I lost my childhood dog today!
jake: None due respect dude, FUCK your childhood dog!, ok, this is more important. You know Game of Thorns? This is Game of Thongs!
amir: Game of Thorns?
jake: Game of Thongs, I said. D-D-DO YA HAVE IT, GAME?
jake:  Uh, you go find a girl, you grind on her, like this, oh hey  WHOA! DUDE, RELAX, I DIDN'T SEE A RING, DUDE!
amir: He didn't see a ring!
jake: I didn't see a ring!
amir: Oh, I see a ring.
jake: You see a ring??
amir: Yeah, I see a ring.
jake: Auh she has a ring, dude?!
END.
outro:
amir: Here ya go! So...
bouncer: C'mon, this is a fake ID, man!
amir:  Busted, let's go home.
jake: What are you doing, you're twenty-nine, why would you use this ID?!
amir: I wanna be from Nebraska!
amir: Hey, you're watching Evan and John.
jake: Nope, they're not.
amir: Jake and Ryan?
jake: Closer.
amir: Yes!
amir: Okay, year 5 of our March Brad--er--oh! Fuck, I'm concussed. 
amir: Michican? More like Michi-can't! I'm sorry, straight to the final four with ya!
jake: It's MichiGAN, not MichiCAN, and why 'straight to the final four with ya'?
amir: Huh?
amir: Kentucky will be getting lucky... in N'awlins.
jake: Well, they're a number one seed, so it wouldn't really be getting lucky--
amir: Sorry, did I say unlucky? I meant getting lucky. 
jake: You said getting lucky.
amir: So compliment me.
amir: Can-tucky? More like  'Can't, yucky!'  Straight to the final four with ya!
jake: What is wrong with you? You have to write down a winner each round. You can't have an arrow going from round one--
amir: Straight to the final four with ya! Yeah!
amir: Need I remind you I picked every single upset last year.
jake: You only picked upsets last year. Sixteens over ones, fifteens over twos.
amir: Yeah, and how did I finish?
jake: In our work pool, you finished dead last.
amir:  How? I picked every single upset!
jake:  Every single upset.
amir: Yeah, okay. So I didn't--what did I finish in?
jake: Last!
amir: You know what, no, I wanna be funny on Youtube.
jake: Just focus on this!
amir: You're right, sorry.
amir: UCONN? More like U CON'T! Straight to the final whore--mmm--four with ya!
amir: Will you rate and subscribe?
jake: No, I won't. You know why? 'Cause your one video on there is nine-and-a-half minutes long and it's you psyching yourself up to eat a ghost pepper, which you never do. At the nine minute mark, you faint from fear. You know, you don't even have to upload that video, right?
amir: Bellmont?  That sounds like the name of a dumb dog. 'Come here Bellmont! Come here Bellmont! Ah, you dumb mutt.'  Right? Right? Right?
jake: You know, I was trying to ignore you, but since you're pressing me for an answer, no, not right. It's really stupid.
amir: Holy shit, you're negative.
amir:  'You know how we play 'Would You Rather'? Cavemen used to play 'Would You Gather'.' That is a bad tweet.
jake: That is why I almost didn't tweet it! Wow, I'm gonna delete it!  Where's my fucking phone, dude?
amir: It's in your pocket--
jake: This is my wallet!
jake: You know what, I don't even think they're gonna let you participate if you don't pay back the money you owe from the last four March Madness pools.
amir: What? What are you talking about? Suck my dick, okay, I ponied up the dough!
jake: No you didn't! Let's look back just last year. You were mathematically eliminated after the first day. You begged Johnson Hussey for your money back, when he finally gave it to you, you said, Keep the change you filthy animal. I'ma buy back in at a G. You submitted what turned out to be a perfect bracket and a thousand dollars in cash--
amir: : Thank you.
jake: Then you showed up, rolling on E to our office party for the finals. You shredded the money, tore up your bracket and pissed on Sunusi's phone. You screamed, All contracts are null and Lloyd! Then you started crying when no one realized it was an Entourage reference.
amir: I wanted people to hug it out, bitch.
jake:  Arrie, right.
amir: Yeah, Arrie Goals.
jake: All right, I think this is it. These picks--
amir: Ah, Jake, that Final Four is good, and I'ma let you finish, but these picks--
jake: Oh my God, are you seriously bringing back that Kanye thing, dude?
amir:  I'ma was gonna let you finish.
amir: You're gonna be using this one as the answer key.
jake: No, we're not, because that's last year's answer key.
amir: Yeah, well, history tends to repeat itself--
jake: None of the first-round matchups are the same.
amir: I'm a loser and a Jew.
jake: That's true, but don't... say it like that.
amir: I'ma, I'ma was gonna sit back and I'ma was gonna let you finish, you know? I'ma has manners, after all, but you interrupted me.
jake:  You interrupted me!
amir: Ah! And now I'ma feels bad, okay? I feel bad about I'ma-self!
amir: And...done!
jake: You have your final score in the championship being a tie.
amir: Yeah, well, hindsight is 20-20.
jake: Your final score is 20-20.
amir: Mon-can-a? More like Mon-can't-a!
jake:  No? It's not Mon-can-a!
amir: You best start believing in ghost stories, Miss Turner, 'cause you're in the final four!
jake: What are you--
amir: With!
jake: 
amir: Ya!
COLLEGE HUMOR
Opening Sequence
amir: Alright, mate, you said that?
jake: You said you could do a British accent.
amir: British, yeah.
Episode
jake: Oh my god, get up, get up right now.
amir: What? I'm having a shit day, lemme just sit for half a second!
jake: Sit at your own desk, dude!
jake: Ugh you farted!
amir: Jesus, somebody forgot to take their douchebag pills today!
jake: That would make me not a douchebag.
amir: What?
jake: If I forgot to take douchebag pills, then I wouldn't be a douchebag.
amir: Exactly!
jake: What?
amir: What?
jake: Dude, stop talking to me. For the rest of the day.
amir: I'll tell you why I had a shit day, but you gotta promise not to tell anyone.
jake: That makes me wanna know less.
amir: So, here I am crashing a quinceaera like my name was Martn! All of a sudden, I lift up a cake and pop goes my weasel!
jake: Hey, do me a favour man!
amir: Back massage. No, foot massage. Head massage. What kind of massage do you want? Neck massage? Shin massage? Calf massage? I mean
that's kind of a weird massage but I could probably do it.
jake: They'd all be weird massages!
amir: Yeah!
jake: Yeah! What?! Just fast forward to the end of the story, okay! I don't have time to hear a three minute story that just ends in me
feeling more sorry for you than I already do!
amir: Fine! So Kobayashi follows me here and I owe him uh uh uh uh I owe him uh uh I owe him uh lunch.
jake: Kobayashi?
amir: Did I stutter?
jake: Yes, a lot.
amir: Yeah.
jake: Kobayashi, like the hotdog eating guy?
amir: He holds the world record for twinkies and wings too, but yeah he's in the kitchen and I have to force feed him 20 hotdogs for
lunch. How do you think that makes me feel? So I go pick up the frozen dogs and uh! Pop goes my weasel again.
jake: So he's in the kitchen.
amir: Yeah.
jake: I can just walk into the kitchen right now and see world record holder Kobayashi sitting there waiting for you to feed him
hotdogs.
amir: Yeah.
amir: Uh wait! If you trusted me you don't even have to verify it with your eyes, you would just believe in your heart that it's real
and you don't have to go see it.
amir: Where are you going?
 
amir: Ohhhh yeah!
jake: This is really weird. I think even by your standards we can agree that this is really weird. Right? What do you want me to say?
I'm sorry I doubted you.
amir:  Yeah!
jake: I thought all your stories were lies.
amir:  Yeah.
jake: Especially this one.
amir and kobayashi:  Yeah.
jake: Hey this is pretty sweet man, can I feed him?
jake: No, hey! Hey hey hey! Dude! What do I do?!
amir: Make yourself big!
jake: Big?! That's for bears!
amir: Yeah, yeah, it's bears!
jake: He's not a bear!
amir: He is a bear! He is a bear!
Outro
pat: Woah, woah!
jake: Just let me sit here for one second, okay? I've had a shit day.
pat: Aghh!
amir: Hey, you're watching an all-new episode--
jake: Time's running out.
amir: I can finish it if--
amir:  'Will you just go to the bathroom? Will you just go to the bathroom?' Just once I'd like to go to the bathroom not because he's telling me but because I made the decision myself. Jake is chill as shit, but sometimes he's a nerd. I don't even have to go, it's like----Oh, oh no. Wow, a little gas. Nothing to see here! -- . Oh no, here we go. Ohhh, mmmm, oh my God,  poops I shitted again! Wow, that felt big! I'm gonna look down just in a case it's a-- holy shit, yeah, oh my  that's a record breaker. Three footer, easy, four soaking wet, two dry, two and a half moist, no coil either, just a straight shot. Thicker than a soda can, too. My God, it looks like a boa constrictor trying to get out of a septic tank. I'm a hero and a cool. I gotta snap a pic. W-w-wait! The minute I turn around to snap a pic, the toilet is gonna automatically flush! No! Oh my God! Stop crying, stop crying--okay, cry, cry, let it out, you deserve this! You don't cry that much and even if you did no one would begrudge these tears! Just cry, let it all out, then move past it! Okay okay okay, think! Think think think, you idiot. There's gotta be a way to snag a pic without getting up. Go through your legs.  Nope, too dark. It's too fricken dark. Ugh, unbelievable. You caught a seventy pound bass and you have to throw it back before  anybody even gets to behold its beauty! Good luck bragging about something that doesn't even exist! It looks like ten brown slinkies glued together and nobody's gonna believe a goddamn thing. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!
pat:  Are you okay in there, man? It smells like cheese and gasoline.
amir: No, I'm not okay! I just gave birth to a brown elephant trunk and I'm afraid I'm gonna lose her to the great unknown!
pat:  Oh my God, that is ripe! 
amir:  Just stand up! Just stand up and do it, you coward! There's no way that log's getting flushed down anyway! No, no, no, greater fortunes have been lost on less risky propositions! You have to be rational here!
amir: Jake, listen, it's me--don't hang up, don't hang up, don't hang up, okay? I don't want you to do anything weird, I just need you to come over here and put your hand over the sensor so I can stand up and take a picture of my enormous dump. Hello, hello? Ugh!
amir:  Dildo! He's a dildo! Ugh! Think, think think think. Uh. This is what you have to do. Take off your shirt and pants, put them over the motion sensor so that it still thinks you're still sitting down, and stand up and take the pic right away! Ha!  This makes me a genius, official genius and a cool. From now on nobody will think of Amir Blumenfeld as the guy who couldn't take a shit the size and girth of twelve rubber hoses banded together and dipped and brown paint, no! But rather as a pimp and a philosopher. The best two things you can be.
amir:  Okay, here we go, Hurwitz. Turn around and snag the pic. Your life as you know it will officially change. Promise me this. Whatever people say, you'll stay humble.  I promise.  Three, two, one...
amir: Oh no! No, no, no!
amir: By the way, I know what you're gonna say, but don't bother because I promised myself I'd stay humble, also, thanks for the bathroom suggestion, comprende. Guess what, didn't have to go-ohhh...

INTRO
Amir- Hey you're watching Jake and-A BEAR? What the hell is that?
Jake- Focus, man.
amir: No!
jake: What?
amir: None of your business, alright? My little cousin sent me this questionnaire to fill out over email because he has to do a profile on somebody he respects for his journalism class.
jake: Why'd you say none of my business and then immediately answer my question?
amir: Will you help me answer these questions or not? I just forwarded you the email.
jake: Yeah, you did:  amir@dailydizzydinkydeals.com, you gotta change that email address.
amir: Thanks for the tip!  Seriously, thank you for the tip, but can you help me out, please?
jake: What's so hard about the survey?  What are some characteristics of a good employee at
your company?
amir: I mean I hate to say this ... but throwing lit matches on people while they're taking a dump.
jake: You should hate to say that. Everybody else hates when you do it.  Where do you see yourself in five years?
amir: Just say 'Go fuck yourself'.
jake: Why does your cousin respect you?
amir: Is that in there?
jake: You said it! Right up top, you said your cousin had to do a profile on somebody he respects.
amir: Is the question on the questionnaire?
jake: -And you just said 'Go fuck yourself' to him. What grade is he in?
amir: Third, he's repeating the third grade.
jake: You know what, Where do you see yourself in five years? let's write 'dead', and hope for the best, right?
amir:  Yeah.
jake:  How important was your high school education in getting your job? Do you think it's important for high-schoolers to take their education seriously?
amir: Stop that right there-
jake: -I was done.
amir: -Let me answer that question with a rap: 
Math? Ha! Math was crap.
If you wanna know why, then steal a hen.
Learning shit is for nerds and jocks.
Don't believe me? Ask my uncle.
Green, blue, brown, and red.
Go to school and you regret it.
I got ninety nine problems, and a bitch  ate one.
jake: Jesus Christ, that was the worst thing I've ever heard in my entire life.
amir:  I know...
jake: You don't know. You couldn't possibly know how bad it was because if you did, you probably would've
never attempted to say it in front of anybody.
amir: News flash! 
jake: Oh, shave 'em!
amir: That only took me a week. Yeah, I did that over the course of several weekends, so who feels bad now?
jake: You should.
amir: I do.

amir: Bad.
jake: What an awful, ugly pair of sentences. Yeah, bad!
amir: -Agreed, agreed.
jake: -You agree? Why'd you do it?
amir: At best? It sucked.
jake: Dude, I feel bad for you! I legit feel bad for you; that was like one of the simplest things I've ever seen
you struggle with.
amir: I know, the beat sucked shit, too.
jake: No it didn't, the beat was fine.
amir: Okay, good, because my cousin Leeron came up with it. I'm glad he did something right. 
jake: Did he come up with the rap?
amir: No, that was all me.
jake: So it sounds like he did everything right, and you did everything wrong.
amir: Mhm.
jake: I think I have to turn off my computer and just go home, that really ruined my day.
amir: Yeah, it was suck suck. I think, I think I'm gonna have to turn off my computer and go home too, I mean I
feel bad about myself.
jake: 
amir: Beat was crap, the rap was crap-
jake: -Beat was fine, beat was good! Rap was really bad.
amir: Absolutely-Hey! You're preaching to the chair.

jake: Hey dude, kinda weirded out that you asked my mom out on a date over Facebook.
amir: Top Ten Beers to Chug, by Amir Valerie Hurwitz.
jake: Don't.....
amir: Oh yeahh!
jake: Look, she just signed up for Facebook, and the first thing she gets is a request from you saying that the two of you guys are in a relationship.
amir: Number ten! PBR? Give me CPR! I just drowned in bliss! One can for this fun man, and I'm about to rock out with your cock out! Cock-a-doodle yours!
jake: I don't wanna rock out like that.
amir: Neither do I! Number nine: feeling fine, with any tall boy or cold one I can find. Lists are meaningless when you love that golden oat soda as much as I do!  Booze!
jake: My mom is married.... to my dad.... and they're both kind of freaked out about that message that you sent her.
amir: Number eight: feeling grand!
jake: Should've said great, right?
amir: Don't interrupt me cause I'm eighty deep down in that vodka and red bull like it's my snob.... that's a beer!
jake: No it's not.... it's vodka and red bull.... stop....
amir: Seventh heaven! Nantucket Cisco Brewery Whale's Tail Pale Ale for this frail gale, gets me off the rails.... for rail!
jake: That's a solid rhyming effort, but I really just wish you didn't send my mom a picture of you with your penis tucked behind your legs, with the caption "Another day at the
races," crossed out, "Another gay in my braces," crossed out, "Another day in your graces," crossed out....
amir: Number 666, the devil's number for God's creation! Got a Heinie in one hand, and a Heinie in the other! She's got a buttock so firm, you can slap her without telling her about it first!
jake: That is not the case, ever! And look, real quick, just as an aside, explain why you wrote all this on a scroll? Like on some ancient scroll that you seem to have?
amir: Five, who cares? So long as it's in a glass or a can, you can kiss my ass, with a fan! Any beer will do when you're nose deep in that ish like Winnie the Bear!
jake: Pooh!
amir: She's a bear!
jake: She's a he!
amir: She's a he!
jake: It doesn't matter, you know what? Because my dad just emailed me. You're spamming his Facebook wall with big dick porn! I mean how dare you?
amir: Number four: a simple Rose.
jake: Not a beer.....
amir: Number three, for me, is anything free! I'm talking about what a patron doesn't finish at the bar, I'm chugging that bitch, and running real far!
jake: Terrible way to live your life! Make a change!
amir: Numero duo: this glass is cracked, on your ass crack. I'm talking a Newcastle for this Jew rascal. One and, uh, not done.... I want two!
jake: Stop yelling.
amir: Number one!
jake: I'm just gonna go ahead and guess that it's either not a beer or it doesn't matter....
amir: It. Don't. Matter. So long as I'm slurping it with the woman of my dreams....
jake: My mom?
amir: My mom!
jake: Wait, my mom or your mom?
amir: Your mom!

waitress: I'm not allowed to, nor would I want to.
amir:  Fair enough.
waitress: Excuse me.

amir:  Hey Jake it's me, I'm at P.G.I. Fugley's. Come on by! Later.
amir:  Hey Micah, it's Amir. Your brother did not pick up the phone. I assume he's dead. I'm sorry to have to tell you that, but he's probably long gone. If you hear from him, have him call me, okay? I'm at P.G.I. Fugley's. Bye.
amir:  Mrs. Hurwitz, Amir freaking, no, speaking. Both your sons are being coward factories. Have them call me back immediately.
amir:  Shirley, hi, uh, Amir, from Connecticut Police Department. Um, I have reason to believe that your neighbor, or I know for a fact that all of your neighbors are dead.
amir: Oh! And if it's not too much trouble, it is my birthday, so...
waitress: Oh, happy birthday!

waitress: Okay, I guess we could. Just give me a second.
amir: Thanks, doll, appreciate it!
waitress:  Yeah, don't call me that!

waiter: My name is Terrence; I'm adopted!
amir: D for effort. That felt forced. Leave the cake and get out of my face. Chloe, you can stay, but only if you want to!
waitress: I'm good.
jake: Hey, hey dude. Are you alright?
amir: Scared to join me?  Moo-oo-ahh-ahh-ahh!
jake: You tweeted you were gonna kill yourself in a P.G.I. Fugley's bathroom!
amir: Shame.
jake: Yeah, you are. Will you stop calling my family? Okay? Did you-  Did you tell them it was your brithday?
amir: If you're asking whether or not I got a free cake-
jake: -I'm not.

Episode
amir:  Vaguely. Vaguely. Haha! No man. There's a disconnect here. Haha! No man. Consider it dumb. We'll play it
by year. There's a disconnect here. Vaguely. Absurd. Vaguely? Bye.  How's that for a normal conversation?
jake: It wasn't.
amir: Who with, good question.
jake: Didn't ask it.
amir: My friend Den.
jake: Dan?
amir: Den.
jake: Dan?
amir: Den.
jake: Ben?
amir: Den.
jake: Den?
amir: Yes.
jake: Dan?
amir: Den.
jake: Din?
amir: Den.
jake: Den? Like the room?
amir: Yeah exactly right, like the room. We used to razz him about that all the time, we used to be like, Uh oh, here comes Snatcher!
Sorry, I'm thinking of my friend Snatcher.
jake: Right, Snatcher.
amir: Den.
jake: Dan?
amir: So yeah, Den is more of a friend, than a friend of a friend.
jake: I would have presumed that anyway.
amir: Don't presume! Okay, cause then you make a pres out of um and e.
jake: That's not the phrase.
amir: Anyway you heard the call. Two normal people having a nice normal conversation.
jake: I think I see what happened here. You obviously took to heart what I said last week when I said?
amir: Refresh my memory?
jake: I was about to?
amir: Refresh my memory then.
jake: I was about to?
amir: Okay, out with it.
jake: ?and you interrupted me!
amir: Say it? What is it?
jake: You do that a lot, you start talking?
amir: Okay I won't say anything.
jake: ?when other people are talking.
amir: Ready?
jake: Don't ask me if I'm ready to start?
amir: Ready?
jake: Yes, I'm ready. Are you not gonna talk?
amir: No, I'm not.
jake: Give me five seconds?
amir: Five seconds?
jake: Five seconds. Don't?
amir: Five seconds of silence here we go, ready? Five, four, three?
jake: Don't count down! You counting is not being silent, right? Just?
amir: What were you gonna say?
jake: You obviously took to heart what I said last week when I said I've never heard you have a normal conversation with a normal
person in your entire life.
amir: I don't recall...
jake: Unzip that hoodie?
jake: Aww, don't be proud! That shirt says I've never had a normal conversation with a normal person in my entire life. I'm a loser!
You added that in!
amir: Lucky, breast.
jake: When I told you that last week you welled up. You welled right up like I told you your parents were dead.
amir: I wish.
jake: Wow, dark. You welled up and you said, I'll show you you piece of clid.
amir: Yeah!
jake: I'll show you I have a friend so normal you won't believe it. Then you sprinted out of the office and I haven't seen you since.
I can only presume?
amir: Don't.
jake: ?that you were eavesdropping on people's conversations, writing down everything you heard and then getting all of them wrong.
amir: I got all of them right!
jake: No, you didn't! You don't consider things dumb!
amir: You consider me dumb!
jake: Right, because you also don't play things by year.
amir: Yes, I do!
jake: No, the phrase is you play things by ear.
amir: Oh okay so what are you, twelve ears old?
jake and amir: What?!
jake: You should have heard more than those five phrases by the way. And you didn't leave any space, so I can't imagine what, what was
his name? Dan?
amir: Den.
jake: Den? I can't imagine what Den was saying during that conversation. You should have left some pauses in there.
 pops up from behind Jake)
den: Amir!
amir: Den!
jake: Jesus.
den: Vaguely?
amir: Vaguely.
den: Vaguely.
amir:  Vaguely?
den: Vaguely.
amir: Haha! No man.
den: There's a disconnect here.
amir: Consider it dumb.
den: Play it by year?
amir: What year?
den: Play it by one year?
amir: What year?
den: Hey what year is it?
amir: 2010.
den: 2011? Wanna play it by that?
amir: Consider it dumb.
den: Absurd.
amir: Den!
den: There's a disconnect here.
amir: Vaguely.
den: Bye.
amir: Den!
jake: You know, what I said still stands, because that was not a normal conversation with a normal person.
amir:  That's why I'm keeping the shirt on!

amir: It reads fast
vincent: It doesn't. You wanna pick your cast?
amir: Yes! Okay... Jake, why don't you play Darrel McMexican
jake: Such an offensive name.
amir: He's like a rogue CIA agent with a heart of cold.
jake: But McMexican?

amir: Which is fine, yeah
jake: Second of all, I'm not improvising.
vincent:   As Darrel grabs his heart, not just his chest but literally he grabs his heart, his girlfriend enters. 81 years young, jet black hair, like a jet, has Pussy Sandwich for a name.
emily:  Darrel, Darrel, Darrel McMexican, how are you?
amir: You're improvising a little too much for my liking , but that's fine.
jake: She's not improvising at all.
emily:  It's me. Pussy, Pussy Sandwich. I'm buxom and blonde as the sun.
murph: Awesome babe, that was so hot
jake:  I look at you and I want to know more about you. Are you a foodie?
amir: Okay, okay, great. So here comes the emotional crux of the whole...piece as it were. Please, as alway's improvise, adlib, yeah, but  verbatim! I can't stress that enough. Stick to the script.
vincent:  Pussy Sandwich let's out a high pitched queef. We can't hear it, but everyone knows it's there for sure. Dogs from around the city start sprinting to McMexican's apartment. We hear thuds, barking, pounding. These dog's wanna get in and see what's what. They know it's coming from Pussy.  What they don't know is how or why.
amir:  Wow...
emily:  Kiss me you fool, taste my tongue, you gaylord fool. My hair is as red as a green apple.
murph:  WOAH!
jake:  W..W...What!? Dude!
murph:  TASTE MY TONGUE!?!
jake:  SHE'S TALKING SHE SAID IT!
murph:  Are you REALLY talking to my girl like that!?!? Are you REALLY!?!?!
jake: I'm not talking to her at all! She was talking to me!
murph: YOU ARE! YOU ARE! OK!
jake:  I DIDN'T EVEN WRITE THIS, AMIR WROTE THIS!
murph:  Oh yeah, what's going on here!?
amir: He was improvising.
jake: I DIDN'T IMPROVISE!
murph: Your ass is mine McMexican! Your ass is MIIIIINNNNNNEEEEEEEUUUUUUAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!!!
jake:  What the fuck man!
END SCENE
murph: I don't know what happened back there. I just... I lost it. I love you so much.
emily: I love you too.
murph: And I just feel like I need to work on my anger problems...
emily:  No, no, if anything  I want you to be angrier, crazier. Can you do that for me?
murph:  Absolutely.

amir: Hey, you're watching Jake... and I guess that's it cause I suck!
jake: Wow, come on.
jake: Hey, Man.
amir: Hey, Man.
jake: How you feelin'?
amir: Bueno.
jake: Buddy, you're not "Bueno".
amir: I'm not your "Buddy", Buddy.
jake: Go home, just go home.
amir: You would love that, wouldn't you?
jake: Yes, everyone would love that. You're covered  in puke and shit.
amir: And... shit!
jake: Said that, I said "shit".
amir: It's called 'food poisoning'.
jake: Exactly, and when you have it, you go home.
amir: I'm toughing it out!
jake: You're obviously not toughing it out, right? You've been crying this entire time. Will you at least go to the bathroom?
amir: Losers go to the bathroom. Winners go to the back room, to get blows.
jake: Right, no one is going to "blows" you. Okay? Your crotch is covered in your own feces. Which is kind of crazy considering feces is supposed to come out the back.
amir: Yeah, it did come out the back but then the smell was just overpowering me so I flipped the script, switched the pants around.
jake: Weird logic.
amir: If I could feel my arms, honestly, I'd give you a noogie right now.
jake: Right, wouldn't let you give me a noogie because your fingers, like your crotch, is just covered in your own shit and puke.
amir: Why did this happen to me?
jake: Because for dinner you had a raw chicken, egg, and cheese sandwich on a frozen hot pocket.
amir: I knew you'd bring that up.
jake: You asked me! You washed the entire meal down with a glass of warm toilet water.
amir: It was a dare.
jake: Everybody was daring you to not do it.
amir: Yeah, and guess what? I chickened out! Hehe, raw chicken that is! vomits Oh, look at me, I have diarrhea of the mouth, and diarrhea of the south.
jake: So, just regular diarrhea?
amir: No, bueno.
man: Eeeh, Jake, the pizza's here. Oh...
man 2: So, Amir's still here.
amir: Oh, I get it. You didn't come in here to bond with me. You came in to ask me to leave.
jake: Yeah, dude, I've been trying to kick you out of the office since I got here.
amir: Well, I guess it's first come, first slerve on the Zsa Zsa Gabor. So, outta my way, dimwits. I'm looking for...
jake: Dude, come on.
amir: You want the nice golden brown. This is not...
jake: Don't! At least let me hand you a slice, you're getting shit all over the pizza.
amir: Wait a second, is this cheese pizza?
jake: What are you talking about? It's pizza!
amir: Yeah, but you didn't say it was cheese! Aw, I'm going to yarf.
jake: Fine, don't yarf near the pizza!
amir: It's too late, I'm actually mid yarf.
jake: You're not mid yarf, at least turn your head.
amir: Keep the box open!
jake: No, you can't even turn your head?
man 2: Aw, Jake, you ruined the pizza.
jake: Amir ruined the pizza.
man: You puked on it.
amir: Go home, Jake!
man 3: What happened?
man 2: Jake ruined the pizza, he's sick.
collective chant: Go home, Jake!

jake: Okay, dude, sorry but you have to stop posting on Reddit
amir: Relax, I only post cool and interesting stories, at most, one a month
jake: You've posted thirty nine hundred times today
amir: I said at most
jake: Then you're using that word wrong
amir: You're a bigger circlejerking diva than the commenters, and that's saying a lot
jake: Right, the last thing you uploaded thirty seconds ago was a picture of the guy from Futurama with, I think this is your dick-
amir: interrupting -it's not
jake: photoshopped onto his forehead-
amir: interrupting again -oh yeah it is
jake: The text not sure if y'all commenters are a bunch of circlejerking divas or if I'm universally hated by everybody, it's the second thing
amir: It's called a me-me
jake: No, it's called a meme, wow y'no you also tried to start a ton of AMAs. I am a coward and a fool who's dad moved out on him not once not twelve but a dozen times, Ask me anything
amir: Yeah
jake: My dad is a diva, ask me anything
amir: Yeah
jake: I'll go dickless for Michael Chiklis, ask me almost anything
amir: Yeah
jake: What is that?
amir: AMAs, okay? Its like an interview, it stands for ask me anywh-time
jake: Wrong. What the fuck is going dickless for Michael Chiklis?
amir: I needed the upvotes
jake: You never get any upvotes, you have thousands of downvotes.
amir: It's called 'karma' Jake, and correct me if I'm wrong  but I got a lot of it
jake: you are wrong
amir: then correct me
jake: what are these hundreds and hundreds of posts on /r/trees just picture after picture of you trying to light a joint, your eyebrows on fire and you're crying and smiling.
amir: I'm an ent that needed the uptokes
jake: okay right I see that I am high as a knife, ask me anything if this gets a thousand uptokes I won't kill myself? So sad.
amir: How's this for sad? I was at a three when I wrote that
jake: That is sad because that's not very high and you went to a really dark place, threatened to kill yourself in an online community where everybody hates you
amir: Will you just uptoke it okay? I'll go dickless for Chiklis literally this afternoon if you uptoke it
jake: I won't, because you know what? your comments on all these other posts are actually really mean, like on this-
amir: interrupting awh, one example? give me one example
jake: at the same time - video of a dog, are you serious, I'll give you a ton of examples, okay? like on this video of a dog squealing with joy when his soldier owner comes home
amir: I already know what you're gonna say, okay? and just know that I did it for the lols
jake: You did this for lols why the bitch is this on the front page? am I the only one who thinks dogs aren't cute or capable of having real emotions
amir: yeah
jake:if this gets downvoted I'll shut up, my dick is off for Michael Chick if this gets one more D-vote
amir: and guess what man...
jake: Hundreds of downvotes
amir: really?
jake: Yeah, do you not check, do you follow up at all?
amir: no I never go back
jake: You would be depressed if you went through your reddit history, okay, here's another picture posted here of the pope and the caption says prays for starving children while sitting on a golden throne.
amir: laughs
jake: what, you think that's funny now
amir: yeah
jake: cause you didn't when you left this comment atheist fucks going to hell for talking smack about this God guy, bury me with downvotes if you disagree. You know, why do you, why do you ask for the downvotes?
amir: I'm like a martyr
jake: but if you agree, meet me at blockbuster, because we're renting rampart and then ramming each other's farts, then right under that you write Commenter above me is a philosopher, upvote him to karma heaven
Amir mock prays
jake: Right under that you write I am the pope in this picture, ask me anything
amir: that thread was dead
jake: stop trying to protect yourself, you're coming up with excuses, just admit nobody on Reddit likes you
amir: nobody likes me
jake: This guy 'ForthewolfX' replied to you saying leave Reddit alone, love, everybody and his comment got  thousands of upvotes
amir: oh
jake: and in response you decided to post a picture of Calvin trying to piss on Michael Chiklis, but there's no pee
amir: yeah,  guess why
jake: did he go dickless-
amir: - he went dickless for him, yeah, exactly right, ask him anytime.
INTRO

jake: Watching it, actually.
amir: Amir. Is my name.
amir: I spent a lot of time in high school doing Habitat for Humanity - you know, building houses - but instead of real nails, I would use these dissolvable sugar studs that I would get at novelty stores, and, like, always: six months later, I would check the news, and that house would - BOOM  - collapse. Two dead, three dead, four at a time, just gone.
jake: What the hell is wrong with you?
ben:  Hey diddly-dee, a sailors life for--  How are you? How is everything? This is what's happening: I'm goin' around this office, asking people-- because you know what happened? Some party pooper took a dump inside the copier, and I'm tryin' to find out who it was...

Opening Sequence
amir: Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir. You like my underwear?
jake: That's your penis.
amir: Alright.
Episode
amir: Mm. Hit?
jake: No.
amir: Come over.
jake: No.
amir: Smoking a hookah.
jake: I see that.
amir: Not that big of a deal.
jake: You know, it's actually not, but clearly think it is. Otherwise you wouldn't have gotten to work, set up the entire hookah, and
then waited for me to get here so you could ask me to smoke with you.
jake: Nothing's coming out of your mouth so you're definitely not blowing smoke rings.
amir: Don't blow smoke up my ass.
jake: I don't think that's lit, man.
amir: I have strawberry. I have strawberry and apple and watermelon and mint, and mint is the bomb, and it's smooth, and if you mix it
with strawberry it tastes like a mojito.
jake: Why do you think this is cool?
amir: Why is drinking alcohol cool? Hm? Why is riding on a motorcyle cool? Why is wearing SPF of less than 10 at the beach cool?
jake: I don't that think that is cool.
amir: Because it's dangerous! Being safe is for mothers and nerds, and last time I checked, I'm have a pussy.
jake: ...what?!
amir: I said I don't have a pussy!
jake: No you didn't! You didn't say that! You said I'm have a pussy!
amir: Yeah!
jake: Have you even done any work at all today?
amir:  Yeah.
jake: So setting up the hookah was your work.
amir: No, I also did regular work.
jake: Where's your computer? It's not out.
amir:  It's in my fricking backpack!
jake: Is there a fucking cat in there with it?!
amir: Chill it with this line of questioning, okay! It's not becoming of either of us. You're stressing me out.
jake: Your computer's not out, it's not on; you haven't done any work at all.
amir: I've been checking my Gmail on my work phone.
jake: You have a work phone?
amir:  Yeah I have a work phone.
jake: Where's your phone?
amir:  It's here.
jake: In the bag.
amir:  Yeah, in the bag.
jake: How are you checking it?
jake: Gimme your phone.
amir: Careful, it's dirty!
jake: It smells like soy sauce and yoghurt!
amir: Yeah, the lock screen is all... messed up. It's like
jake: Not the lock screen. All the buttons are just stuck together, it's one giant button. You ruined your phone.
amir: I'm starting to not even be in the mood to smoke.
jake: Stop trying so hard.
amir: Why? Huh? Because you shouldn't try to be cool! You should just be yourself and not care what other people think?
jake: Yes.
amir: No! No, absolutely not! Last week, I paid 2000 dollars for a getting-with-chicks seminar. And guess what happened: final exam
time rolls around and we're at a bar, and every single one of us hooks up with a girl. that's right: we all made out like bandits. And
on my way home, guess what i saw: the teacher of the class, Sean, he was discreetly paying every single girl that made out with us
nerds money. And you know why?
jake: Because he hired whores to french you so you'd feel better about yourself!
amir: Because I'm cool!
jake: You know, with two grand you probably could have paid girls to do a lot more than just make out with you.
amir: What.
INTRO
amir: Jake, Jake, Jake. Jake Jake Jake. Jake your booty.
jake: Stop!
amir:  Hey, dude, thanks for meeting me here.
jake:  Oh, bad odor!
amir: So how do people make money today?
jake: I'm not meeting you here. Ok, I was just in here.
amir: That's right, creating iPad apps.
jake: Don't think that I agreed to a meeting.
amir: And, what better way to create iPad apps than in a meeting that both people agreed to?
amir: Ok, first app idea. You know how it's hard to manage your time, like time management?
jake: Sure.
amir: So this is just a list of other shit that's hard to deal with.
jake: Really? Number one says wiping.
amir: Yes.
jake: That shouldn't be that hard.
amir: And yet it is.
jake: No it's not.
amir: Ok.
jake:  Sorry, just look at your iPad, right? It's covered in cracks and barbecue sauce.
amir: I was trying to change the battery on this piece of junk.
jake: You haven't tried to clean it! Ok, treat your stuff better!
jake: Number two on your list of shit that's hard to deal with is not shaking foreigners and demanding they speak English. Awful.
amir: That's an example of something I do all the time.
jake: I know.
amir: The hardest thing anyone has to deal with, emotionally, is finding out that a loved one doesn't feel anything for them anymore.
jake: What's the app?
amir: I'm not always talking about apps.
amir: So, you hate the Papua New Guinean community, I hate the Papua New Guinean community. So let's just agree-
jake: Stop, I don't hate the Papua New Guinean community.
amir: Ok. So this app might be a dud. 
amir: This one's pretty slick, actually, it's an app called burger and you use it when you're hungry.
jake: How?
amir: It's a picture of a burger and, uh, ya eat your iPad. 
jake: Cool, so that's why you have the, uh-
amir: Barbecue sauce everywhere, no, that was for a different app called ribs and it's not what it sounds like. That was a picture of-
jake: Ribs.
amir: Exactly right, how did you-
jake: How is that not what it sounds like?
amir: You're getting defensive.
jake: Oh my-
amir: It's called Photobooth and you can use it to take goofy pictures of yourselves.
jake: That app has been around for a while.
amir: Yeah, well I created a lens for it, called fisheye.
jake: I feel so bad for you, man.
amir: If you're gonna call me out on every single white lie I tell, just, just leave, I'm serious man.
jake: Fine. 
amir: Bahh! When I'm done!
jake: What is that noise?
amir: What noise?
jake: It just comes out of your mouth when I go to leave. 
amir: I guess so- Bahh!
amir: You're in a bad place right now and I feel like even if I pitched you a good idea you wouldn't be into it.
jake: You haven't pitched me a good idea so don't worry about that, right?
amir:  Alright.
jake: Actually you know what?  I'm gonna take away the iPad. Because it costs a lot of money and you don't know how to take care of it. Sorry.
amir: Oh my God, I have a case for it, relax.
jake: The case has more barbecue sauce on it than the iPad.
amir: Call me out. Call me out in front of all your big friends so that I can feel small.
jake: Don't talk to me like a bitter boyfriend or something.
amir: Don't compartmentalize me like I'm a chore.
jake: You spit all over my fucking arm just now.
amir:  I hate when we fight like this.
jake: Stop!
amir: Alright, so this one's a hoot and a half.  What's the hardest part about reading?
jake: Finding the time.
amir: Ok, never mind.
jake: Your app idea just says the vowels.
amir: Never mind, I said!
amir: You try to put everything in a box. And if it doesn't fit, ya throw it away.  I'm sorry.
jake: Get-
amir: So you know how Instagram sold for  one billion dollars?
jake: Don't do that.
amir:  So this would be an app that harasses the creators of Instagram until they give us a few million dollars to stop.
jake: Alright, don't take this as a compliment.
amir: Thank you.
jake: That's your best app idea yet.
amir: Appreciate it.
jake: It's still terrible.
amir: Danke.
jake: It's just all your other ideas are so bad.
amir: Gracias. 
jake: Ok, don't take this-
amir: Todah rabah.
jake: Fuck you!
amir:  Ouch.
jake: Hey, brace yourself 'cause this is not gonna be pleasant.
amir: Oh no, constructive criticism!
jake: Quit.
amir:  Ow.
jake: Not even quit while you're ahead, quit while you're behind. None of these ideas were good. I would feel bad telling you to go back to the drawing board.
amir: Right, yeah, yeah.
jake: I feel like there's not even a single nugget of an idea that's worth exploring.
amir: That's fine, Ok.
jake: Furthermore,
amir: Oh?
jake: You're not smart.
amir: No.
jake: You're not getting better.
amir: Nope.
jake: You don't have a mind that's capable of improving itself. You can't even take care of this iPad. So I say, let's toss out the iPad. We'll, we'll find something else for you to do, you know?
amir: Yeah.
jake: With your time.
amir: At least I gave it the old college try, you know?
jake: I'm not sure you did.
amir: Well, at least I tried my best, you know? 
jake: That is sad, because it wasn't even close to being good enough.
amir:  Absolutely  I just, uh. Quit it, alright, you're making me feel weak.
jake: You are weak.
amir:  Enough! Ok, you're not creative!

INTRO
jake: You're watching a buff dude and Amir.
amir:  Ow!
jake: 
amir: Woah, cool tank top.
jake: Woah, cool wrong word for it.
amir: What?
jake: It's called a muscle tee, asswad.
amir: Why?
jake: Actually, scratch that. It's called six months of pumping iron for this one moment.
amir: Do you think that's a normal thing to wear around the office?
jake: You think I'm not going to go to the park during lunch? I don't commit to wearing something that makes me feel vulnerable without having an airtight excuse for every line of questioning. Does that make me insecure? You bet your ass it does.
amir: Just wear a T-Shirt, then, okay? You'll look normal and you won't be as angry.
jake: GQ Teen says the summer look is Toms shoes, Ray Bans, board shorts, and a muscle tee. Or was that Joseph Gordon-Levitt doppelganger that I saw at the Starbucks on 9th Avenue not styling?
amir: Doppelganger?
jake: Wasn't one hundred percent sure it was the 3rd Rock from the Sun star and upon asking for his autograph, I found out it was not. Still snagged this sweet pic though. 
amir: He looks pissed at you.
jake: He was!
amir: So why follow his fashion advice?
jake: Because a sleeveless shirt for this piece of dirt makes that sweet pussy go squirt. 
amir: How?
jake: I 69'd my dad! At a rave!
amir: What?
jake: I was obviously joking, the point is that I attend raves! And while I've never done anything more than kiss a bouncer on the cheek to get in and then be sold fake ecstasy by a sweaty teen, still cooler than your last Tuesday.
amir: I guess-
jake: - I guess? Do you guess? Do you guess?  I shared a fucking glowing pacifier, dude, with a legit five-and-a-half. That's two points hotter than my last girlfriend.
amir: What?
jake:  Da da da dada I'm loving snatch!
amir: That actually is a cool look.
jake: No shlit, dude.
amir: 
jake: No, no! Hey don't you-
amir: I'm going sleeveless! Yeah! A dank tank for this man stank make the poonani smell rank!
jake: That's not a tank! Bad rhyme, doesn't count!
pat:  Woah, woah, hey hey! Look guys, guys: tank top triplets!
jake: Get him outta here!
amir: Get outta here, man!
jake: Get him outta here!
amir:  He 69'ed his dad!
jake: At a rave! Tell him where is was!
amir: It was a rave, yeah.
pat: Why?

amir: These meetings are awful.
amir: They always suck.
coworker : ...I dunno. I-- I like 'em.
amir: The speakers are always a dumb or a chump.
coworker: I've had good experiences, and I've had bad...
amir: Alright. Listen up, everyone: I am your speaker. And despite what this guy thinks,  I'm pretty damn good.
amir: Heheheheh, what're you laughing about, asshole? You just insulted me to my face!
co-worker: But, I--
amir: But-I, but-I, buh-buh-buh-buh-butt-- You are a butt. You're a butt now. Leave.
co-worker: Jesus! I-- I paid five hundred and ninety-five dollars for this seminar.
amir: Okay, how 'bout this: I'll pay you a thousand dollars to get out.
co-worker: ...Okay.
amir: ...Fuck. Um...  yeah... is check fine, or...
co-worker: Yeah. It's fine.
amir: Name?
co-worker: Siggy... Harnoff.
amir: This is so fucked... Why, why, why am I doing this.  Take this and get out of my face.
harnoff: Okay.
amir: Huh. Obviously not my finest moment, heheh. Does anyone know how to stop payment on a check?
co-worker 2 : Wh-why did you do that?
amir: Just shut up, okay? I'll-- I'll give you two thousand dollars to put a sock in it.
co-worker 2: Fine.
amir: Oh my God, dammit! ...Name.
co-worker 2: Gonny.
amir: Well, Gonny, must be your lucky day.  Here. Before I put the checkbook away, does anyone else want money?
co-worker 3: No, uh... we feel bad for you.
amir: Focus, group! Heh! No. Okay: what're we here to learn?
co-worker 3: Search engine optimization.
amir: Exactly right. Now: what do I know about SEO? ...nothing. That's right: I'm not an authority on anything; fuck, guys, I'm not even a decent human being. Let's go to the presentation.
amir:  Blank slide,  test image,  blank slide. It should be a surprise to none of you that I don't know how to work a computer.
amir: So, that took me three years.
jake: Hey, everybody, sorry to interrupt-- okay, weird picture--
amir: Yeah.
jake: Just ran into a lady who was supposed to give a marketing lecture here. She said she was accosted in the elevator. Yeah, a skinny nerd tried to push her into the wall, failed, then started crying, and offered to cut her a four-thousand-dollar check to keep the whole thing under wraps.
amir: Huh...
jake: He said he didn't want everybody to know he was a punk bitch who couldn't even yoke up a forty-five-year-old dame with a heart of cold.
amir: Guys, listen up: Ten thousand dollars to the person who can find that perp and bring him to me, dead or alive.
jake: It was you.
amir: Correctimundo! Ten thousand for the private eye.  ...Name?
END
amir: Jake and Amir long story short--
jake: Late.
amir: Okay
jake: Six hours late--
amir: Guess where I'm going today
jake: I know where you think you're going, the Olympics, but you're not.
amir: Correctanundo! The Olintics!
jake: Why don't you say the reasons you think you're going to the Olympics, and I'll say the reasons you're not.
amir: Speed.
jake: No plane ticket.
amir: Honor.
jake: No event tickets.
amir: U. SS. R.
jake: You don't have a legal passport or birth certificate to travel anywhere.
amir: You mean to tell me I have to buy shit.
jake: Yeah, you do, and you're clearly not opposed to buying shit because I bet that costume wasn't cheap.
amir: 330 euro, yeah, and that was without international shipping and processing!
jake: Why would you ship that American costume internationally?
amir: Because I was gonna pick it up in bloody old England, dumbass!
jake: So what happened?!
amir: Shit happened! Okay? Life got in the way!
jake: Where do you get confidence from?
amir: What?
jake: Where do you get your confidence from?
amir: Huh?
jake: Can you not hear me?
amir: No!
jake: You're always wrong--
amir: Yeah.
jake: You're always wrong--
amir: Okay.
jake: Yet you're overflowing with confidence!
amir: That's a humble brag.
jake: Go home.
amir: I started a Twitter account!
jake: Fine.
amir: Oooh! I was gonna save it for you birthday!
jake: It would've been a bad gift.
amir: Yeah well wait 'til you hear what the username is!
jake: What.
amir: USA Rice!
jake: How was that gonna be my birthday gift?
amir: USARice is fun. He's fun and happy and he's positive and he's everything that I'm not and if you're just gonna shit on him then you're a grinch now.
jake: Yup, here we go, first tweet: The sun is shining, the grass is green, and guess what's for breakfast? Anything is possible.
amir: Anything is possible, yeah!
jake: How is this a gift?!
amir: Don't even make me feel a little bit bad about any of these tweets, okay! Otherwise I'll delete my entire freaking account.
jake: Feel stupid about all of these tweets! Especially this one that says I'm from the USA but I'm voting for Rice. That's not fun or positive. That's just a bad tweet that you made.
amir: Negative! Poison!
jake: Go to the Olympics!
amir: I wish I could, honestly, but you've been waterboarding me with so much haterade that I don't know if I can get my mojo going enough to bring me or the youth group to merry old Scotland!
jake: England.
amir: Close enough.
jake: I guess, what youth group?
amir: I sponsored a teen tour!
jake: Stop yelling weird shit at me.
amir: I'm supposed to chaperone 20 youngsters from all over the states and bring them to the Olympics.
jake: You know what, I'm gonna call bullshit on that one too.
kid: I can't wait to kiss Michael Phelps. As promised!

amir: Wow, yo, you're such a surfer guy.
jake: Come on.
jake: Alright, thank you for coming in. So the internship here is-
amir : UNAVAILABLE, hi, Amir Blumenfeld. Whoa, weak grip.
jake: This isn't a couch. I said you could help me conduct these interviews if-
amir : if you lead the charge I know. You know they say to dress for the job you want but I don't know if we have any openings in the hooker division.
jake: Leave.
amir: Ya heard him. Leave.
jake: What's your biggest weakness?
interviewee: Well my eyesight isn't perfect.
amir: Ha ha ha. You just cost yourself the job dumbass. Bad eyes, no, bad you.
jake: You know, you wear glasses.
amir: Because I can't see without them, Jake.
amir: Listen, you're gonna get sexually harassed working here, okay dude? Massages and more are par for the course especially looking like you do. How much you bench kid?
interviewee: I don't know if I want to work here anymore.
amir: Ooh, playing hard to get I like that. Now I gotta have you. Hehe. Lie down.
jake: Leave, quick.
amir: What is this? Is it something that I said or did?
jake: I think it was both.  Because you said You'll never work in this town again and then you boxed her ears.
amir: If she's waiting for an apology from me I can outlast this diva queen. With her drama.
amir: What's your sexual orientation kiddo?
jake: Whoa, whoa!
amir: Alright you don't have to answer that, you don't have to answer that.
jake: You legally can't ask that.
amir: Can you cover your ears for just like a second. Heh thanks.  I'm trying to play it cool but I'm 90 percent sure this kid is Shia LaBeouf.
jake: It's definitely not.
amir: Uncover now. Hey, great thanks. Two questions for you, one: When can you start and two what was it like working with and kissing with Megan Fox!
amir: You know what I did to the last chick that was in here? I boxed her fricken ears. Hard.
jake: He really did.
amir: Just a really big fan and that's all I'm gonna say okay from here on out you're just another dude to me. Heh. Follow up question, what was it like sharing the screen with Hollywood legend Harrelson fricken Ford.
jake: You know his name on his resume says Michael Fink.
amir: Yeah because you don't put your real name on shit. Not when you're A-list. Dumbass.
jake: You're a dumbass.  Why would Shia LaBeouf need an internship?
amir: Call me a dumbass again and I will smack you I swear I don't take kindly to that shit. Sorry Shia you have to see me like this, usually I'm a pretty cool guy but I really don't take kindly to that dumbass shit.
jake: What are you talking about? You're just trying to act tough in front of someone you think is Shia LaBeouf.
amir: Here we go.
jake: Get-
amir : Ow.  Dammit! Sorry, I- I- I promised myself I wouldn't beef in front of the beef, but here I am. No homo.
amir: Okay what if I offered you the job huh? Would that make you feel better babe?
jake: I don't think you should do that because we don't know if she's qualified yet. You boxed her ears pretty much right away.

Intro
jake: Thanks for watching Jake and Amir!
amir: Thanks for what?
jake: Watching.
amir: Yeeaahh.
Script
jake: Flew a kite this weekend.
amir: One second.
jake: Soo sick.
amir : Hello Village Realty! Yes, I am calling about your two-bedroom triplex on East 8th and 1st. She is a beaut. That's right, hot to trot and newsflash: I'm not!  Heh. But the asking price is quite nice, 8k a month plus utilities.
jake: Wow, expensive apartment.
amir: Let me make you an offer you CAN refuse. Heh. I'm writing it down on a slip of paper and let me just know if this offends you.
jake: Hey that's not gonna work.  It just won't work.
amir: Okay I will take your silence to mean that you've accepted my counter of eleven dollars a month plus carte blanche access to your business center, that means you can't kick me out after midnight!
jake: Business center?
amir: Hello? Hello? Mm. Locked down another apartment dude.
jake: I don't think you did.
amir: Moving is tough though, my current place is kind of a dump.
jake: Where is it?
amir: It's the dump.
jake: Oh, god that's sad.
amir : Hello! Yes, Village Realty. Long time listener, second time caller: and I'm baller!  Heh. Oscar the Grouch here speaking and I can say that 'cause I live in a fucking trash can.
jake: You know what, I'm on the site right now, you can't afford any of these apartments.
amir: I'm looking at one listing which is particularly cherry. Though on the contrary, it might be an apple, because it is that of my eye!
jake: Bad.
amir: I'm speaking of course of your seven bedroom quadplex overlooking Central Park West, asking price 38.9 million dollars, so let me do you one worse. Five dollars a month plus carte blanche access to your business center.
jake: Drop the business center.
amir: Yes, that is a very lowball offer, but if I'm doing my math correctly-
jake: I guarantee you, you're not.
amir: You are still netting a cool 1.9 million dollars in commission. Which may not seem like a lot to you but I live in a god damn trash heap so try not to rub it in my face. I already do that enough as is.
jake: Hang up.
amir : Good call, power move.  I'm going to hang up on you right now and you better call me back with a three letter answer: Nah.
jake: Why do you live in a trash heap?
amir: My last landlord was a coward and a thief. AKA: Me. That's right, you're looking at a modern day robin hood, I steal from the bitch and give to the whore.
jake: I have no idea what you're saying. Ever.
amir: Neither do I. Alls I know is that I can't afford first and last month, or any of the ones in between. Uh oh, I am blowing up.
jake: Great.
amir: Yellow is the color of my energy, hello?
jake: Old song.
amir : They have a studio in Hell's Kitchen for nine seventy five a month.
jake: Take it.
amir : Go fuck yourself. I'LL TAKE IT. Hello? They hung up. They hung up on me.
jake: Yeah but they hung up when you said go fuck yourself to them.  Don't you have anybody that you can live with?
amir: Oh, good call.  Hey wanna do mimosas after work?
jake: No, I don't. Hey, no don't do that. Don't shoehorn that in then act like I said yes.
amir: We're on. Mickey my friend!
jake: Jesus Christ.
amir: I have a proposition for you Mickey. Yes, how would you like a new roommate my friend. That's right. That's right I am quiet, I am clean, and just between you and me, I bake a mean frittata.
jake: Why do you want to keep that a secret just between you two?
amir: How does 4,900 dollars a month sound Mickey? That's right, that's first, last, and security Mickey. We can finally start that organic garden Mickey. That's right, just me you and some fresh basil, just the way we always wanted Mickey. Alright excellent Mickey, that sounds great. That sounds great Mickey, come outside. Come outside and help me carry in this boxspring Mickey it looks heavier than it is Mickey. Are you outside, are you coming outside Mickey?
jake: Why do you say his name this much?
amir: You know why I'm not there Mickey?  Because I'm not coming. I'm not gonna be your roommate Mickey. I live in a god damn trash heap and your rent was too damn high. Your mom's bringing us iced tea in mason jars?  Well that doesn't sound like my dream! That doesn't sound like my idea of a good time Mickey. Hold on, I'm getting another call.
jake: Make your phone calls in the conference room from now on.
amir: Oscar the Grouch speaking. That's fine! That's fine I will vacate your trash heap at ten P.M. because you know why? I'll be looking down at that trash heap from Central Park fricken west for five dollars a month in a fricken business center!

jake: Oh.
cheryl: I'm so sorry that my broken heart and my hurt feelings are getting in the way of you getting your work done.
amir: You dick.
cheryl: You diiick.
jake: You know that actually is something you could apologize for.
cheryl: That pussy didn't even have the guts, to break up with me to my face.
jake: How did he do it?
cheryl: In front of all my friends.
jake: So to your face then?
amir: Yea to her freaking face, right to it. In front of all of her friens if you can believe that.
jake: You know I can't believe that because you just told me he didn't do it to your face because he was too much of a pussy.
cheryl: Don't say that word!
jake: What word? Pussy?
cheryl: Yea!
jake: You're saying it.
cheryl: No.
jake: You say it all the time.
cheryl: I'm allowed to say it.  Don't say that word. Don't say that word.
jake: Fine, I won't.
cheryl:  Don't say that word.
jake: I'm not. I stopped.
cheryl: Don't say that word.

Cheryl throws her drink in Jake's face
jake: Weak dude!
cheryl: That's for making Amir feel like a real douchebag about that whole Olympics thing.
jake: You told her about the Olympics thing?
amir: I tell her everything. Cheryl's my oldest chica.
cheryl: I'm fifty!
jake: I-I'm still in awe of that fact.
cheryl: Get over it. I'm here, I'm old, and I'm Stan.
jake: You don't look that old. You're what?
amir: Ok, I know what we're doing tonight.
cheryl: What are we doing tonight.
amir: I'm picking you up and we are having a fuck Todd night. You know why, because-
amir and cheryl: Fuck Todd!
cheryl: Lets pick up a fucking brick or a cinderblock and just throw it into his parent's property or some shit. Lets fucking wreak some real damage.
amir: Let's do it. I hate his fuckin' mom.
jake: You know what, I don't wanna interject here but Cheryl it sounds like you're in the wrong.
cheryl: You could have had this.
jake: I'm sorry, I had a shot at that?
amir: That's right. You coulda been Cheryl's revenge fudge but you had to go off and defend queen pussy Todd.
cheryl: Ya yea.
jake: Ok this is ridiculous. You know what, Todd's a bitch. He is, he's a real bitch. Everything that you've been saying just, I can't even believe he did it, that all that stuff.
Cheryl wipes a tear from her eye.
cheryl: You really believe that?
jake: I really do. You know what else I believe?
cheryl: What do you believe?
jake: He's Dr. Seuss, and I'm Shel Silverstein.
amir: Seems pretty equal.
cheryl: They're not that different.
jake: Equal? What are you talking about? You think Green Eggs and Ham is better than the freaking Giving Tree?
amir: I'm saying they're both kid's authors.
jake: Oh well I'm saying it's not a freaking contest. Babe Ruth and Joe DiMaggio were both baseball players.
amir: Both great, yea very similar baseball players.
cheryl: I don't know...
jake: Yea but which one's bett- you know what that was a weird comparison.
cheryl: Let's do it, let's do this revenge fudge.  I'm just gonna grab my ummm..

jake:  You went to a bodega and got gravy, for this. You're the weakest link.
emily: They're the same fucking size, are you fucking kidding me? These are fucking fake tits! These are the fakest tits I've ever
felt! God, they feel good. I'm gonna make Murph buy me these.
murph: Time! Time! What's my time?
jake: Yeah man it was really quick, but you obviously didn't finish showering. Can't imagine you shit.
murph: I shit in the shower and I tried to smoosh it down the drain. Got everywhere.
jake: You call this getting ready?
murph: As ready as I'll ever be.
jake: Holy shit dude, you're proposing! This is insane! Wash your hand! When are you gonna do it?!
murph: Tonight!
jake: After we leave?
murph: During you're here!
jake: What?
murph: I mean I want it to be intimate, so I figure, what's more intimate than a double date?
jake: Single date.
murph: Hah. How about this, if you try to leave, I'll kick you in the back!
jake: Easy does it. Easy does it.
amir:  Alright, appetizer time! We're talking pulled pork sliders with a honey dijon glaze.
jake: Red wine coulda worked with that, right?
murph: Yo, you ever taken a picture of your dick next to a slider and told the girl it was a full on burger?
amir: Yeah.
emily: Yes.
jake: What?
murph:  Check it.
jake: Yikes man, a lot smaller than the slider.
murph: Hah, it's like a... pff... wrong picture so it's like that's a triple quarter pounder or er... I'm gonna kick you in the back!
INTRO
murph: You're watching Jake and Amir.
emily: Mmm, that was so hot, babe.
jake: You guys can't hook up in the booth.
amir: They are!
amir: Welcome, hello, bruchim habaim, and bon giorno, to a culinary experience from all around; our globe... Carpe diem! Seize the fish. Heh! No, tonight we're having carp.
murph: Nice.
amir:  Wrickee wrickee-- scratch that. We are having branzino.
emily: Neko's a vegan. She BBM'd me.
amir: Okay, um... uh, she can have the... bed of arugula-- like, I don't know what to do at this point; I'm sorry.
murph: It's okay, but-- hey, Jake, uh, if your date had dietary restrictions, you really should have emailed us ahead of time. That would've been polite.
jake: I--... just met her, so I wouldn't know anything about her dietary restrictions, right?
murph: Well, you just threw him a curveball that he can't hit, and I kind of need tonight to go perfectlyyyyyyyyyy...
jake:  Okay, I saw it, put it away...
jake:  Good save.
amir: Uh... it's fine. It's fine. Neko, um, do you eat beef? Or, do you not, because you're a fucking vegan now, all of a sudden-- I can't-- I'm sorry.
jake: That's not on me, right? ...Buddy? Okay.
murph: Hey, c'mon, c'mon. Easy on the grig', easy on the grig'.
amir:  I just can't believe she fucking did that to me like that. And in the middle of a fucking meal? What kind of timing is that?
murph: I know. It's Jake's fault. It's Jake's fault. He raw-dogged us, he did-- you're blinking a lot--
amir: Yeah, he raw-dogged me, h-- I feel like he bent me over a table and dogged me raw or something. He raw-dogged me! Yeah.
murph: That's exactly what he did. He just took us and he just fuckin' took his dry-ass little dick and he just shoved it in our raw buttholes.
amir: Yeah, and he did it raw! That's the worst part. I feel like if he lubed me up-- okay, fine. That's one thing. Whatever. Moist: it slides right in-- Yeah! Just spit.  Slides right in, slides right out; it doesn't hurt that much. But for him-- for him to raw-dog us like that?
murph:  Alright. Right; spit-- just spit on it. That's all I'm asking. Just spit-- just one. Right. That's fine.
jake: Hey-- you guys know I can hear you, right? This was not my fault--
murph: It was his fault!
amir: It was.
murph: But you're ready for this, okay? You can handle it.
amir: Yeah.
murph: Go!
jake: You know, that's not hot. Your hands probably smell like fish now.
murph:  Whoa ho ho! Nobody touch their dinner until I post this to Pinterest. This is the most pinteresting thing I've seen all week.  Jake, you're gonna re-pin that, right?
jake: I'd have to sign up for an account.
murph: Good, so you'll do that?
jake: Yeah. You know what? When I go home tonight, I'll sign up for an account.
murph: I'd feel much more comfortable if you'd just do it now.
jake:  Not this second, okay?
murph:  Jake, don't fuckin' embarrass me at my house, dude.
jake: It's not gonna let me do it from my phone.
murph: Here.
jake: This is insane, that you're making me do this.
murph: Don't talk to me.
jake: Okay. I'm on Pinterest. Here, just re-pinned it.
emily: Babe, make sure that he pins some other stuff. Otherwise it'll look like a dummy account.
murph: She's right... Fuck it, let's browse!
jake: Fuck what? Dinner? The date?
emily: Babe, make sure that he shows his feminine side but also his masculine pride.
murph: Ya gots to! Yo, that kale smoothie looks dope.
jake: Are we still on a date? Is this even still a date? Because I'd feel like I was missing out if Neko had said anything to me, ever! Neko! ...Neko! Come on.
amir: All right! So, this is a most interesting little dish; it's sort of a palate-cleanser in terms that it's a spinach hazelnut salad with onions, olives, and a citrus balsamic vinaigrette.
amir: I know what you're thinking: Salad in between the meals? Well, we sort of had a... special little customer who needed a special little salad, so here we are.
emily: Neko's allergic to nuts. 
amir: Is she! Okay, Neko, how 'bout this? How 'bout you  eat, around, the, nuts? How 'bout that, Neko? Huh? ...Sorry, it--
murph: Hey hey, focus up, I need your feedback on this pin: pink aztec dress, or cupcake kebabs? I can't pin 'em both.
jake: Why not?
murph: You don't get a say! You don't get a say.
jake: This is my account! These are my pins!
jake: 'Ey-- Weak!
murph: Oh, ho ho! I didn't realize we were poppin' shirts; I was gonna wait until after the gelato, but... you only YOLO once!
jake: We're not popping shirts, and that's not the phrase.
emily:  Let's play spin the bottle.
amir: Hey, I got the bottle!
jake: Hey, I brought that.
amir: I'm doin' you a favor, bro!
murph: Ha ha ha! Nice! Pour it out!

jake: Still be pretty immature then, right? Since you're almost 30?
amir: I don't not appreciate, or the opposite of appreciate that so
jake: Your nose is bleeding.
amir: Oh, dammit. Er, fine, good. Frig it! I'm overthinking it!
jake: Okay, well you know what, if thinking of opposites makes your nose bleed, I'd advise you not to partake in Opposite Day.
amir: No! Er, yes!
jake: Or at least go back to school. Try to make yourself smart.
amir: Okay, you know what? For the rest of the day, I'm not going to ignore you.
jake: Fine. I'm just gonna leave you with one final thought: I have a vagina, you have a penis.

jake: Great, I got that all on camera.
amir: Delete that video you fucking dickwad.
jake: So it's not Opposite Day anymore.
amir: Opposite Day just took a big old timeout when I became concerned about what you're gonna be doing with that footage of me saying
some pretty compromising shit! Namely, that I have a pussy, that I'm a nerd, and that we aren't friends!
jake: That was everything you said.
amir: No. Yes. What?
jake: Right. So definitely I am posting that video online. That's why I took it.
amir: At least say that it's Opposite Day
jake: No.
amir: in the caption!
jake: No!
amir: Good. Fine. Everybody please listen up. Despite what video on the internet you may or may not have seen yet, I am not a nerd and
I do have a pussy.

paul: Dammit he's right! Carry on gentleman.
jake: Are you kidding me?!
amir: You're watching Jake and Amir, but I bet you're just looking at Jake!
jake: Wow, low self esteem.
amir: Yeah!

amir: Hurwitz
jake: No! Use your own name!
amir: Number 10
jake: You sick fuck! Use you own name!
amir: Where and when. Let it be her call, it is 2011 after all
jake: It's actually 2012 and right off the bat first up on your top 10 date ideas is sort of a cop out so you don't have to choose one
amir: Number 9: feeling wine! laughs
jake: Not that good of a joke
amir: Take her to a wine bar; and not a place that's close, go real far; and not in a plane, drive in a car. That's right, go to wine country - Napa Valley, California together.
jake: Great!
jake: So on your first date you want to take a cross-country drive with a stranger and then spend several days in wine country with them? That's like a nine day excursion buddy-
jake: Stop doing that!
amir: Number 8: Take your mother on a date. The first chick you were inside of and you didn't even call her. Now that's baller.
jake: That's disgusting
amir: Lucky number sleven: change your name to Kevin!
jake: Weird. Not a date
amir: Meet her in heaven. That's right a Romeo and Juliet group suicide so you could spend all of eternity together.
jake: Why do you write everything on these scrolls? Like these ancient treasure maps you seem to have?
amir: Six: stands for chicks. That's right, it's the year 2000, so wherever she wants to go you make it happen, Cap'n.
jake: That is the second time you've: 1) gotten the year wrong, and 2) avoided choosing a date spot
amir: High five: smoke a bowl and roll. Wake and bake and make her make you a steak. You're ingesting weed and ecstasy, and guess what day it is... X-mas eve.
jake: Have you done that before?
amir: Yes! Number 4 is a city so nice they named it Rice. Rice, Texas.
jake: Another road trip?
amir: You actually fly in through Dallas! It's a hub!
jake: Fine.
amir: Number 3: will you marry me?
jake: Too much, too fast, way too soon!
amir: I don't need an answer tonight, but I do need a promise in writing that you'll love me forever.
jake: That's more than an answer. That's a contract.
amir: All marriages are arranged, if you include destiny.
jake: I don't
amir: Number 2: Darlin' it's always been you. Please say I do, I have a rabbi a priest and a mosque on standby.
jake: That last one is not a person. By the way, these are all still first date suggestions, right?
amir: Honestly, I'm just trying to get laid.
jake: Bad way
amir: Number 1: you are the one
jake: Okay
amir: I'm down on one knee and this is my plea. You are the prettiest girl that I ever did see. So you ask that Lady: Will you marry me?
amir: Well?
jake: Well what?
amir: Well, thoughts on the list?
jake: Why do you do this? Why do you stay up at night in your apartment making these weird lists? And you know what, even if you get some kind of perverse pleasure out of writing the lists, why bring them to work, and read them to me, when I don't like it?
amir: Great, so a simple yes or no would have sufficed.
jake: It actually wouldn't have sufficed, because you said: Thought's on the list? That's not a yes or no question
amir: And? What are your thoughts on the list?
jake: It's a bad list. It's a bad list and you're a bad person.
amir: Wow! That was scoff unexpected... I honestly thought you loved it.

ben: Push! Push! Amir, you're shitting yourself.
jake: Hi, 911? Yeah I have a dicksucker here in the room with me.
ben: Bullshit!
amir: That's not fair.
jake: Yes I do! And he's operating on my friend, who has food poisoning.
ben: Amir, I got some good news and I got some bad news.
amir: What's the good?
ben: The good news is you're going to die.
amir: Ohhh! What's the bad?
ben: The bad news is I don't know what the term good news means.
amir: Oy vey iz mir!
ben: I'm sorry, ok?
jake: it's not that big of a deal, 911 just says we have to induce vomiting.
ben: There's only one way to do this.
amir  jake: NO! No more milk!
ben: No more milk, we got it guys, so don't be silly stupid or dumb! No more milk
jake: No more milk.
ben: Ok? So shall we just pop it in he...
amir  jake: No!
amir: He said no more milk!
ben: I thought you were doing it to the crowd, to me? To me, the crowd...
jake: Give me the milk!
ben: Ok guys, if I give you the milk you gotta swear to me not to...
amir: Just give him the milk!
ben: Ok fine. I know how to do this, induce vomiting, I can do this. But I need your permission, ok?
amir: Sure.
ben: I'm gonna warn you, it's not by the bewks.
amir: By the what?
ben: Not by the bewks.
amir: It's by the what?
ben: Not by the bewww-ks.
amir: What is it by?
jake: He's trying to say book.
ben: Shut up idiot! OK? I'm gonna take this straw, I need to stick it inside your stomach and I need to suck out the badness, and spit it out to the right. Can I do that?
jake: Yeah, 911 says that's insane, don't do that.
amir: Let's do it!
ben: WE ARE CHAMPIONS!
Ben sticks the straw into Amir's stomach. Everyone screams. Ben starts sucking on the straw.
jake: YEAH, 911, HE STABBED HIM! THE COCKSUCKER STABBED MY
FRIEND AND HE'S SUCKING THE SHIT OUT OF HIS STOMACH!
amir: I cannot even begin to describe how weird this feels.
jake: You know what, you're not doing what you said you were going to do which is spit out his fluids. Ok this is insane, they say to just punch you in the stomach.
ben: Do it!
Jake punches Amir in the stomach. A shoe flies out, and Jake catches it.
jake: A shoe?
amir: That actually makes sense... because literally a second before I started complaining of pain, I ate a shoe.
ben: I saved the day again.
jake: No you didn't, you didn't do anything except give him expired milk and stab him with a straw.
ben: You're welcome.
jake: 911 is the real hero. Hello sir, what is your name? I'd like to thank you personally... Charles what?
Jake, Amir and Ben look across the room to see Ben sitting in a milkman outfit on the other end of Jake's phone.
ben: Charles ken..chew om noms...

INTRO-
amir: Hi, you're watching Jake and Amir, or as my mom calls it, YOU'LL NEVER AMOUNT TO SHIT!
jake: Wow.
amir: MMMMMPH! MMMMPH!
jake: Jesus Christ dude, what happened?
amir:  I had a bad day, I took-a one down, I sang a sad song just to turn it around...
jake: Does this have anything to do with the 319 Emails I got when I got off the subway?
amir: It's kinda hard to be sure, I was too busy being BOUND AND GAGGED FOR THE LAST 20 MINUTES ON ACCOUNT OF ALL THE EMAILS I SENT!
jake: So it's not that hard to be sure, right? First email from you came 49 minutes ago. Anybody want half a bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich? I tried to finish it but could nay get 'er done. I'm full as a kite and I just might stop to eat you out.
amir:... EMAIL OF THE FUCKING YEAR.
jake: Not really. You respond to your email Here ye, here ye, did anybody hear me? This is an amazing deal, get it while she's NOT. Kevin responds I'll eat the sandwich if you shut the fuck up. And you respond to that I'll shut up if literally everybody in the company tells me to... Gangam Style.
amir: Yeah, exactly, it's a Korean pop song.
jake: I know.
amir: And guess what Kevin got in response? A heaping helpful of radio silence.
jake: 211 emails in 30 seconds, which means a bunch of people told you to shut up twice.
amir: They didn't have to tell me twice.
jake: They actually did, because you respond Yeehaw, partners! Didn't realize y'all hated me so much. Owie Zowie. But, not everyone told me to shut up twice, therefore the email thread, unlike Murph's grandmother, lives.
amir: Low blow? HELL NO!
jake: Hell yes. I guess people stopped responding to the thread and started talking to you in person, because your next email says, I've had it up to here with people coming by my desk and being mean to me.
amir: Yeah.
jake: I don't know why you guys have this mob mentality, but you sheep need to learn how to think individually.
amir: BAH, BAA! And guess what happened next... my neck was stapled!
jake: Yep, saw that. Your next email, Who's the coward bitch that stapled my neck? I blinked for a second and I missed you, missed you, now I gotta kissed you. Make yourself known. Rosie responds It was me. and I guess you had to retaliate in some way, because your next email is Who's the prick that threw that brick at my head when I went to hit Rosie? Be a man and fess up to the crime so that I can do the time. Owen Parsons responds It was me. And you reply, 9 minutes later, Who's the loser who tripped me when I went to staple Owen's neck? I tripped and almost hit my head really hard, that would've been a lawsuit for sure.
amir: WORST. DAY. EVER.
jake: Yes, I imagine it was, because you sent out another email.  I was just hit with another fucking brick. Are you shitting me with these? That makes 3 bricks on the gay. I don't know where you guys even got these things or the audacity to hurl them at me at such close range-- are you not full anymore?
amir: Yeah.
jake: Why are you still typing these emails?
amir: I wanted to diffuse the situation!
jake: You think this is diffusing the situation? Y'all are gonna have to bind and gag me if you want peace and quiet around here. And good luck, because I'm got going quietly. Your last email, sent 30 seconds before I got here, is obviously typed with your face, it's just MMPHUSFISDMPH. And then somehow, in perfect english, Gangam style.
amir: That's my email signature!}
josh: Why did you ungag him?!
jake: C'mon dude, hasn't he suffered enough?
amir: Oh, he got me again! The prick hit me again! Did ya see that, with the stapler?!
jake: Ok, they're throwing bricks.
amir: Get out of here, save yourself, I can take it!  Ooh, hit me square!

amir: Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir, and you're right, I am a loser.

EPISODE
amir: Oh, yellow, colonel mustard.  Yellow, colonel mustard.  Hello, turtle mushroom.
jake: Take off your costume.
amir: I'll take that as a condiment.
jake: Please don't. I saw you come in here as a pirate.
amir: Nyarr! 'Twas a fine costume indeed. However...
jake: However, you saw that I was in a mustard costume, panicked, then sprinted out of work. You came back two hours later in this.
amir: Coincedence? I think nyarr!
jake: I think nyarr as well. Where did you even find that costume on such short notice?
vincent: Help! A fucking pirate did this to me!
amir: It happened by chance. Happenstance. It happens, Nance!
jake: Right, can you please not talk in limericks?
amir: Oh, really, that's a limerick? Because last time I checked limericks were an AABBA rhyme scheme.
jake: Did you call on a bomb threat to my little brother's school?
amir: Exqueese me!
jake: Don't say exqueese me.
amir: Ex- No, yes, exqueese me.
jake: I'm saying, don't say exqueese me anymore, OK?
amir: I'm saying exqueese me.
jake: Yeah, and I'm saying if you don't understand something I said, say excuse me-
amir: Ex-
jake: or what.
amir: Exqueese me.
jake: The other night, his entire dorm was evacuated at one AM because somebody called in a bomb threat, and as he's filing out, he got a text message, from you, that said It's me, it's fine.
amir:  First of all, that's a lie, second of all, I was doing it to triple-check the safety of the school, it's not like your parents were gonna do shit about it.
jake: You know what? Don't take matters like that into your own hands.
amir: Fine, no more bomb threats, Adolf.
jake: Can you take off that costume? OK? I don't want people to think we coordinated this.
amir:  You know, in some weird, fucked up, twisted way, I'd actually be happy if people thought that.
jake: I know.
amir: No, I'm serious.  In my messed up mind, like I can delude myself into thinking that you called me in a mustard costume and asked me to wear this.
jake: Yeah, I mean, I guess so.
amir: Actually, if you want to know the whole truth, I saw a doctor this weekend, a psychotherapist specializing in manic depression and acute schizophrenia, and, uh, he I guess diagnosed me, for lack of a better term, with having these delusions of grandeur and, uh, made it quite abundantly clear to me that, without medication, that you just got punked, bitch! Ha, ha ha, these costumes were a coincidence!
jake: Come on, dude! We just turned a corner!
vampire: Bleh! I vont to suck your blood!
All laugh
vampire: But, seriously, there's a, uh, bomb threat, and we have to evacuate, like, now.

jake: Yes.
amir: So I'm dropping off this piece of ham.
jake: That piece of ham is an example of a perishable food and I asked you to bring non-perishable food.
amir: It's the least I can do!
jake: It's the least amount of food you could bring.
amir: That's not true, I could've eaten more, brought less.
jake: You ate some of the ham!?
amir: What about all these water bottles, are you giving people shit about bringing that?
jake: No, because people need water!
amir: No, because you hate me!
jake: Oh my god, you're selfish.
amir: Actually, little known fact, it was water that caused all the damage to begin with.
jake: That's a well-known fact.
amir: If you don't accept this ham, I'm going to have no choice but to, to, to throw it away.
jake: Great, I don't accept the ham.
amir: What?! I'm not going to just toss it.
jake: You're kidding me. You're crying right now?
amir: I'm crying!
jake: You're beefing?

amir: No... I've n...I didn't say that.
jake: Just like feel negative about-
amir: Yeah, I just feel like the tables are turning not in my favour...
jake: That's not really an expression...
amir: What? The tables are turning? Yes it is..
jake: No the shame on.. You should have brought spam. The joke would still have worked, it would've been a non-perishable food. 'We goin' spam'.
amir:  Woah.
girl: Jake! That's poor taste!
amir: Bad joke, No. Bad you!
jake: Okay, I'll tell you what, I'll give you five dollars to leave before you go give it back to me and I'll donate it in your name okay?
amir: Okay, how about this? I will give you one dollar back, keeping the four as a go fuck yourself fee for making me feel like shit for donating water and ham!
jake: When did you donate water?
Amir spits in Jake's face
jake: You piece of shi-
jake: Hey guys, thank you very much for watching our video. I know we made a lot of jokes but you can actually help by going to redcross.org - don't touch me. - donate online or if you live in the tri-state area, you can donate your canned goods, water and batteries.
amir: Now, I know what you're thinking, why donate? Good question, you don't have to.
jake: Nobody's thinking that! You piece of shit!
amir:  Well I'm just saying, show both sides of the argument!
jake: Oh My God!
jake: Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir.

Speaking of 'N Sync,  it's gotta be me.
amir: Fuck this room

amir: Ohmygod, ohmygod, change the channel,  I can't even look, I can't handle the pressure!
jake: It's a commercial.
amir: I know, but I don't know which one gets out the most stains.  Is it Tide?  Please don't tell me, don't tell me.  Is it Tide, though?
jake: Yeah, dude, it's Tide.  It's not the other leading detergents.

amir: That is way too recent, that's not trivia.
kelly: Who won the Super Bowl in 1989?
amir: I don't have to play this game with you anymore, cuz you're clearly cheating, the Jacksonville Jaguars.
kelly: They weren't a team until 1995.
amir: Alright, you know what, lightning round, first one to touch the coffee table wins.   Ooooooooo!

Spending a lot of time by the window of my apartment with a weird combination of binocs, a telescope and some mirrors.  Heh heh.  Just getting drunk on Riesling, sitting on a stool, with a bottle of Viagra in one hand and a bottle of Jergens in the other, just waiting for something  romantic  to happen. Heh.  Some nights when nothing pans out, I'll just wait and wait and wait for a husband to come home and kiss his wife on the cheek and that's enough, i'm like, fuck it, I'm going at it.  I tie a belt around my neck and I'm just fucking strangling msyelf-
vince: H-hey hey hey, look they- they're going for it on the 4th down.

amir: Anyone want a sausage or something, like a bratwurst?
vince: Yeah, sure.
amir: Cool, go make it yourself, then.
vince: I said yes cuz I- I thought you were gonna be making it-
amir: No, I know, but why don't you go get it yourself?  If you want something, why don't you go get it?  Huh?
amir: It's called the art of being active.  If you want something-
jake: Okay, we get it, thank you.  Stop it.  Settle down.  Shut up.
kelly: Shut up.
vince: You don't understand the way things work!!

INTRO
amir: Hey, you're watching me and Amir.
jake: What the fuck was that?
jake: You guys know what today is.
amir: Erection day, so cast your bone, it's not that hard-on.
jake: Leave.
amir: Because I made a joke?!
jake: Because you made three jokes, and they were all about dicks. Okay, it was offensive.
amir: You know, in some states, the presidential race is a foregone conclusion, so New York and Alabama, thanks but no thanks, you don't need to vote.
jake: What if everybody thought like that?
amir: Then I'd be a genius. Okay, convincing an entire state not to vote? I should be president.
jake: A president wouldn't do that.  Oh, worst face you've ever made.
amir: Barack Obama? More like Yitzchak Osama. Okay, that guy's a Jew and an Arab and you mean to tell me religion has no part in this election?  Where are you going? Afraid of the truth?
amir: Mitten Romney? I'm smitten, Homney.
jake: That's not good, man, homney's not a word.
amir: And Paul Ryan, we are tryin', but nobody's Biden their time quite like our vice president, Joseph Dan Quayle.
jake: You're not smart.
amir: Never said I was.
amir: Okay, I know it's a two-party system, but what about the candidate nobody's talking about, Mitt Romney.
jake: People are talking about Mitt Romney. You were just talking about Mitt Romney.
amir: When?
jake: Remember Smitten Homney?
amir: Oh, yeah that was funny.
jake: It was not funny.
jake: Okay, we know you're busy, but you gotta find-
amir: Voting isn't hip, but you know what is? A rap, so give me a beat.  Politics is a polish-dick so cast your vote on this pink 
jake: Stop, stop!
amir: Censorer! I sense you're a censorer, sir, who censored my words, so rest assured I'm incensed, for sure!
jake: No more slam poetry. Okay, that was really good but no more slap poetry.
amir: Thank you.
jake: You gotta be as well-informed as possible, so research your candidates before you head to the polls.
amir: Exactly right, so, for example, Barack Hossein Osama, wow, yeah, he stands for socialism, and Mitt Mone-y, ha ha, he stands... for socialism.
jake: So get out there and cast your vote for your candidate todate- today. Today-
amir: Oh my God, let me bail you out, brother, so get out there and vote for your favorite candidate today. Huh.
jake: Perfect.

jake: It's fine if you were blinking.
amir: So, get out there and vote for your favorite candiday-diday. Ahh-bululah. So get out there and vote for your favorite candidate di-  It is harder than it sounded. Three, two one.

amir: Get your VDD Di- Oh my God, I'm thinking about something else.
amir: Ahhhh! It's like a ffffff- I'm pissed off now! Candiday-di-  Whoo!
amir: So get out there and vote for your candiday-diday!
jake: You know, you weren't blinking before, and now you just did one with your eyes completely closed.
amir: I think both of them work. Okay, ready? Three, two, one. Get out there and vote. Blululehh. Let me take it slow and we can speed it up.
jake: Even if you were blinking before, that's fine.
amir:  So get out there and vote for your favorite candiday-diday.
jake: Alright, let's try one m-
amir: Don't! I said I needed two minutes.
jake: And you've been standing there for, like, seven!
amir: Candidate. Not even closer.
amir:  Get out there and vote for your favorite candiday-diday, favorite candiday-diday, favorite candiday-diday, oh my God.  Favorite candidate-to date.
jake: Candidate.
amir: Candidididay.
jake: Don't say today, it's messing you up, okay, candidate.
amir: Candidididay.
jake:  Come on.
amir: Oh!
jake: I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
amir: That's okay. Yeah, yeah, I needed that.
jake: Candidate.
amir: I feel like I got it now. Get out there and vote for your favorite candidaydiday. When you hit me, something messed me up, man.
jake: Alright, so if you're over the age of 18-
amir: Oh, I'm in college, I didn't register, I can't vote. Wrong!
jake: You know, if they didn't register then you actually can't vote.
amir:  That sounds like Tea Party philosophy to me. 
jake: That was hot tea!

jake: Oh my god get out
jake: Well this was supposed to be an intervention, but i guess no one like you enough to show up.
amir: Oh
jake: Don't act smug, I know that hurt.
amir: Is it something I said, or did?
jake: I mean both. You've been rubbing everyone the wrong way for the past four or five years.
amir: Yeah, that explains why everybody's been acting coy to me since 2003
jake: Not coy, it's not coy, they hate you
doobs: Is he dead yet, or is it not that kind of intervention
jake: What kind of interventions do you go to?
doobs: 
amir: What are you doing here, Doobs?
doobs: I RSVP'd to this intervention one year ago today, on E-vite
jake: Impossible, I didn't have an E-vite for this intervention, I just decided to have it last week.
amir: So quiet up, Huddy!
doobs: You can't call me that any more, A-Weird.
amir: No!
doobs: Yes! Because of three seconds ago I have litterally changed my name yet again to Penis Dickling, The Goose! 
jake: That's not a goose noise
amir: Now how am I to make fun of him?
jake: I don't know, Penis is still pretty bad, I mean dickling is awful
amir: Mr Goose
doobs: Grrr, Curse you!
jake: That's the nicest thing he could have called you.
doobs: Never matter, we're not here to discuss myself, or the millions of films I've now been cast in. We're here to talk about A-Weird and his father, and his father's tiny, spindly, sticky little legs.
jake: Wait a second, films?
doobs: Oh you haven't heard? I am now officially, and universally, a famous actress
amir: whoah, short shorts
jake: You know I really hope you just misspoke.
doobs: I didn't. I've been casted as the fem fatal in the brilliant film A bridge over river Queer. Yes, you heard that. How do you like that range, even Thomas Hanks hasn't played a woman, and he's a MTV award nominee!
jake: Okay, I don't think you're right about either of those things.
amir: Yes he is!
jake: No he's not!
amir: Yes he is!
doobs: No, I'm not. Tell me, do you have a CD-ROM drive?

doobs: Okay, and these?
jake: Books
doobs: Well then wheres you're CD-ROM drive?

EPISODE
amir: Happy Post-Turkey Day, eveyone! Who wants 5 liters of piping-hot split pea soup? Or, should I say, shit pee poop? *laughs* No, I'm just jok-oh no! Ah! *falls over, pours soup on face* ARGH! FUCK, IT'S BOILING!
jake: O-oh my god!
amir: AH, IT'S BOILING MY FACE AND NECK! AAH, IT'S SO HOT! AAH!
jake: Hey, alright, I'm going to call 9-1-1, okay?
amir: No, it's not going to do anything! I prank call them all the time!
jake: I'll call it from my phone.
amir: I do it from your phone!
jake: Well, I'll just tell them you legitimately burned your face this time!
amir: I crank-yanked them last night with that exact line! I said, please come, I legitimately burned my face this time! They show up, there's a flaming pile of dog shit on my own apartment stoop. Got 'em good.
jake: ..did you?
amir: Nah, not really. They just left and a huge part of my apartment burned down. Can you do me a favor?
jake: What?
amir: I'd like to stay with you in order to recoup from this injury. I need you to be my nurse for a week.
jake: ...no.
amir: What? You already said yes! How could you take it back now?
jake: No, I didn't. I said what.
amir: Yeah, what is yes! Why would you want to know what the favor is unless you were going to do it?
jake: To see if I wanted to agree to the favor!
amir: No! Hell no!
jake: Don't tell me what I mean.
amir: This is unreal! This was your soup!
jake: What are you talking about?
amir: I made this soup for you, right? I called you last night and I said, if I brought in leftover split pea soup, would you have some?
jake: And I said no!
amir: Exactly! And then I said, if you're not going to have it, then I'm just not going to bring any in, and you said fine.
jake: Yeah, fine as in don't bring in the soup.
amir: No, fine as in yes!
jake: Stop telling me what I mean by shit!
amir: Are you actually yelling at me right now? I feel like I'm being burnt alive in a cauldron, or a bowl of hot soup was dumped on my face.
jake: Have you already forgotten that that is what happened?
amir: *sigh* I'm starting to regret this whole plan.
jake: What plan, man?
amir: I figured if I scalded myself on my most important organ,  my face...
jake: Wrong.
amir: For most people it's heart, for me, it's face.
jake: You're wrong. Go on.
amir: I figured if I doused myself in hot soup, you'd want to bring me in. Show me some tender love and care, y'know? Maybe rent some DVDs from Blockbuster Media. I would even eat some leftover yams that you would offer me. I don't really like yams, but I wouldn't have the heart to tell you.
jake: Well, I'm well aware that you hate yams.
amir: I hate 'em. I hate yams!
jake: Stop saying yams.
amir: ....YAMS.
jake: Look, if you really did this just to recover at my house, if you're that pathetic, lowly, and masochistic, then...y'know what? I almost do feel bad enough to have you...
amir: No, no, I don't want to do it like this. I don't want that pity invite!
jake: What are you talking about? Yes you do! You poured the soup on your face!
amir: This isn't about me.
jake: Yes, it is! Everything's about you! You're the most selfish person I know!
amir: That is not fair.
jake: Unfair? You prank called 9-1-1! You took emergency responders away from people who actually need it!
amir: Okay, y'know what? I accept the pity offer. You've made me feel like shit, and so I will accept the pity offer, but I will NOT eat the yams.
jake: Oh, you'll eat the yams.
amir: I will not eat the yams, Amir!
jake: I'M Jake, YOU'RE Amir.
amir: ...YAMS.
jake: *starts strangling Amir*
amir: Aah, god, this isn't part of the yam plan! Yam plan, thank ya ma'am!
INTRO
jake: Hey ladies, you're watching Jake  Amir.
amir: Very cool.
jake: Shut up, dude.
jake: Hey asshole!
amir: Are you mad at me?
jake:  Are you sad-der me.
amir: That's not what I said.
jake: Dude, these cords? Your fault. My pants are too tight, and that ain't right.
amir: I agree. Look, I'm sorry I couldn't respond to your text messages as to whether or not you should buy those pants, but I was with my mom.
jake: Oh, I can't wait to hear this story.  I'm all beers.
amir: My mom was in a car accident and so my entire family was with her in the hospital.
jake: Are you done being a jackass?
amir: Look, I'm sorry, I don't know what else to say.
jake: No, no, I'm sorry. Jesus. I'm sorry.
amir: Thank you.
jake: What a tragedy.
amir: Yeah, it's just so weird to see this -
jake: Yeah, no, I can't believe a modern hospital wouldn't have cell phone service. I - I - I - I - I - I'm appalled.
amir: Huh? No, it had cell phone service.
jake: Oh, it HAD cell phone service.  But you didn't respond to my text, so, your lies are catching up with you, Blumenfeld.  Hmm, I don't know.
amir: No, I had cell phone reception, I jus-
jake: How you gonna play this one, bud?
amir: I just couldn't respond, okay, because I was-
jake: Cuz you were busy operating on her?  Cuz you're a PA or some shit? Are you a physician's assistant?  Or were you in the waiting room with your dick in your hand?
amir: I was in the waiting room, yes.
jake: Then you had your dick in your hand, didn't you?
amir: No, I didn't have my dick in my -
jake: You were jerkin' your gerkin in the waiting room.
amir: No, I was not.
jake: I bet a doctor would frown upon that.  I do.
amir: I was on my phone, okay? I was starting this phone tree, you know, trying to alert every member of my family as to what happened.
jake: You have got to be SHITTING me with that, dude!  You were on your phone? You were on your phone??  And you were ignoring my texts as they're coming in??  By the way, a phone tree works like this: You call one person, then that person calls another person and then that person calls another person.  Doesn't mean, like, everybody's calling you, making it so you can't respond to your texts, right?  It's some kind of reverse phone tree?  Were you the trunk?  If you're the trunk, then you got punked.
amir: I don't know what to say.  I guess I got punked.  It's just that I'm also in emotional pain, too, right now, man.
jake:  Don't play that card, you coward.  Okay, I sent you 12 pictures of myself in a dressing room, and it would've taken 3 seconds out of your day to give me a hell to the no. You know, even, going forward, how about if you ignore my texts, I'll know, don't buy the cords.
amir: Fine, I ignored the text.
jake:  Going forward, I said.  As in starting now, and seeing as though I texted you yesterday, Lucy! You got some 'splaining to do!   If anybody heard that and didn't laugh, I urge you to reconsider.  Okay, I would take a pity laugh to save some face.  Speaking of face, why is nobody sucking on my face as I am looking amazing in these ill-fitting - slim-fitting! - cords?
amir: I thought you said you didn't like the pants.
jake: You thought wrong.  A pair of roys for this lazy goy make the Jewish sluts say oy oy oy.
amir: Offensive.
jake: I butt-fucked my brother, on a booze cruise!
amir: Can't you just return the corduroys?
jake: Of course I could. It's not exactly how I went to spend my Sunday afternoon, right, bud?
amir:  The hospital's calling me.
jake: And once again, you choose them over me.
amir: I haven't picked it up yet.
jake: Yeah, but I know you're thinking about it, dude.  And tell you what, if you pick that up,  me and you are done professionally.   Another joke for everybody, that's Christian Ball ,  but really? Pick it up, and we're not friends.
amir: Fine.  Hey, can I call you back? 
jake: Oh - oh oh oh oh oh oh yeah, that doesn't matter at all.  You still picked it up!
amir: I hung up on them!
jake: You c- you certainly did not.  You left this conversation, you had another one! Ok?  How do you think that makes me feel?
amir: I told them I'd call them back!
jake: You s- you uh ew ah - please! You answered the phone, you said  Hi, how are you? I'm Amir Blumenfeld, I'm a piece of shit.
amir: No!
jake: Then you said,  can I please call you back? Let me please call you back?  I bet you do call them back, too!
amir: Yeah, I might.  Probably, yes.
jake: Alright, man, alright, we have to figure this shit out, ok? I'm sorry your mom's dead, but that's not -
amir:  She's not dead.
jake: You gotta be SHITTING me with that!

amir: Hey, you're watching Jake and a BEARD
jake: Nice.
amir: Well, your beard's not nice.
jake: Stop!
episode:
amir: Wha? You've gotta be shitting me with this.
jake: Sorry man....
amir: This is not how I wanted to start my day.
jake: Then you know what? You shouldn't have brought your rabid Rottweiler to Bring Your Dog To Work Day.
amir: So the bitch barked a bit!
jake: What are you talking about, She barked a bit? She killed two dogs! She ate two other dogs and bit a bunch of people.
amir: And for that, I deserve this, this... silent treatment?
jake: Why do you think that everything that happens to you is the silent treatment?
amir: Silence.
jake: No one is giving you the silent treatment. They just made and destroyed this You-Doll.
amir: I'm starting to think that I shouldn't have even brought Rotem in to work!
jake: Who the fuck is Rotem?
amir: That's the name of the pup!
jake: You know what? Stop calling her a pup. You brought a crazed beat into the office. She attacked you, making you drop her leash.  You looked surprised and scared and you said, You know what,  'I can't deal with this' and then you ran off in a brazen act of cowardice.
amir: I feared her that day....
jake: You should fear her everyday, and I think you do because you locked yourself in a closet for two hours yelling, Shoot 'er! Shoot 'er! Shoot the bitch for all I care!' Meanwhile, she's out there attacking people, almost as if you trained her to do it. I mean, where did you get such an angry animal?
amir: She is an angry bitch. But she is calm.
jake: Wrong. You know the worst part, man? What animal control got there and told you that you had to put her down, you said, 'go ahead'. You didn't even go with them to the shelter to give her the  needle!
amir: I couldn't....
jake: You couldn't be there for that dog?
amir: I couldn't....
jake: Don't say, 'I couldn't' like you care, like you care about the dog. No, you just brought her to create chaos.
amir: I got the mut three weeks ago at a friggin bake sale! Yea, how do you like that? I'm sitting there trying to gank a muffin and quesant.
jake: Stop saying it like that.
amir: What, quesant?
jake: Yea,  you're not French!
amir: It's a French word!
jake: Just go on with the story.
amir: So I'm tryna gank a quesant and steal an empanada-
jake: Oh my god...
amir: -When all of a sudden I'm attacked by this, by this, by this-
jake: Spit it out
amir: -This beast outta hell. She starts gnawing at my ankle and biting on my thigh meat and I thought, I have to have her. I said, Look, no ones gonna love you, including me.
jake: Jesus.
amir: I had her in my basement for a fortenight

int: Office
jake: Dude, you see Homeland last night?
amir: No! And don't say anything, okay?
jake: I'm not going to say anything. I won't ruin it. It's insane.
amir: That's a spoiler!
jake: That's a spoiler? That's a spoiler?
amir:  Yes! That's a spoiler. To say, that's insane it spoils the experience.
jake: Something insane happens every single week!
amir: I know, but now I feel like someone's going to die or something.
jake: Maybe- Someone dies a lot.
amir: Oh my god!
jake: I'm not saying they did. I'm not saying they did. I'm not saying they did. Maybe they didn't.
amir: That sandwich looks really good, actually.
jake: I know.
amir: Give Daddy a bite.
amir: What?
amir: You're going?
jake: No. I'm..
amir: What did I do?
jake: I don't like what just happened.
amir:  What? I asked you for a bite of your sandwich? Oh no, I asked you for a bite!
jake:  Okay? I'm serious. No, it wasn't just that. You said, Can I have a bite, Daddy? You called yourself Daddy.
amir: Yeah, daddy. It's a joke. It's a joking nickname.
jake: No, it's not a joke. It makes me feel uncomfortable.
amir: On my god. You are reading so much into it.
jake:  I'm not- Look, don't worry. We don't have to have this conservation. I'm just saying.
amir:  Okay. Can I have a bite, bro? Can I have a bite, cuz? Can I have a bite, aunt? Can I have a bite, uncle? Can I have a bite, nephew?
jake: Yeah, no. All of those are examples of things that are unacceptable, actually.
amir: UNACCEPTABLE?! To say bro? Are you kidding me? Everyone calls each other that!
jake: Fine. Bro may be the one that works. But calling yourself my aunt?
jake:  Stop. It doesn't. I don't need a list. All I'm saying. It doesn't have to be. Don't make it a thing. Don't make it a thing. Why are you getting so angry? Why are you harping on it like this? I'm just asking you not to call yourself daddy.
amir:  Bro is fine, okay. So we're on the same generational level. So why don't I give you a list? I'll give you a family tree and you give me a pre-approved list of what I can call you and what I cannot. Daddy: X. Mommy: X. Bro: Okay, that's fine. Cuz: That's fine. So everything on my generational level is fine.
amir: I'm angry? You're about to leave!
jake: Yeah, I'm gonna leave. You made me uncomfortable. You made it weird.
amir: Because it s- it was not even sexual.
jake:  Wow. Really? Right now you're gonna say- Oh God. Dude, I didn't think it was. Don't make it a sexual thing.
amir:  I guess now it grosses you out because you think it's a sexual thing.  Give Daddy a bite. Give Daddy a bite. I wasn't even saying it like-
jake: You saying that makes it kind of a sexual thing.
amir:  What? Because I'm saying it's not a thing makes it a thing? Okay. So, this is not a computer. I guess that makes it a computer. Is that how it works?
jake:  No, I'm not trying to put that on you. Oh my God. Just...Drop it. Just drop it.
jake: Why don't you just drop it?
amir:  I want to drop it but you're turning this into a bigger deal than it already is!
jake:  You're harping on it!
jake: Oh my God.
amir: What?
jake: Look at the veins in your neck coming out right now.
amir:  Oh my God. Veins in my neck. Ooo. Wow. They're gay too. I guess you're freaked out by them because they're calling you daddy.
jake:  You always get so stressed out. Just- Dude, just let it go.
jake: You said something that offended me and I'm gonna leave. That's it.
amir: So you're going to leave?
jake: Yes, I'm going to leave
amir:  You're just going to take off for the rest of the day because I called you a nickname? How's that going to work?  Oh sorry, I'm going to work from home today. Yeah. Amir called me a thing. I guess I'm freaked out and I don't want to be here anymore. If that freaks you out. If that little amount of stuff freaks you out then maybe you shouldn't be here maybe you shouldn't be at work. Because in this environment people call each other nicknames all the time!
jake:  Yes. I think I'm going to go home. I'll work-I'll work from home. I'll email everyone and say I'm working from home. Not a thing, you called yourself daddy. Shut up dude. Yeah! Maybe I will leave! I'm going to leave. You know what I'm going to do-
jake: With the yelling, you can stop it right now. I'm going to go home. I've lost my appetite. You don't get the sandwich. I'm gonna throw it away. Where is it?
amir:  I got it.
jake: How?
amir:  I guess Daddy wins!
jake: You're not even chewing it.
THE END
EPISODE LINK
jake: Hey! Happy new year! You're watching Jake and Amir.
amir: 2011 y'all!
jake: No.
jake: Hey can you not fall asleep right now? We need to talk about that disgusting habit that you've picked up.
amir: It's called butt chugging, and last time I checked, it wasn't disgusting.
jake: Really? Have you checked recently? Because according to the news story that I saw, it involves sticking a funnel inside your asshole, and ingesting alcohol through your colon.
amir : Top ten wines to butt chug!
jake : Where do you go scroll shopping? Did you raid an ancient pirate ship or something?
amir: By Amir  Blumenfeld.
jake: How about you never say that again in the office.
amir : Number ten! I'll say it again. If the taste is heinous, shove it up your anus! you'll get drunk better, faster, stronger.
jake: That is what you did last night at my new year's party, but do you think you were drunker better than anybody? because I think you should up blackout drunk at seven P.M., in half a tuxedo, just the top half, you were naked waist down. You had a glass champagne flute stuck inside your butt, and you were dancing around singing "happy new queer".
amir: Number nine, that's wine and dine! A Chardonnay and a fish fillet, blend it up, dinner and a drink, now that won't stink.
jake: You're talking about shoving blended fish inside your butt, then yeah I bet it does.
amir: To each, her own.
Number eight, it must be fate. A Zinfandel for this infidel make me think, don't ask, do tell. I stick a funnel in my butt.
jake: We all know what you do, ok? You ruined New Year's. When everybody was counting down you bent over and farted Vodka onto the TV.
amir: I'm the life and death, of every party.
jake: Yeah you definitely killed the mood when you slipped and fell and shattered that glass Champagne flute inside your body. We took you to the hospital but the doctor refused to operate on you. He said, in the long run it might be better if you just die.
amir: Number seven, is Levant. That's right, I soak a full body bread in a Jewish rye bread, and this ass, gets fed. Aka, you freeze the loaf and chisel off little suppositories that you stick inside your ass all night like little Tic-Tacs.
jake: Is that what you do with Tic-Tacs?
amir: Yeah!
jake: Why?
amir: Number six, it's for dicks! Take a Capri-Sun straw and stick it in your urethra. With a reverse piss, you can't miss.
jake: So you graduated to dick chugging?
amir: With honors, sir.
amir: Number five, P. nomwar? More like p. yes. - Lar.
jake: Woah.
amir: Woah
jake: Bad.
amir : Oh.
jake: Terrible rhyme.
amir: No?
jake: How did that make your final draft?
amir: It didn't.
jake: This isn't a final? Why are you reading it in front of me?
amir: Number four. One Tequila, two Tequila, three Tequila, sore. Ow, if your anus ain't bruised all night, then you ain't funnelin' right.
jake: Is there a right way to funnel? If there is, I bet you don't know it. 'Cause why else do you have those shards of glass inside your anal cavity right now?
amir: Number three, you and me. Sippin' on some English tea.
jake: So not butt chugging.
amir: Oh, no, no, no. We're sipping it through our assholes.
jake: Definitely not doing that with you.
amir: Number two, how about some Yoo-hoo where you poo-poo. That's right, it's already wet and brown downtown, mamma mia, that's some diarrhea!
jake: I think what I'm gonna do is e-mail Paul...
amir: No.
jake: ...and ugh, see if I have the permission to send you home, or if he will. Um, you need to not be here today.
amir: How is that your call to make?
jake: I'm gonna tell him the circumstances and see if I can send you home.
amir: That's so illogical to me.
jake: Really?
amir: Yeah.
jake: That's illogical? 'Cause I think getting your anus wounds untreated, leaving the hospital saying: "Fuck this quack, you're a hack", I think that's illogical.
amir: Not fair.
jake: That's not fair? What you're doing to your body isn't fair.
amir: I'm almost done with the list.
jake: Three of your top ten haven't even been alcohol. One of them involved shoving a straw inside your dick. I mean that's self-mutilation bud, and I think all of them will kill you.
amir: Number one, have some fun in the sun hun. Bring your ass to the beach, and flop it down like a leech. Put your knees by your ears, but don't feed your butt beers. Not Vodka nor Gin, no those can't go in. Spread your butt cheeks wide, stick that funnel inside, now wait for the tide you're going for a ride. You're a full grown guy, with a tight brown eye, so make sure your lips are sealed, and your rectum is peeled. Which alcohol is best, for your asshole that stretch? Not red nor white, nor Captain Morgan's Delight, no. What will save the day? Oh you don't say? it's: drum roll please.
jake: No.
amir: A simple Rose.
amir: Thank you.
jake: I don't mean it. Are you done with the list?
amir: Not 'till I celebrate, , with a number nine.
jake: Please not now, not here at the office.
.
jake: Oh no! Ah!
amir : Ah! It's in me.

amir: Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir, unless you're my parents in which case, you're NEVER watching it.
jake: Wow.
amir: Yeah
jake: Okay, guys, Texas Hold 'Em is the name of the game.  You know the rules, there are two blinds-
streeter: Amir is standing right behind you.
jake: Buddy, I told you you could go home.  It's a half day, you do NOT need to be here.
amir: I like that you called me a buddy.
jake: I cannot believe you write that down.
amir: What are we playing?
jake: You're leaving.
amir: Nooo, you can't physically force me to leave, so let's figure something out.
jake: I probably COULD physically force you to leave.
amir: Ahh, please don't!
jake: Okay, look, you could stay, under two conditions.
amir: Fine.
jake: Let me say what the conditions are and you might be so insulted, that you decide to leave.
amir: Doubtful.
jake: You can't talk.
amir: Fine.
jake: No speaking...
amir: Good.
jake: ...laughing, doing anything to disrupt us, and you're not allowed to uh, play.
amir:  Oh no, I can't play.  Ah ha ha, yeah, I just wanna be here next to you.  That's fine.
stella: So sad.
guy: Jake, can we just play?
jake: Yeah, sorry,
amir: Wait, before you guys start...
jake: So you're talking right off the bat.
amir: It's a question.  I wanna ask a question.
jake: Did you talk it? Because I said no talking.
amir: You mean did you speak it.  You can't talk it, you don't say did can talk it, you moron.
jake: You're a moron.
amir: Does anyone want sandwiches?  There.  That's my question.  God forbid I ask it!
guy: I'll take a sandwich.
stella: Yeah.
streeter: Sure, I'll take one.
amir: Oh what a surprise, Streeter wants a sandwich.  Oh wait, that's not a surprise.  The way he's bigger than anyone else is that he eats sandwiches more frequently than the average person.
s: Come on!
amir: Ten dollars, everybody give me ten dollars.
jake: So you're not buying them.
amir: I'm BUYING them.  I just don't want to PAY FOR THEM, you grammar Nazi.  Who here thinks I'm right?
jake: Why?
amir: I like word play.  I've always been the kind of girl who's been like Hmmm, I don't know, CAN you go to the bathroom? Heh.
amir: I like this one.  Her skin's a little greasy and her eyebrows are WAY too thick, but she's fun, and I think she likes me, too.
jake: Okay, you were just narrating that entire thing.
amir: It was then that I realized I was narrating along the entire time.  Did the grease princess hear what I had to say about her eyebrows.  We may never know?
stella: Yeah, I did.
amir: My mind was racing.
jake: Okay, let's just play.  Uh, Stella, you're small blinds.  Streeter, you're big.
amir: Yes, he is very big.
jake: You know what dude, that's enough, you can go home.  Cuz  I said no talking, and if anything, you're talking more than you usually do.  You seem incapable of even having an internal monologue.
amir: Okay, give me one more chance!  Give me one more chance!  If I make one joke that makes everybody here crack the fuck up, then I get to stay and play.
jake: Why would I agree to that?
amir: Because if I don't, if my joke falls flat, then I will leave you alone for the rest of your life.
jake:  Wow.  Sure, yeah.  I'll take that.  Go ahead.
amir:  When there's something gay in your neighborhood, who you gonna call?  Nutbusters!
streeter:  You're the king!
jake: My milkshake brings all the gays to the yard, and they're like I'm gayer than y'all, ye-
stella: Horrible.
streeter: I have a gay cousin.
jake: I'm sorry!

amir: No, you gotta go like that;  you didn't k--
amir: We're in trouble, Ace! Earth's closest planet, the moon, needs us.
jake: Dude, were you really just taping me right now?
amir: I'm always taping you, Ace! I'm always taping you.
jake: Okay-- well, I-- you know what? Give me the camera, alright? 'Cuz I  need to-- erase that-- footage...
amir:  No! Get off of me! What are you doing? Oh, your hands smell like Vaseline!
amir: The city looks so calm... but it's in trouble, Ace.
jake: I thought you said the moon was in trouble.
amir: Will you just play along? Okay? You already did the dance, y--
jake: Jocelyn! If--
amir: Yeah!
jake: --If I go on this space mission with you, if we can save the city, then...  you promise you'll let me... delete the footage of me touching my idea... stick, right? To get the enemy intelligence!
amir: It's too obvious! It's too obvious.
jake: All right, Jocelyn. What's the plan?
amir: The plan is there's a nuclear reactor down by the river. I say we go down there, and try to defuse it!
jake: Great idea, but... pretty cold down there. You sure the reactor's not indoors somewhere?
amir: It's not indoors! It's outdoors. Okay? Stick to the script, and you will go there in a T-shirt for this insubordination!
jake: Dude, relax!
amir: Unless you want me to leak the footage of you jer--
jake: Here we are at the river, and, uh... fortunately, there's no nuclear reactor, so I guess we should, uh...
amir: No no no, it's probably... at the bottom of the river. You should go in and check it out.
jake: Aaah, no. Dammit, we're... we're foiled, 'cuz... the river is too... frigid, and... polluted and filthy to... to go in...
amir: Well clearly you don't have a problem being filthy! Right? I have footage on here that shows you not having a problem being filthy, and I can go back upstairs and friggin' upload it!
jake: You know what? You know what, dude? That's it. This is  fun.  That's what this is! This is b--  fun.  And you know what? I'm not having any f--  blackmail!  This is not f--  blackmail!  Not for me.  It's  what best friends do. This is  what best friends do.  You're a  fun.  guy! You're a piece of  fun.  You are  a good  friend!  You are  a good  friend!  Alright? I'm serious.
amir: Thank you, Ace! Thank you.
jake: ...Just keep rolling, I'll jump in the river.
amir: Alright. Three, two, one, action!
jake:  Okay, we have to get back to my apartment, now.
amir: That was epic, man. I totally recorded it-- Oh, shit...
jake: Did you get it?
amir: Uhh, well, good news and bad news, heh: Good news is, you get to jump in the river again! Yay! That was... fun. The bad news is, due to a camera malfunction, the, um... the footage was sort of lost. Not human error--
amir: N-- ow! Stop-- high-fiving my-- face!
jake: You... definitely deleted that footage, though?
amir: Yeah. I'm gonna delete it... Either that, or I'll do you one better!

No Intro
amir: Ever had a shit day? I've had a shit life.
jake: What's the matter man. You're not happy to be thirty? You having a bad birthday?
amir: Bad birthday, nah. Bad you!
jake: Jesus Christ.
amir: I've been alive for almost a decade now-
jake: Wrong.
amir: And I have nothing to show for it, save for a few successful business ventures and a lovely wife!
jake: You don't have those things.
amir: Kick me while I'm down why don't you?
jake: Well why all this sadness? Why now?
amir: I just got a letter from myself. Sent to me when I was 12 years old as part of a sixth grade class project where every student was supposed to send a letter to your future self. Turns out, every single student sent a letter to me. Yeah, 28 different letters that all start out with the same sentence: I hope you're not alive to read this. How do you think that makes me feel?
jake: I don't know, bad.
amir: Wrong! ...Like shit!
jake: So I wasn't wrong.
amir: Oh, this one's a gem, alright, you're gonna love this one.
jake: What would I love about this?
amir : Dear Amir, I hope you're not alive to read this. So, you have a black heart and no brain. You're ruthless mean and dumb. P.S. Do the Bills ever win the superbowl?  Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
jake: Yeah, that's pretty mean for a 12 year old.
amir: That one's from the teacher!
jake: Ms. Nesbit?
amir: MS. Nesbit actually, she would have been pissed at you.
jake: I said Ms. Nesbit.
amir: You want one from a mean tween though? Meaner than you've ever seen? Well I got one for you, Mr. Bean.
jake: Just read the letter.
amir : Dear Amir, I hope you're not alive to read this. Every day my dad gives me poison to sneak into your thermos of soup.  All I want for my birthday is the courage to finally kill you. He said you're dad is an evil man and he's raising you to be the spawn of Satan. Love, Penis Anthony Doubineux. P.S. Go Bills. Can you believe I knew a kid with the last name Doubineux?
jake: Yeah, I know him.
amir: How do you know Doobs?
jake: I've met him. Several times.
amir: Letter the third from my best friend Kyle. Dear Amir, DIE, Go Bills, Love Kyle.
jake: You're adding love to the end of it.
amir: No.
jake: Did you grow up in Buffalo?
amir: Niagara Falls actually. My mom is a French-Canadian queen and my dad is an Army rat.
jake: What?
amir: Mainly a rat coward who went AWOL during his time at Vietnam. Faked his own death now twice but thrice during the span of 18 months and gave away the names and locations of over 1000 of his comrades.
jake: God, what a traitor!
amir: Yeah! For the he received the black heart. Congressional medal of dishonor.
jake: I feel like every time we have a conversation I just, I get so sad for you.
amir: Worry not. I still have my successful business ventures and a lovely wife HOLY SHIT is that NFL hall of fame quarterback and former Buffalo Bills superstar Jim Kelly?
jake: There's no one behind me.
amir: Mr. Kelly, sign my ball, please!
rosie: Ahh!
guy: He's dead.
jake: Hey!
hostess : Hey!
jake: Uh, two please.
hostess: Sure.
amir: Yup, two for dinner, heheh!
hostess: Great!
amir: Though usually we just eat pussy.
jake: 'Later.
amir: Wait!
waitress : How's the steak?
amir: Fine... though I think I need a martini after that whole exchange.
amir: Catch that?
waitress: Yup. One martini comin' up!
amir: No: what happened with me and my friend? Best friend, actually. Or so I thought.
waitress: Oh. No.
amir: He ditch-ditch-ditched me.
amir: Actually, one second. Where's the hostess? Let's call her over; she saw the whole thing.
waitress: Let go of my arm... and I'll go get her.
amir: Fine.
amir: Actually, what's her name? I can just call her over.
waitress: It's Jessica. I'll just go grab--
amir: Perfect. Jessica! Jessica!
amir: You're... hurting my fingers, honestly.
jessica: Are you okay?
amir: Jess! Hi. I was just telling, um...
amir: That's when you say your name, sweetheart. It's called flirting.  You saw when my best friend left, right? After I told that good joke?
jessica: ...Yeah.
amir: Look, I knew you thought it was funny, didn't you? For an off-the-cuff one-liner?
jessica: Um...
amir: Um what?
jessica: ...It was fine,
amir:  It was fine... No it was not fine... It was good...  Okay, tell it like it is. All right? Obviously I wouldn't Tweet it. I have a very unpopular twitter account: USARice. Follow it if you scare!  Moo ooo ahh ahh ahh...
amir: DO you honestly think he should have left, though? Over one joke?
jessica: Well, I kinda get the sense that you make those jokes a lot...
amir: Granted! Okay? But that's almost enough out of you, so please... proceed with caution.
jessica: Well maybe he was just fed up, and... didn't want to be here anymore.
amir: And that actually is enough out of you. Thank you so much, Jessica; you're trying to be nice, but you're giving me a legit migraine right now.
jessica: Well I also got the sense that he didn't want to be here to begin with, so...
amir:  It's my birthday today.  Wow, suddenly the customer's always right! I'll have that martini for free now, and as for the steak, I think... no, in fact I know I'm going to be eating it off your ass.
amir : Ha ha ha ha ha ha! Woo! Yeah! That's a lawsuit. That is a lawsuit. Good news, everybody! My name's Jake Hurwitz and dinner's on me, because this establishment now owes me a million dollars! In the form of a suit.  Class action!
jessica: It's fine, Chloe. It's gonna be fine.
amir: Yeah, it's fine! It's fine? Or do I have a video tape... of the whole frickin' thing?
amir:  It's fine? Or do I have a video tape of the whole frickin' thing?
amir: Nooooo!
jake: Hey, man. I'm sorry. I cooled off. It's just I really hate when you make those jokes. You know?
jake: What's going on? Did you make this girl cry?
amir: I made her realize that she was being a proud little diva tramp floozy!
amir: That's another lawsuit! That is another lawsuit, unbelievable! Two for the price of fun! I'm rich... James, bitch!

EPISODE
amir: Woo! Time!
jake: Woah.
amir: Hey.
jake: What was your time?
amir: What?
jake: How long was your run? How long did it take you?
amir: Oh, I didn't run.  Took a cab to work; I was just, uh, asking what time it was.  12:19.
jake: 4 PM.
amir: What?
jake: It's 4 PM.  That makes you like 6 or 7 hours late today.
amir: 6. Idiot.
jake: I'm not an idiot; you don't know what time work starts.
amir: What do you think my biggest weakness is? Correction: was my biggest weakness is?
jake: You're not smart?
amir: No.
jake: You get angry easily?
amir: No exercise gear, exactly right.
jake: You also seem incapable of going with the flow of a conversation.  You have like some sort of agenda, you're going to make your point no matter what I contribute.
amir: No arm warmer.  No tank.  A lack of zero compression pants.
jake: You had a lack of zero compression pants?
amir: I went to Sports Authority, and I got calm.
jake: What?
amir: My life has been a whirlwind ever since Passover. Yeah, my dad gave me a hundred dollar bill to go fuck myself with.  Luckily for me, they accept that at most sporting goods stores.  Ow.
jake: If it's a hundred dollar bill, then they accept it anywhere.
amir : Ugh, these things never get any easier to swallow.  Popped a molly, I'm sweatin', woo!
jake: Have you actually started exercising?
amir: Not yet, I'm a triathlete.  As in, I'm trying to be an athlete.
jake: By buying those clothes?
amir : They say to dress for the job you want.  And I want a blow job.
jake: You know, that's not even a stretch, that's the macarena.  You can leave, or you can get to work.
amir: I'm actually pretty depressed about all this shit.  I feel like I can't get my act together at all.
jake:  Cool, man, I'm sorry to hear that.  What do you want me to say?
amir: I spent the better part of a G of not my own money trying to make my old man proud.  Turns out the only thing he could be proud of, is that his son is a piece of shit.
jake: Why would he be proud of that?
amir: I like to make people laugh, you know?  Except the only problem is I'm the only joke in this room.  And what's so funny about a grown-ass loser?
jake: I guess it's funny that you're having this realization in compression pants.
amir: That's true.
jake: No, man, I was making fun of you.
amir: Thanks, man.  I needed to hear that.
jake: Don't thank me, I was being mean to you.
amir: Hey, everybody: get a load of these pants.
amir: Oppa gangnam style!
amir dressed as blonde woman : I want to give you the job you want: a blow job.
amir: Popped a molly, I'm sweatin', woo!
jake: Yeah, that's him.
police officer: We found him passed out outside of a Sports Authority shouting obscenities at strangers.
jake: Is he dead?
police officer: Unfortunately, no.  He's just sleepy and frozen.
amir: Woo!
INTRO
jake: Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir.  This one's for all the pretty girls out there.
amir: Creep.

jake: Don't worry about it, man.  Hooking up with babes is like second nature to me.
amir: I know, I just, I haven't kissed anybody since you killed my girlfriend.
jake: Drop it, okay?  You can't poison tonight with your negative energy.
jake:   You know, I always said a woman's place was in the kitchen...as the head chef...at a 5-star restaurant.
girl #1: Idiot.

amir: I will!
jake:  Hey dude, 3 o'clock.
amir: Oh yeah? am or pm?
jake: Doesn't matter.
amir: Well, analog or digital?  Cuz I can't read analog.
jake: You know, then it really doesn't matter.
amir: Well, is it the hour hand or the minute hand?
jake: Just, forget it.
amir: Very cool!
jake: It's to the right.
jake: Other right.
jake: Wow!

bartender:   She's not conscious but she's breathing, yeah.
amir:  Hey, body shots!
amir:  Excuse me, are you a Capital One card?  Cuz, what's in YOUR wallet?
jake: Nice.
amir: She must not watch commercials.  That's not on me.  It's a product of the DVR culture that we live in!
jake:  Hey...I made a bet with my friend here.
girl #4: What's the bet?
amir: Fuck if I know.
jake: He bet me I couldn't talk to the prettiest girl here -
amir: Oh, I most certainly did not, I do not wager.
jake: shhh - and get her number.
amir: Bull shite!
girl #4: I'm gonna go.
amir:  Please do!  This entire conversation is based on a false premise!  Woah...swing and a diss.  Heh heh.  Was that wager for real, though?  Cuz if so, you owe me a G.
amir:  Girl, are you a Volkswagon?  Cuz, drivers wanted!
amir:  Wow...another DVR girl... you can't fast forward through life!
girl #6: So...I will make out with you.
jake: Awesome.
girl #6: Keep in mind, I will not like it!
jake: Fine. Fine.
girl #6: AND you have to put your wallet in this jar of pickles.
jake: Oh wow, I'll just cancel my credit cards.  Bet you didn't think of that, dumb ass.
girl #6: AND your Iphone.
jake: Whew...you know what, that's almost a deal-breaker.  Oh, wait, no it's not!
girl #6: Submerge it.
jake: Submerge it for second base.
girl #6: Okay, submerge it, and I'll let you kiss my hand.
jake: Worth it!
jake: I hooked up!  I hooked up!
jake: Barkeep, come on, I need a bag of rice, stat!  I have to get my phone in rice in the next two minutes or she's a goner.  I know, cuz I've lost 6 other Iphones to that cruel mistress.
jake: Hey, if you think this is sad, you should read my diary.  Every single day reads like a fucking suicide note.
girl #7: Me too.
jake: Yeeesh. Hey, I'm engaged, sweetheart.
amir:  Hey, who do you ladies think is better looking?  Me, or my boy over here.
jake: No, sorry, you know what?  Don't answer that.  Cuz either you guys are gonna tell the truth and hurt HIS feelings, or lie and hurt mine.
girl #8: It's him .  And I'm not lying.
jake:  Congratulations, friend, what's your name? What's your number?
jake: You know what, you have the least popular opinion in the bar.
girl #8 :  Who do you think is better looking?
girl #9: Glasses. 
jake: Yeah, fucking right!  How so??  How so??
amir: You're wrong.
jake:  This has been the highlight of my year.  What a ride.  Come here.
girl #6: Oh!
jake:  Can you, sorry, don't make that noise, cuz it makes me feel like shit.
amir: Okay, bad news bears, I think we have to go, as I was pepper sprayed just now, not once, but thrice in what I thought was a unisex bathroom.
jake: Don't worry, buddy.  Happens to me all the time.   Hey, barkeep, we need a glass of whole milk.  Okay, my friend here just had his mace cherry popped.
bartender:  Yeah, you guys gotta leave.
jake: Okay, absolutely understandable.  I already hooked up tonight.   That burns your nostrils if you inhale it, dude.

jake: I said nevermind.
amir: I wanna know.
jake: I dunno. Two dozen?
amir: I am the proud owner of OneAlmond.com.
jake: What do you think I said?
amir: Huh?
jake: When you asked me how much is the perfect amount of Almonds, what do you think I said?
amir: Lemme rephrase that -- How much do you think Google.com is worth?
jake: Billions. Tens of Billions of Dollars.
amir: And OneAlmond.com?
jake: Zero dollars.
amir: Zero dollars or zero BILLION dollars?
jake: Both. Zero dollars.
amir:  How much would you pay for court seats at the Yankees? Gun to your head how much would you pay for court seats to the Yankees.
jake: Don't put your hand up like that.
amir: How much would you pay?
jake: Put your hand down, that's... irritating me.
amir: What, why?
jake: It's like
amir: Invading your space?
jake: Yeah, it's like you're challenging me. Your interrupting me as you want me to speak and it makes me angry.
amir: What is it about One Almond that's just perfect?
jake: I don't know. Nothing?
amir: Don't just say nothing. Cause it's not just a domain name, I'm building an empire.
jake: Right now it's a photo of you, holding a single walnut.
amir: Almond.
jake: It's not.
amir: Ok you know what? No. How about no. For once, you're gonna tell me what you really think. Cause I'm a God damn genius and I'm tired of feeling like a chump in your eyes.
jake: I'm jealous, ok? I'm jealous I didn't think of onealmond.com first because I think it's a great idea and it's gonna be worth billions. I'm just being negative cause I'm jealous, there, that's it. Let's drop it.
amir: You mean that?
jake: Yeah.
AMIR  Hey Danny? Yup, I talked to a colleague with a more level head as you suggested and guess what? HE AGREED WITH ME BITCH! SO TAKE YOUR OFFER AND GO FUCK YOURSELF WITH IT! I DON'T CARE IF MY ATTITUDE IS CLOSING THE DOOR FOR FUTURE NEGOTIATIONS! YOU'RE A RAT WEASLE. YOU ALWAYS HAVE BEEN, AND MAYBE NOT ALWAYS WILL BE BUT TO ME YOU WILL AT LEAST BE ONE.

amir: Some billionaire real estate mogul called me this morning -- he's building a luxury highrise on ONE ALMOND street and offered me 1.5 million for the domain name, let alone the pic of me with that cashew or whatever the fuck.
jake: Walnut.
amir: Either way. I felt like I was sitting on a goldmine, and now my notion has been confirmed by YOU, my best friend. SO I guess I have you to SPANK for that.
Amir starts getting up.
jake: Sit down. Do not come over here to spank me.
amir: But I must. I must Spank you very much.
jake: Sit the fuck down dude, you're making me nervous.
Amir slides under the table.

Amir flicks his tongue between his fingers.

An intern, Meryl, walks in.
meryl: I'm sorry is this a bad time?
amir: Not for me it's not.
meryl: It's Mr. Greenberg right?
amir: Actually it's CEOh- yeah! MR. Mr. Greenberg to you.
meryl: Ok. I'm Meryl. And I'm an intern here, and I really need to go home early today.
amir: Take a seat.
Meryl sits.
amir:  What's bothering you kid?
meryl: It's kind of private.
amir: Well I'm kind of your boss. Right? And what you're doing is kind of affecting your performance, so unless you kinda tell me what's kinda private, I'm gonna fire you. And not in a kind of way. In an actual way.
meryl: I just found out I'm six months pregnant.
amir: Oh?
meryl: That's too late to terminate. My parents hate my boyfriend and they think I'm still a virgin. They're gonna disown me. I dunno what to do.
amir: Stop it, alright, Meryl, listen to me... Your-- your life is over.
MERYL - What?
amir: And not in a good way, not in like a LETS START OVER kinda way, in a, uh, I MIGHT AS WELL BE DEAD kinda way.  Welcome to Hell. Population... two.
meryl:  I know.
amir: Lemme ask you what does the old boyfriend have to say about this?
meryl: Randy doesn't know yet.
amir: Wow gay name.
MERYL  I'm so afraid he's gonna leave me.
amir: Why are you afraid of that? Why aren't you sure that he will? I mean, I'm not afraid of the sun rising and setting tomorrow because I know it's going to happen. Right? You know what else I'm sure of? You're gonna raise that baby by yourself.
Meryl starts to cry.
amir: Don't cry, come on, don't cry. It's just that you're so ugly when you cry. It's true. You look ugly when you cry, I should say.
Meryl cries harder. Paul enters with Will.
paul: Well I don't know who you know in the DA's office, but the city's not going to press charges.
amir: Woo!
paul: However, I am going to fire you.
amir: No!!!
Will claps
paul : Who are you?
meryl: I'm an intern. I was in here trying to cut out of work early to go to this fucking rave but this jackass has been grilling me so hard that I have to come clean. He has a keen sense of right and wrong and a true gravitas about him. In fact... permission to sit on your face?
amir: Denied!
paul: Re-hired!
amir: Hyeah!!!
will: What? But sir, this makes no sense!
paul: What are you gonna do. Hey Amir,  how'd you know she wasn't prgenant?
amir: To be honest, Paul, I didn't!
Everyone cracks up.
Jake walks in wearing a wife beater and covered in glowsticks.
jake: Hey Meryl did you get the day off yet? For your the uh... the pregnancy? Oh man, I'm high.

doobs: Well now I'm filthy, stinkin' rich when this things gets released to the public. And I hope it bites you on your filthy, little ass. Just like your father did to me with his tiny, spindly, little legs.
jake: Your dad bit him on the ass with his legs?
usher: Jakey, jakey eggs and stupid! No, no, no. Just because those lips are super good at  munching down on some d, doesn't mean they can ask questions. There will be a Question and Answer at the end. No more questions. Ever again. I have a question.
doobs: Yes, you. The bell hop.
usher: How thin are Amir's father's legs?
doobs: Nightmare-ishly thin. 3 centimeters in diameter. No bones, just blood and skin. He wrapped them around my waist like a limp garden hose and no matter how hard I struggled to get free, he'd put them tighter and tighter like a boa constrictor. Or worse still, a garden snake! You know, I still have dreams about them.
amir: Nightmares?
doobs: No, A-smears, dreams.
usher: Would you like a snack?
doobs: I'd love one.
usher: Up.
doobs: Alley-oop

jake: Actually I haven't!
jake: Hey! No!
ben: Just kidding,  it's a joke, it's a joke...
ben: ...it's a joke, it's a joke.
jake: Not funny.

penis: Yeah.
ben: Fantastic, do you have any ideas for maybe, I don't know- a sequel?
penis: Mmmm, I've got ideas for a squeak-quel.
ben: Tell me.
penis: Well this time around I don't want any studio muckin' it up with all its bullshit, grass-roots, guerilla-style film making...
jake: Get your head out of there!
ben: Excuse me!
julia: Why is he trying to put his face in your crotch?
jake: I don't know-
ben : Hey, Deborah, I've got a question...
julia: Hey!
ben: Did your head hurt?
julia: No, it doesn't hurt.
ben: Did your head hurt when you rose from hell and you hit your head on the ceiling, you- devil angel.
julia: What? Are you trying to pick me up?
ben: I don't know
jake: Bad line.
ben: Are you trying to pick me up? It seems like you are! If it's not me then who? Who do you love?
julia:  I actually have a really big crush on... Amir.
jake : Jesus Christ dude, if you're here then who's doing the Q and A?
amir: I shouldn't- BUT I DID!
jake : This is your movie, you should be up there right?
penis: Will you be quiet? I'm trying to listen to the Q and A. But I already got what I came here for.  Amir you say? Hmmm. Very interesting. 
amir : ...and that's what I call...
amir and penis: ...an ice cream social!
ben : Unbelievable! Fantastic job. Now, does anybody else have any other questions?
penis: I have a question.
ben : What?
penis: Yeah, brother.  It's for the lady.  Julie, will you marry me?  Knowing full well that you will be used in the ongoing chess match that is the life between Amir and myself.  You the pawn and me the queen.
julia : Yes. Yes, yes I will!
penis : Then you are my wife! Welcome to Hollywood, kid, you got moxie and I like it.
jake: I don't think that's official, you need a priest or something.
ben: I am a priest! Congratulations, you have been wedding-ed 
julia : I'm gonna give you so many babies.
penis: I'm gonna hit it. And everytime I hit it, I'm gonna think of Amir.
jake: No, I don't think that's the insult you want it to mean-
amir: Yes! It is.
ben: I now pronounce you: man and wife 
jake: Still not official-
ben : Celebration!
jake: Stop! Stop!
jake: Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir!
amir: That's an oxymoron.
jake: How?
amir: What?
amir: March Madness Bracket, huh? This year I filled out a March Madness packet! 100 different permutations, each one representing every single possible outcome!
jake: There are 68 games, there are way more than 100 possible outcomes.
amir: Fook me, huh? No, Fook Duke!
jake: I didn't say fook you.
amir: It's a joke, Jake, okay? I can't set it up and knock it down, just play along for once! God damn it!
amir: Who do you have as your write-in candidate?
jake: There is no write-in candidate.
amir: Exactly right. It was a trick question.
jake: You have Mickey Mouse in your Final Four.
amir: Trick question I said! As in he's a tricky little mouse bitch who can scamper his way past the Elite Eight. I'm not saying I'm proud of the little rat diva but I can say I can see him doing it! Also, don't look at my sheet! Look at my sheet, that's a cheat! Thats a DQ!
jake: Hey! Stop it!
amir: Minnesota, huh? How about a mini soda?
amir: Is there a size Coke that would have made you laugh?
jake: No it's just that you've filled out--
amir: Ole Miss! Donald. Bet the farm. E-i-e-i. No!
jake: When do you do this?
amir: What?
jake: When do you come up with these shitty rhymes?
amir: It's not even a "my jokes are bad" thing, I know you think it's that way, but that mini soda thing crushed yesterday at my cousin's brit.
jake: Ew!
amir: I really think that the diva mouse can take it this year, this crazy little shifty mouse.
jake: I know that's what you think.
amir: No, I'm serious! I mean, he's got a snowball's chance in hell, sure, but in this tournament that's all you need. I mean, who had 'Nova topping Georgetown in '85, nobody.
jake: People had it. I mean, it was a long shot, but at least it was a basketball team.
amir: Fuckin' asshole.
jake: What?! What did you just say? Say it again.
amir: Butler University. Hey Jake, the butler did it! They're Final Four bound. And gagged!
jake: You crossed them out.
amir: What?
jake: You don't have Butler, you crossed them out. That's where you wrote Mickey Mouse.
amir: That tricky mouse fink is up to tricks! I didn't cross them out, you gotta believe me. Do you believe me?
jake: No!
amir: This year's Cinderella story? It's gonna be me! I'm gonna wear a gown to the Final Four and sit on a pumpkin instead of a seat.
What's the opposite of a Prince Charming, you ask. How about a Dunce Harming?
jake: Not quite buddy. A dunce, a prince, not quite.
amir: Yeah, I know it's not quite there, I was just hoping you weren't listening.
jake: You talk, hoping I'm not listening?
amir: Oh, Syracuse winning it all, huh? Bold!
jake: You don't like that pick?
amir: No, I love that pick. Especially because it's 2003, right? Carmelo's still playing basketball? We just killed Saddam Hussein, so that's a positive.
jake: I get it.
amir: What?
jake: I get it!
amir: So, George gets a town, Louis gets a ville, and what does little ol' Amir get? Nothing but a public urination ticket and a slap on the wrist. That's not fair.
jake: What?
amir: Whoah, great news! In your world, iTunes just launched, that's a great investment opportunity!
jake: I'll change the pick!
amir: Why would you? I'm sure the Governator, you know Arnold Schwarzenegger, the new governor of California would endorse your pick, especially if he just got finished watching Finding Nemo, the new Pixar flick that just came out!
jake: How do you know so much about 2003?!
amir: How do you know so little about basketball?!
jake: You still have MICKEY MOUSE winning it all!
amir: That's because he's a diva little mousey bitch!
amir: Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir, and you're beautiful just the way you are.
jake: That's nice.
amir: I was talking to you.
jake: No.
jake: Morning, man.
amir:  WAZZUP!
jake: No. No, okay?
amir: Oh yeah!
jake: Tell you what, dude... Just give me??give me the.. child, and uh... get out of here. Leave.
amir: This is my baby, Bjorn. In a BabyBjrn. Guess what day he was bjorn .
jake: I don't care what day he was bjorn . I care about his family, okay? His mom and dad who miss him, and??
amir: I'm his daddy now!  Isn't that right, little pig shit?
jake: Don't.. do that, man.
amir: Relax, dude, okay? Come over tonight, hey? We'll rent a movie: The Bjorn  Identity, starring Jason Bjorn ?
jake: It's actually starring Matt Damon.
amir: Oh yeah, the guy from Outbreak, with the airbjorn  illness.
jake: You're thinking of Contagion now.
amir: Guess what my favorite tennis player is.
jake: Bjrn Borg.
amir: Patrick.. Rafter. ...He was a bjorn  winner.
jake: Stop saying "bjorn." You know what? I'm calling the police. I feel like I've been doing this way too much recently.
amir: You're gonna look like such a fool when they get here.
jake:  Doubtful.
cop: There he is.
jake:  Wow, they didn't even need to pick up. Sir, I can and will testify against this.. criminal.
cop: Let me see those hands.
jake: You heard the man.
cop: So I can shake them.
jake: What?
cop: Permission to congratulate the hero that saved my son's life.
amir:  Denied.
cop:  Understood.
jake: What's going on right now?
cop: I was walking my child to daycare when I heard gunfire. A lot of people were dying, and I froze. But this brave, brave man stepped forward and took my son off my hands so I could apprehend a murderer.
jake: You sure he didn't just take advantage of the situation in order to steal your baby?
cop: WOW. Permission to kick this man's ass, sir.
amir: Denied. Denied.
jake: I just got this text message from him five minutes ago. "Hey dude, jacked a baby on the way to work. This is gonna be hilarious. From a cop, no less. A little piggy."
cop: Let me see that.
jake: Sure thing. Yeah, you know what, in fact, anything I can do to help. I always wanted to be a police officer myself, and uh, I guess this makes it official??Hey! Come on...  God...
cop:  Now it doesn't say anything.
jake: Holy crap, that was so??that was, like, insanely easy for you, huh? You are strong as shit. This is like??that's a 4 so that's a heavier phone, there's a steel band, I mean??holy wow, that is...
cop: Permission to hug my son again, sir. Permission to squeeze his rosy cheeks.
amir: Oh! You wanna.. squeeze these cheeks, huh? These, uh??this cute little face, this chunky munchkin little grapefruit guy, huh? You wanna squeeze this little squeezeball? 
cop: Yes, very much so.
amir: Denied.
cop: You are the boss of me.  
jake: Dude... go take your son back.  HEY! OW! AH!
cop: Permission to break this perp's arm, sir!
jake:  I'm not a perp! Deny him! Deny him!
amir:  ...Granted.
jake: NO...!
cop: NYAHHH!!! 
jake: AHHH!!!
THE END
amir: Hey, you're not watching Jake and Amir!
jake: What?
amir: Reverse psychology.
jake: It's not.
amir: It is!
amir: Fur is murder!
jake: Son of a bitch, I'm not wearing any fur.
amir: Oh, please...
jake: You're wearing fur! You're wearing a lot of fur! Fur coat! Fur hat! That's??Yeah, that's a mink scarf!  I see it!
amir: I didn't kill these animals!
jake: You know, there's also a dead iguana in your pocket. 
amir: ...Or am I just happy to see you.
jake: It's a dead iguana.
amir: I'm also happy to see you!
jake: What animals do you think I killed to make this sweater?
amir: It doesn't matter; you know why?  'Cause there's blood on your hands!
jake:  Paint.
amir: No, that's??that's actually possum blood; I'm sorry.
jake: Oh my god...
amir: What, do you want me to pay for the dry cleaning??all right, how much do I owe you?  One hundred? Two hundred? Take the frickin' money. Three hundred?
jake: Stop it! Your wallet is a dead rat!
amir: Oh! Very clever! Har, har, har!
jake: I'm not trying to be clever; it looks like you cut open a dead rat. Maybe it was alive when you did it, and then you filled it with bloody money.
amir:  Bloody money! Bloody money! You're not British, man!  OH!  AH!  UH!
jake: All right, you know what? I wanna know why you did this; walk me through your logic. Take your time. I will not interrupt you.
amir: It's actually kinda silly.  I woke up late??
jake: You're an asshole.
amir: Whoa! You said you wouldn't interrupt me!
jake: You know what I think happened? I think you got into the idea of owning fur after some weird conversation you had with your cousin Leron or some strange show you saw on TV. You became fur-obsessed, going on a morbid spending spree. And when you ran out of acceptable animals to wear on your body, your blood-thirsty raid took you to the deep, dark corners of the animal wear/ware kingdom, like that pocket iguana or your rat wallet. Either way, you reek of mink and rat blood! So go home! 
amir: Can I talk?
jake: No.
amir: Are you done?
jake: No, you can go home.
amir: Can I speak now??
jake: You know, why don't you at least admit that you're hot in that jacket right now?
amir: I'm boiling. Maybe I can join you in your ivory tower for just a couple minutes, and that'll help me cool off. Or I can hop upon your high horse, and we can go for a ride! You know what? I got this idea from having a conversation with my cousin Leron, not from a "television show," as you astutely observed.
jake: You know, I also said that. That was my first guess.
amir: Secondly, yeah! I became fur-obsessed! You know, it's my nature to take things too far; some people love me for that.
jake: Nobody loves you.. for anything.
amir:  OH!
jake: No, that did hurt you; I know it.
amir: A little bit, yes, because I didn't think you'd get that personal.
jake: Just move on.
amir: I became blood-hungry! Sure, who wouldn't? And who wouldn't feel a little bit guilty after strangling a scared iguana? Obviously, animals can't...  talk! But this little guy was begging me with his eyes for mercy. I don't know if you've ever seen an iguana cry before, but I know for a fact that I have.
jake: Can you stop talking about strangling the iguana?
amir: And as for your last point, I think I will go home as this has turned into a public shaming of me! Adieu!
jake: Are you wearing dead doves on your feet?
amir: THEY'RE RAVENS.
jake: They're white.
amir: THEY'RE... DOVES.
THE END
intro:
amir: Hey you're watching Bill and Ted
jake: Nope they're not...
amir: WELL I AM!
jake: DON'T cry and pinch me..
amir:  I'm coming out so you better get the party started, I'm coming out I'm coming..
jake: You okay?
amir: OKAY? I'm better than okay, I'M GAY, best part of my day, we're officially now husbands with each other
jake: No, what are you talking about?
amir: I saw your Facebook profile pic dude, with the eh the pink minus'
jake: The equal sign
amir: No they were like two dashes
jake: IT'S A EQUAL SIGN, I'M RIGHT
amir: NO the two, the dashes that are like...
jake: It's an EQUAL SIGN yeah..
amir: Whatever...
jake: NO WHATEVER, did you really just not know what an equal sign was
amir: I forgot...
jake: It's like the first thing they teach you
amir: Either way, since we have to get married gay, I thought I'd...  I thought I'd have to snatch
jake: Yeah it's fine, not everything you say has to rhyme
amir: I thought I'd had to snatch you up before some other beautiful bow out there did
jake: Okay, No, just no, you've got this entirely wrong
amir: Oh my god, I feel a fool
jake: As you should
amir: Who is he?
jake: No...
amir:  At least give me the curtsey of telling me his name so I can CURSE HIM AT NIGHT
jake: Nobody has to get gay married
amir: wwwwwhat are you talking about
jake: Marriage Equality doesn't mean I have to marry another guy
amir: Mmmmm yeah it does 
jake: Mmmmm No it doesn't
amir: Mmmmm then why else would people be so pissed you nim-rod
jake: You're the dumb one
amir: The conservative right, yeah, they've been vehemently opposed to this issue, and you know why, because they are forcing people to get gay married, i mean i wouldn't want to be forcibly gay married to someone unless i knew someone as chill as you that i would down to settle down with...
jake: No
amir: ...maybe start a family with someday...I know I know someday you have a career
jake: Some people just don't believe that same sex couples should be allowed to marry
jake: I'm not joking
amir: THAT'S WHY I'M MARRYING YOU
jake: I'M NOT JOKING
amir: Jesus...that's fucked up
jake: I know...
amir: Who are they to tell us how to live our lives...
jake: You're right...but...me and you...we're not gay...
amir: ahuh...like hell we aren't, you're my best friend
jake: yeah that's not gay you just wanna hang out with me all the time
amir: HOHOHAHA aren't you Mr Confident, no wonder you found a husband so fast, hey tell me? is he a chubby hubby like the Ben and Jerry's flavour hahha
jake: Bad joke...
amir: WHATS HIS NAME!!!!!!
jake: I just think if people wanna get married they should be allowed to
amir: Agreed, except for me and you evidently, you know my mother was right, CONGRADULATIONS JAKE, you're married to a divorcee and a fiance
jake: That's not how that works, and I think our marriage is a sham anyway because aside from meeting to agree to it I probably should have at least been present at the ceremony
amir: You know I thought so too much for three hand jobs and a bottle of Nytol that drag queen down in the west villages was singing a different tune
jake: Awful, Disgusting, Unofficial...
amir: And yet here we are...Officially Wed  Till death do we shart...HO YEAH 
jake: Don't try to shart, don't do this!!
amir:  It's natural baby
jake: It's not natural you're forcing it out
amir: It's a coincidence
jake: It's not a coincidence, your voice is...strayed
amir: Here comes the tadpole, just one, little, guppy, flying, out of my, rectum, ohhhhhh, HI DE HO, ehehaha
jake: That was so much more than a tadpole, or a guppy
amir: Can you believe that you have to be with this ass for the rest of your life,
Credit Roll
special message:
jake: Hey Jake and Amir here, that might of been a silly video but it did have an important message
amir: That's right there is nothing funny about sharting
jake: We all know somebody whos sharted
amir: That's right we share the freeways with them, subways, office building, schools...they deserve the same rights as we do...sharters do...
jake: Support gay marriage
intro:
jake: Hey, you're watching jake and amir.
amir: And there's a small chance that nobody will come to your funeral.
jake: Unnecessarily mean.
amir:  Whatever.
amir: ...Jake.
jake: Amir.
amir: ...Call me Jake. 
jake: Absolutely not.
amir: I have a feeling you'll be calling me all day and night. To thank me for the gift that I got you when you open your drawer and find it.
jake: I'll look after work, alright?
amir: You'll look before work! You'll look before work or I'll take it back!
jake: Don't get mad at me, okay? Work's already started, one, and two: fine, dude, take it back.
amir: That was an idle threat you ingrate! Open the fricken drawer! Open the fricken box!--
jake: Jesus! Jesus! Fine! Fine.
jake: You know, and just so you know, the thought of you brainstorming a gift, going out shopping for a gift, buying something and then wrapping it up with this little bow and sneaking it into work and hiding it in my desk...--
amir:  Right, it's great!
jake: No, it's not great!
jake: It really freaks me out, and I don't think you should do-  and this is a Rolex! It's a Rolex, buddy!
amir: You know how you're always like, uhh, "What time is it?" 
jake: I've never said that to you before.. in my life.
amir: Well, it's time for me to get you a new watch.
amir: Fffffuck off for not laughing at that, you DIVA-- you diva little--
jake:  You're an ass. You're an asshole! I don't want this gift from you!
amir: --I'm sorry, you're a cunt!
jake: Shut up dude! You just yelled "cunt" in the office.
amir: I'm sorry. I'm sorry for that it was obviously a little too much.
jake: Alright, you know what? 
amir: You're right, what are we doing? This isn't us!  Oh.
jake: Don't.. hug me. No, okay?  What is this manila folder  Sketches. Photos. A VENN DIAGRAM. I mean dude, this is psychotic!
amir: What's psychotic is you trying to embarrass me for caring about you too much.
jake: You wrote a teleplay... A full-on script about how you wanted this moment to play out!
amir: And the messed-up thing? I was pretty fricken close.
jake: You weren't at all! "Upon seeing the watch he's dreamt of but never described aloud, Jake cries tears of soy."? Is that a typo?
amir:  No. I don't mistype.
jake: You wrote my name as "J J K A E" every single time.
amir: Poetic license.
jake: "He realizes only his soulmate could've seen into his mind's eye and found his dream watch, the same one he never knew he even wanted."  "Jake is struck by the awe of this moment." You know.. that's too much scene direction.
amir: It's supposed to come through in the performance.
jake: Bad writing.
amir: Bad writing huh? Nah. 
jake: Bad me, I know.
amir: ...Bad you!
jake: Right, I said that.
amir: Try it on! Do me the courtesy!
jake:  I actually can't try it on, 'cause I don't know how many links you got removed from this thing, but it might as well be a ring.
amir: We all know you have notoriously small wrists.
jake: Nobody has wrists this small; they'd be dead.
amir: Then I can return it
jake: You know, I'm not sure you can, 'cause according to your script, you ripped up the receipt in front of the watch salesman. You said "What's your return policy? Because if you think Jake will ever return this, it's a fallacy."
amir: Yeah and you know what he did?
jake: According to your script he "cried tears of soy."
amir:  CRIED TEARS OF SOY, yeah, exactly right!
jake: That's not a real thing. That can't happen.
amir: Really? Okay, here we go, 'cause look at this! 
jake: Huh!
amir: Yeah!
jake: Oh my god, HELP US!
amir: I'm cryin'!
jake: He's crying soy!
amir: Tears of soy!
jake: Tears of soy!
amir:  Oh, I'm beefing! I'm beefing soy!
j: What's up? It's Jake and Amir! A: Ooh, what's up, you're a real rap star. J: Shut up.
j: C'mon baby, c'mon fever mode. OH! FEVER MODE! Yes. Let me show this game my "oh!" face. Oh, oh,-... Agh! Damnit.
Amir arrives and sits next to him on couch
a: What are you doing?
j: Trying to play Tiny Wings man! What're you doing, trying to ruin my life. Wait, scratch that, succeeding in Ruining. My. Life.
a: There was a company-wide meeting and you weren't there and people got concerned because they haven't seen you around the office!
j: Really? They couldn't jus' figure out I had better things to POO!?
Jake makes loud and crude farting noises, and gestures his phone coming out of his pants
j: OH! plugs nose
There is a complete silence for a good 10 seconds.
a: Uh, you okay?
j: I'm fine.
a: Why don't you take a break from playing this g-
j: DEAD ARM! CHARLIE HORSE! Slap to the face. Hits Amir in the arm, leg and slaps him
j: Sorry to beat you, just that I've been on a beating kick lately. I, uh, beat the game! chuckles
a: You haven't beat the game yet, you have one objective le-
j: I still basically beat the game! You ass! Yeah, I have one objective left, I just can't get 200 coins.

Jake pecks him on the cheek
a: What the hell wa-
j: PRINCE.
Amir takes Jake's phone and starts playing
j: Good height! Start out high on the first jump.
Amir jolts the phone a little higher
j: I do that all the time, man. Why don't you get a cloud touch? Simple, bitch.
a: I am!
j: I call it a cloud much! Because, I do it, muchly. High jump! Except you don't get extra points for jumping high, do you?
a: On this game, yes.
j: Not coins, though! We're looking for coins, aren't we bud! You really are a simple, simple...
a: 201 coins!
j: BITCH! Jake takes the phone and finishes the game
j: Lemme play! Haha! 213 coins! I got 213!
a: I got the first 201 for you-
j: And I got the last 12, okay? I took it home! .. I'm a golden god, and you're a troll named Rod.
Amir starts beefing
j: Sorry, Rod, but it's true!
a: NO!
j: Unfortunately, you are a troll named Rod, and that is your name. And I'd know that because I got 213 coins on my first try, didn't I Rod?
Streeter walks in the room
streeter: Hey, Jake and Amir. You guys didn't come to the all-hands meeting and now Paul wants to see you.
j: You mean Jake and Rod?
streeter: Yeah. Are you making him cry?
a: How can I not cry? I'm a troll and worst part of all.. My name's ROD!
Jake cracks up
jake, talking to streeter: Rod, dude, Rod! I came up with that shit.
cuts to Paul's office
paul: I think you guys now why I'm here. I heard you got 200 coins in Tiny Wings.
j: It's true, I can, not Rod.
a: Nooooo.
paul: Quiet, Rod.
j: Yeah, shut up, Rod!
paul: Shut the fuck up, Rod!
j: Yeah, Rod, who even invited you in here to talk?
paul: Jesus, Rod, just keep your mouth shut for once.
j: Get out of here, Rod!
paul: Who is this Rod guy?
j: I don't even know! His name's Rod!
paul: Did you bring Rod in here?
j: He follows me around!
paul: I'm too busy for Rod's bullshit.
j: So am I, sir!
jake: Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir!
amir: Jake or Amir, you mean.
jake: No, they're not.
amir: Right...
amir: Hallelujah? Nah... holla me. Yeah!
jake:  Hey! Hey, yeah, I was wondering if you could come to that meeting today.
amir: Me?
jake:  Yeah, yeah. In the, uh... junior conference room.
amir: Yeah! Uh... totally. The junior--? Which one's the junior conference room?
jake:  It's at, uh, three-thirty?
amir: Absolutely! Are-- you sure you're gonna want me there? I mean, don't get me wrong, I'm thrilled. I'm just a little... thrown off, is all.
jake:  We could push it to four...
amir: No need! Three-thirty's actually better for me 'cause I have this cardiologist appointment that I'd hate to push...
jake:  Alright. Four's good.
amir: Fine, okay, I'll-- ...yeah, I'll make things work; I'll shuffle it around. I just have this pacemaker thing that I need re-calibrated; it, like-- ah, it kills me.
jake:  Cool!
amir: Cool. Yeah, cool! Nah, you're right. Absolutely. I just-- I'm really close to death, but... totally. What should I bring? This is my first meeting.  A fruit plate? What--
jake:  Yo, shut up, dude.
amir: Of course! I'm just excited about the meeting. Alright? In fact... permission to lead it?
jake:  I'm here. Yeah.
amir: Yeah. Alright, yeah! And I will be there too! I will be there leading the meeting! Then it is agreed-ing.
jake:  Yo, you really have to be quiet.
amir: Don't tell me how to conduct my own meeting, alright? I'm now the leader! And I'm not bringing a fruit plate to my own meeting only to be told how to act by some-- some underling, some college drop-out!
jake:  Sorry, there's just this idiot yelling in my ear right now.
amir: Apology accepted! But if you don't want someone yelling in your ear, I suggest you put down the phone!
jake:  Alright! I'll see you there!
amir: No you won't.
jake: ...What?
amir: What? "What," like I'm not gonna be there? No... "what" like you're not gonna be there.
jake: What are you talking about right now?
amir: Don't worry about it, "bro"!  Go back to watching wrestling, "bro"!  Go back to eating chicken nuggets out of your brother's asshole, "bro"!
jake: Do you think I said "bro" at some point? You're mimicking something you misheard.
amir: Don't worry about it...
jake: ..."bro"?
amir:  ..."bro"! Yeah.
jake: Okay...
jake: Well-- okay, I guess I didn't get the suit memo. I'm sorry about that. Uh, why don't we just jump right in--
amir: How's the heating in this meeting? If you're wondering why I'm asking, it's because I'm... Jake, what are you doing here?
jake: Get out.
amir: Of my own meeting?  Gee whiz, Jake! I'd rather not!
jake: This isn't your meeting, man. Leave.
amir: Treason! This is more than a coup d'etat!
jake: I don't know where you got the impression that you were even allowed in this room, let alone leading our meeting.
amir: Where I got the impression was from you, ya coward! In fact, you guys are all cowards for listening to this snake-oil salesman.  ...Get him. I'm sorry, Jake, but-- guys, get him.
jake: Alright, I don't think--
jake: --Okay, hey--
gonny: O Captain! My Captain! What shall we do with this traitor?
amir: ...Off with his head!
jake: "Off with my head", dude?  G--
jake: Gonny... Gonny, what are you doing-- I-- oh!
jake: Ah! Okay! Ah, I'll leave! Ow, I'll leave!
amir: You'll leave in a body bag, ya Benedict Hey-Arnold! Unless that's not your style, "bro"!
jake: I never said "bro"!
amir: Nyatch oo-wruz ib yadgerg ream--
jake: You don't have to do it backwards.
amir: I wasn't trying to!
amir: Ho-ly wow! Congrats, bud! We're rich!
jake: Alright, I think I'm gonna work from the conference room today, so--
amir: Oh wait-- we're actually not rich at all! 'Cause Zark Fuckernerd has us bent over a table, owning every single photo we've posted to Instagram! I'm sorry, pal!
jake: ...Okay?
amir: "Okay"? No way! Instagram's new privacy policy claims that it can and will sell all of your photos to the highest bidder!
jake: What are you talking about?
amir: What am I talking about? I'm talking about you don't own your shit! Do you have any idea how dangerous that is, okay? That's why I posted this paragraph to my Facebook profile which should stop the bleeding for now while my lawyers look over the fine print. Actually, give me your email. I will forward you this paragraph and you gotta copy and paste it precisely. Otherwise they'll find the fuckin' loopholes in it, I swear to God they will. Those micey, micey bastards.
jake: We've worked together for six years. Do you really not know my email?
amir: Actually, better yet, don't even give it to me, 'cause I fear that my email is being monitored, hacked, or worse: both, by King Zark himself. Yeah, he's all up there, trollin' around looking for paintings and shit, art that I have in my head.
jake: Art in your head?
amir: Yeah! I'm being Thomas-Crown-Affaired by the Facebook dictator himself! Yeah, he's makin' his way into the art museum of my brain while I sleep, crawlin' around, makin' his way out with billion-- nay, million-dollar ideas for paintings and shit?
jake: That's less money, okay? You really think Mark Zuckerberg wants to steal and then sell this photo of you... planking at a candlelight vigil? ...I mean, I don't even know what the vigil's for, but I think no matter what, it's pretty depraved!
amir: "I saw the greatest minds of my generation destroyed by madness. Starving, hysterical, naked, dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn, looking for an angry fix!" Do you know who said that?
jake: Allen Ginsberg.
amir: Amir Blumenfeld!
jake: No! No. You ass.
amir:  It's working! Don't you get it? It's absolutely working! He's pitting brother against brother!
jake: Who is? Who's stealing from you?
amir: Ginsberg! Zuckerberg! All these frickin' Jew billionaires! Don't you get it? I make these Instagram photos for me! I write these Facebook statuses for me, so that if one day, let's say I want to sell them, that should be my money! That's my prerogative; that should be my money!
jake: W-- what are you talking about? What do you think you agreed to--
amir: I'm saying if I want to approach a-- a huge brand, like a Doritos or a Coca-Cola--
jake: They would never buy anything from you. You think they have any interest in your status? "Going to the mall? Nah. Going to the mall high. Like this status and I'll smoke you out."
amir: They like quirky, cheeky, irreverent humor.
jake: That's not quirky, cheeky, or irreverent. It's not even humor.
amir: Do you watch the British Office?
jake: Don't ask me about the British Office.
amir: I'm serious, do you watch the British Office, with Richard Gervais?
jake: You're comparing your desperate wannabe-stoner status with one of the most beloved sitcoms of all time?
amir: All's I know is that last night I had a dream of a painting, and today it's the friggin' logo of the Facebook! Okay? Is that just a coincidence? Are you really that ignorant? Are you really that fuckin' blind?
jake: That's it, dude! That's it! Do something more important with your day.
amir: Fine. Fuck off, alright? Have a good life! Good luck being classless, assless, deaf, and dumb! You know why? 'Cause Facebook's robbin' ya! Instagram's rapin' ya! And Myspace?  It's givin' ya the old how-do-you-do! 
jake: ...Holy shit.
jake: Holy shit, what are you saying?
amir: You know what? Here.  Here you go! You deserve this. Hey guys! Listen up, good news! Jake's now for sale! Make sure to make your check out to Zark frickin' Dinkenberg!
jake: Okay, yeah!  Everybody, actually, while you're here-- this is good-- gather 'round, 'cause Amir's gonna delete his Facebook and Instagram!
amir: ...Hah?
jake: "Hah?" No, right? You found out they've been robbing us blind from the get-go! He's figured 'em out, so he's decided to take the moral high ground and delete both accounts.
amir: Okay, okay. You've made your point. Relax. You'll-- you'll make a martyr of me.
jake: No, really! I really think you should do that. Delete both the accounts, right now.
jake: ...Oh my God.
jake: You're an adult man. You're a grown-up; a fully-grown person. Jesus, buddy!
amir:  What, buddy? I'm sad.
jake: Okay! I'm sorry.
amir:  I just-- I don't want to delete it! It's, like, the best website ever, and-- and Instagram is the tightest app.
jake: Okay, so keep it!
amir:  Okay. Yeah, you're right. And I'll take 'em down from the inside.
pat: Hey Amir, congrats on being the new face of Red Bull!
amir: Noooooo!
pat: Are you planking at a vigil on here?
amir: Hey, please enjoy this very egg-cellent episode of Jake and Amir!
jake: Dude, come on. Stop.
amir: Eggs!
jake: I think I'm gonna work from home today.
rick: Yeah, you're not going anywhere.
jake: ...Rick Fox?
rick: I head you're the, uh, chicken whisperer.
jake: From who?
rick:  Everyone.
jake: That's... just-- that's Josh.
rick: Yeah, I need your help.
jake: What.
rick: My chicken's more than sick.  It's dead.
jake: ...That chicken's fine.
rick: ...Oh my God!
jake: Oh! No!
amir: He saved the goose! What did I tell ya?
jake: Why are you even here, Rick Fox? Did you come to steal more money from Amir?
rick: Actually, dick, I'm here to tell Amir that I'm out of the bookie business.
rick: My beautiful wife,  who is not a chicken...
jake: Didn't say she was. You shouldn't have to clarify that.
rick: She convinced me I need a more honest trade.
amir: Mm. Yeah, that makes sense.
rick: So I'm just here to collect Amir's eight-thousand-dollar quitting fee.
jake: Doesn't sound very honest.
amir: No, it is. Can I PayPal you the money?
rick: Mm. Cash.
amir: Fair.
rick: I've spent all my life obsessing about...
jake: Eggs?
amir: Oh my God.
rick: Why are you always talking about eggs?
jake: I'm not.
amir: You-- no, you are, and it's starting to b-- like, it's st-- it's--
jake: He brought a chicken to the office!
amir: It's-- it's enough, alright? I'm getting really pissed off about it.
rick: You are the only one talking about eggs.
jake: Fine. Fine, what have you spent your entire life obsessing over?
rick: Omelettes!
jake: ...Omelettes are eggs! Omelettes are eg--
rick: What did you say?
jake: Nothing! Nothing, okay? I'm-- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
rick: Say it again. Say it one more time.
amir: Say it to his face!
jake: I don't want to! You're scaring me, Rick Fox!
rick:  You hear that, baby? I'm scary!
jake: What's happening right now? Is that chicken over there your wife? Is that what's going on? You sick fuck!
elisa: Drop him.
jake: Jesus... Thank you. Thank you, ma'am. I'm glad that I'm not the only person here who thinks this guy is completely--
elisa: What did you say about eggs, motherfucker?
jake: God. She's crazier.
elisa: Say it. Say it to our face.
jake: Whose face?
rick: Mine!
elisa: Mine!
rick: His!
elisa: Hers!
amir: Ours!
jake: You know what? Fine. Omelettes are eggs. Omelettes are eggs. It's a fact.
rick: Next you're gonna tell us chicken nuggets  are made from real chickens instead of just being named after them! 
jake: What are you talking about, "being named after" chicken?
elisa: Like an Arnold Palmer isn't made of Arnold Palmer! He's a golfer, not a drink.  I learned that the hard way, remember?
jake: No, chicken nuggets are made of chicken. They kill a chicken, grind up the meat and then shape it into nuggets.
elisa: Come on, baby. Go. Go, go--
rick: I'm a cannibal!
rick:  Baby... I want you to kill me.

jake: 7:45 PM, the All-Nighter starts in another fifteen minutes, and it goes for twelve hours.
amir: Stop hounding my shit, please, okay? I'm pissed, I'm scared, I'm tired, I'm... there...
jake: What? Where?
amir: There.
jake: How are you this tired already?
amir:  I'm glad you asked.
jake: Dude, wake up!
ilana-amir: Holy guac! That nap was more than legit: it was dec'!
abbi-jake: I think that might make it less than legit.
ilana-amir: Don't nitpick my twitpic, ya shit-dick! Now that wit was quite quick.
abbi-jake: Do you want me to get you some coffee? Maybe that would wake you up?
ilana-amir: I'm clearly awake if I'm talking to you, Scooby-frickin'-Don't.
abbi-jake: What are you even talking about?
ilana-amir: Bad Scooby? Nah. Bad Doo.
brian-amir:  Dude, you gotta crack up at that shit! That Scooby-Doo pun? That destroyed at my pop-pop's wake.
nick-jake: Why did you tell it there?
brian-amir: Um, 'cause everyone was sad? Especially me! I was his closest friend! Open casket? Now I can't buy a basket.
nick-jake: Can you please try not to rhyme all of the time?
brian-amir: You just did it!
nick-jake: That was unintentional.
brian-amir: Oh, an unintentional rhyme? Well I'm an unconventional mime,  eating an unpresentable lime.
brian-amir: Eww!-- Fuck you. Crack up at that.
nick-jake: Wh-- you didn't even give me time to laugh at that! You knew that would fail.
brian-amir: Fuck you, fuck you, I'm cool, and fuck you.
brian-amir: Ohh! Oh, it hurts to laugh, it hurts to laugh...
evan-amir: ...And fuck you.
andrew-jake: I-- I think we should ask Sam if you can go home.
evan-amir: Oh, you'd love that, wouldn't you?
andrew-jake: Yes, I would.
evan-amir: Wow. The truth comes tumbling out. Jake's a frickin' anti-Semite. And that just ain't right.
andrew-jake: ...What?
amir: I said "You, Jacob Hurwitz... you're an anti-Semite."
nick: What did he just say?
jake: He's half-asleep, dude. What do you mean "what did he just say"? It doesn't matter.
abbi: Oh, it doesn't matter because what? What, because he's a Jew?
jake: I didn't say that! What are you talking about?
amir:  I'm talkin' about you hating Jew.
ilana: You prick! I know many Jews.
jake: So do I! I'm half Jewish--
jake: Ow!
brian: I don't hit like a Jew, do I?
jake: ...That was anti-Semitic, what you just said!
amir: Get him!
jake: What are you talking about--
jake: Hey! Ow! Ow, quit it--
andrew: I thought you said we were gonna shoot a video.
jake: I'm sorry; I think he fell asleep, so...
amir:  Tear his... Jew-hating face off.

amir: Everybody relax. I am making an old-fashioned citizen's arrest!
jake: What are you doing? Stop it!
amir: I am stoppin' it! I'm stoppin' the war...  on drugs!
jake: That means you wouldn't be arresting me.
amir:  Hello, 911? Yeah, I caught the bitch! He is alive and well, for now! Nah, he's not even an underling; he's the head of this frickin' operation. I just chopped the head off the frickin' snake!  This serpent beast-- yes, I'll hold.
jake: Okay-- hey-- you made the handcuffs too tight, alright? Untie me. Seriously.
amir:  Yeah. Hello?  Okay, so I got a stolen wallet here, a... a-- a burner cell...
jake: That's my wallet, and my iPhone.
amir: ...and keys, that I believe were used... in a murder-suicide!
jake: ...How?
amir: And eureka!  I found it!  We're looking at a kilo, kilo and a half of that Colombian mud!  This is Mexican grade-A shit.  You chose the wrong bull to tangle with, compende?  Okay, here we go: selfie for the Insta!  Hashtag... hashbag.
jake: Where did you even get these plastic handcuffs?
amir: I'll ask the questions here.  Ace Hardware.
jake: You just answered my question.
amir: They're gonna throw the book at you, you know that? And you know what else? I'm gonna let 'em! 'Cause I have a lot of pull in this court system-- don't ask me how or why.
jake: How and why?
amir: A judge ran over my face when I was six! Want to know the saddest part?
jake: That you survived.
amir: That I used to respect you. And now I know the truth about you... you're a drug.
jake: It's a little bit of weed! ...You loser!
amir: If I'm a loser, then I'm the biggest loser! Because truth be bold, I've got a quota to hit this month, and I am very much so under! Ever heard of bein' on thin ice? Well it is springtime, my friend, and I am swimmin' in the shit! I guess you could say I'm up Shit's Creek... with a paddle.
rosie: Hey... enough. Enough.
amir: Ho-ly shit, you must be dumber than you look. I gave you a get-out-of-jail-free tard and you're throwin' it back in my face!
rosie: ...It's oregano.
jake and amir:  What?
rosie: I've been... sellin' to Jake for two years; he says the stuff gets him really fucked-up.  I don't... I don't sell drugs; I don't-- I don't even know where to... fuckin' buy drugs, man.
rosie: I'm a phony.

amir:  Mm-hmm!
jake: Can you not eat in here?
amir:  Oh, barely noticeable!
jake: Hey. Hey, you're in a YouTube video. And-- ...you're an asshole. Oh my God, you're an asshole.
amir: Is it viral?
jake: I think it might go viral; it's you trying and failing to jack an iPhone on the subway.
amir: Bull... shite! I got away with it! That video lies to you; it's propaganda!
jake: No, it's actually not. I can see very clearly: this girl is texting on her iPhone and you just rip it out of her hands; you try to time it just right so you can get out there before the doors close--
amir: Yeah! 
jake: --but no. You thought it was a good idea to turn around and say  "time for you to disconnect permanently", and then wink at her.
jake: How did you think you had time for that?
amir: Frankly, my dear...  I don't give a damn.
jake: You should give a damn, because here you are running around the train like an animal, like a scared rat, trying to burrow your way out of the door, large crowds just forming around you, and then you... you lay on the ground; you start kicking and screaming. I mean... listen to this.
amir:  Fire! There's a fire in here! Somebody please press the emergency brake! I swear to God, there's a frickin' fire in here!
amir: And it worked! ...Yeah!
jake: Right, except finally when someone does press the emergency brake, it just gives the gang that much more time to beat the shit out of you! ...That's not smart! ...That wasn't good thinking!
amir: Yeah, but--  have you ever, like, gone to the gym and forgot your shoes?
jake: ...Like, leaving my house, without my shoes--
amir: Forget-- I knew you wouldn't get it--
jake: Of course!
amir: I knew you would just hang me out to dry, because you love seeing me fail! Right? The Germans call it "schadenfreude".  Americans do too! It's funny: we were enemies for so long, but we still use some of their phrases. C'est la vie!  That's French, but you get the poi--
jake: Okay, focus. Okay? 'Cause four guys are just sitting on your limbs right now, laying you out like a starfish, while every single woman and child on this train is... they're taking turns stepping on your face!
jake: ...You're so hated, buddy!
amir: If you're a hero...  then I'm a zero!
jake: You are a zero!
amir: How'd you like to know that I got a free iPhone out of the whole shebang?
jake: You didn't get a free iPhone! Eight people are carrying you to the front of the train right now, laying you at the feet of the woman that you robbed, making you not only return her phone, but... God, lick the bottom of her shoes, which... you almost seem too willing to do.
amir: Kinky! 
jake: It's not "kinky"--
jake: What the f-- ...they're taking out your dick?
jake: Hey... hey, they took out your dick, they s-- ... they molested you, bud.
jake: You can sue these assholes.
amir: ...Do you think I have a case?
jake: Hell yeah, I think you have a case! This.. herd, with their hive-mind and their mob mentality.
amir: Yeah!
jake: They-- they think the train's under their own martial law?
amir: Bull!
jake: I mean, they're...  they're taunting you! They're flicking your dick, taking turns, and-- and videotaping it!
amir: They were, yeah. Somebody was all like "I'm gonna Vine it", whatever that means.
jake: That's a disgrace. If it's a disgrace, then you've got a case!
amir: You think I've got a case?
lawyer: Did someone say they had a case?
jake: He's got a case.
lawyer: You were disgraced.
amir: I was disgraced. Do I have a case?
lawyer: Did they mace your face?
amir: They maced my face!
lawyer: Where was this place?
amir: A... subway space.
lawyer:  ...What was the race?
amir: That's in poor taste.
lawyer: Is that Ace of Base?

amir: Forget-- I knew you wouldn't get it--
jake: Of course!
amir: I knew you would just hang me out to dry, because you love seeing me fail! Right? The Germans call it "schadenfreude".  Americans do too! It's funny: we were enemies for so long, but we still use some of their phrases. C'est la vie!  That's French, but you get the poi--
jake: Okay, focus. Okay? 'Cause four guys are just sitting on your limbs right now, laying you out like a starfish, while every single woman and child on this train is... they're taking turns stepping on your face!
jake: ...You're so hated, buddy!
amir: If you're a hero...  then I'm a zero!
jake: You are a zero!
amir: How'd you like to know that I got a free iPhone out of the whole shebang?
jake: You didn't get a free iPhone! Eight people are carrying you to the front of the train right now, laying you at the feet of the woman that you robbed, making you not only return her phone, but... God, lick the bottom of her shoes, which... you almost seem too willing to do.
amir: Kinky! 
jake: It's not "kinky"--
jake: What the f-- ...they're taking out your dick?
jake: Hey... hey, they took out your dick, they s-- ... they molested you, bud.
jake: You can sue these assholes.
amir: ...Do you think I have a case?
jake: Hell yeah, I think you have a case! This.. herd, with their hive-mind and their mob mentality.
amir: Yeah!
jake: They-- they think the train's under their own martial law?
amir: Bull!
jake: I mean, they're...  they're taunting you! They're flicking your dick, taking turns, and-- and videotaping it!
amir: They were, yeah. Somebody was all like "I'm gonna Vine it", whatever that means.
jake: That's a disgrace. If it's a disgrace, then you've got a case!
amir: You think I've got a case?
lawyer: Did someone say they had a case?
jake: He's got a case.
lawyer: You were disgraced.
amir: I was disgraced. Do I have a case?
lawyer: Did they mace your face?
amir: They maced my face!
lawyer: Where was this place?
amir: A... subway space.
lawyer:  ...What was the race?
amir: That's in poor taste.
lawyer: Is that Ace of Base?

jake: Don't do this.
amir: Ass.
amir: Okay! Ever heard of a get rich quick scheme? Well these are wet bitch thick creams; ninety-nine ways guaranteed to get us paid ASAP! 
jake: So they are get rich quick schemes.
amir: What?
jake: You said they were "wet bitch thick creams"--
amir: "--ick creams", yeah!  Okay, number one--
jake: What is wrong with you right now? Don't yell; catch your breath.
amir: ...Asshole.
amir: What if we sell gift certificates that you have to accept at any store?
jake: That's just money.
amir: Yeah, exactly! We sell cash, for pennies on the dollar! 
jake: That means you lose money.
amir: But ya gain pennies! 
jake: You have to chill out, okay?
amir: You know how people love juices and smoothies and shit?
jake: I guess.
amir: Okay, so we get a paperclip, put it in a smoothie, drink it, die, and sue the Jew that sold it to us!
jake: That's not where I thought you were going with that--
amir: Well keep up, Jakey! 'Cause my mind's racing at m--
jake: Oh my God! T--
amir:  Okay, okay, okay--
jake: I'm not talking.
amir: --why rob people-- why rob people, when you can change your name to Robert People?  "Hi, I'm Rob People! Pleased to meet ya!"
jake: How does that get you money?
amir: "D'ahh, don't call me that; call me Rob! Mr. People's my dad's name." 
jake: I didn't call you anything.
amir: Why don't me and you, we open up a frickin' pottery store, huh? How's that sound? Some choice pieces at first, but then we'd build up our inventory, start franchising some stores?
jake: How is that a get rich quick scheme? Sounds like that would take years.
amir: That's the first smart thing you've said today.
jake: Don't touch me, dude. I'm dead serious right now.
jake: Why are you this out-of-breath, by the way? I mean, like... you look like you just ran a ten-K.
amir: I'd like to run a 401! Your frickin' retirement fund for a price, but first,  how'd you like to open up a pottery store with me?
amir: Ever heard of a nutritionist? Well I'm an oldtritionist! Pay me to eat a weed!
jake: That cannot be on your--
jake: --list. There it is. "Pay me to eat a weed."
jake: You okay, man?
jake: You want me to call a doctor?
amir: Call a doc-- Call a lawyer! I'm gonna sue whoever put this clip in my throat!
amir: Okay, it's called-- it's called a digital tip jar! For any online transaction you make, the tip jar forces you to round up to the nearest dollar and takes that excess change. It returns it to you at the end of the year so you feel like you're making free money! We make one percent off total transaction costs, which seems pretty negligible, but really starts to add up the more clients we get!
jake: That's actually really smart--
amir: That is a dummy idea I stole from my entrepreneur friend Clovis!  I knew you'd shit on it!  Isn't your face redder than a beet! ...Speaking of beets,  do you got a garden? I'd love to eat a weed.
jake: Want to take a break?
amir: Yeah, great idea. Let's take a-- let's take a hard five, go outside, get some fresh air, come back in here with a renewed sense of purpose to tackle the second half of the list--
jake: Alright, I'm gonna take you to the hospital--
amir: Please do,  'cause at this point in time, I believe that I am, uh...  dead.

paul:  Alright. Alright. Have a seat.
paul: I can't tell you how many assistants I've lost to this password juncture. You're the only one with the capacity for such tenacity and audacity. But more than anything, I admire your veracity.
will:  I think we just found our password!
paul: No.  did you think it would be that easy?
will:  ...Of course not.
paul: Will... how can I put this so your monkey brain can understand it? I need a password that you're gonna forget when you walk out of this office!
will: Sir?
paul: Well-- say I use Veracity8, and then I write a scathing email to my wife about what a baboon my assistant is. Do you think I want you to be able to read that? Do you think I want you to know how big of a chimp you are?
paul: No wonder you chose Banana13! It's your favorite food and your IQ!
will: ...I deserved that.
paul: Come up with something that you'll forget.
will: Corn1228738... B4G.
paul: ...Well, I can't remember that, you big ape.
will: Okay, how about a loved one's birthday? Right? That way you'll remember it, and I won't.
paul: ...Actually, that's perfect!

paul: Finally. Now I can eat my lunch in peace.

amir: Hey, you are watching Jake and Amir!  That was funny!
jake: Why? What was funny?
amir: I don't know...
AMIR throws a pencil to grab JAKE's attention and then waves at him.
JAKE shakes his head.
amir: I'm sorry, do I have swag?
jake: 
amir: And enough said!
jake: I didn't say anything.
amir: Exactly, the fact that you didn't answer right away with an enthusiastic voice yes means obviously I don't!
jake: Yeah, you know what, I guess you don't.
amir: Hahaha...wow that's the nail in my metaphorical -for now- coffin.
jake: Jesus.
amir: I'm a serious jude, I eat at the chillest restaurants, hang out with the hottest guys, and yet I don't have swag! You know why? Cause of my frickin' jew nose and my two beady jew eyes.
JAKE shakes his head disapprovingly, once more.
amir: 
jake: Are you really crying again?
amir: This is so dumb!
jake: Yes! OK, you are 30 years old. People are married with kids at your age and you are crying, okay? You-- you don't wear the best clothes, by the way. You are currently wearing a pair of khakis that you shit in over a year ago!
amir: It was J-Crew!
jake: Wash them!
amir: I am serious dude! I honestly feel like god owes me money at this point for dealing me more than a shit hand. And I am not talking about being paid back karmically, like with a good career opportunity, or a love interest. I am talking about Him! Owing me! Cash!
jake: You self-centered piece of shit.
amir: Yeah.
jake: Prick.
amir: Watch out.
jake: You are a microscopic fleck of dirt, dude!
AMIR makes a "wow" expression.
jake: You are awful, you are an awful ugly person.
amir: Agreed. With two buck teeth and no ears!
jake: You have ears.
amir: Oh, bullshit, you are just trying to make me feel better.
jake: You know, I am not talking about your physical appearance, I am saying your attitude is so negative that it makes you an ugly person.
amir: Yeah, I agree! Also, I have not one, not two, but one infected nipple ring!
jake: What if I just told you that you have swag? Would you stop talking then?
amir: No, because at this point, I feel like you'd just say it to shut me up and it wouldn't mean anything because you didn't say it originally!
jake: You have swag.
Silence. AMIR tries to start a sentence, multiple times.
amir: For real?
jake: Yah.
amir: Yah.
AMIR wears sunglasses.
amir: Thank you. Actually, that means a lot coming from you, believe it or not I, uh,  I don't know, I'm kind of weirdly obsessed with you I guess...hah, so for you to say something like that to me, I don't know--
jake: Cool. It's fine.
amir: I like it, I guess.
jake: Quiet.
amir: I appreciate it.
jake: You are welcome.
amir:  cause I got swag
jake: A few seconds ago--  what the fuck was that?
amir: It was a stupid, stupid song.
jake: Go ahead and finish it. I'd love to see this, yeah.
amir: I made a dumb, cause I thought you'd cut it off, there's no end to it, it's just-- it's like, uh-- I barely wrote it. It's basically like, uh, this and that. The tune is-- I can't do the tune now, because I'm like... about to cry, but the lyrics were the weakest link, they were-- it's so dumb, why do you make me do this? It's hard to say without the tune, which is actually, pretty tight, but I can't do that because I am sad as shit. It was  I got swag... I got swag... Tell the world that--
jake: Does it feel like you have swag?
amir: It actually feels like a, uh, burning sensation in my chestal area! 
jake: That's an infected nipple!
amir: Hashtag swag!

amir: Sorry.
jake: You asshole.
amir:  Gotcha!  Ahh, , bitch!
jake: You unbelievable dick!
amir: What?
jake: Swallow your food.
amir: Swallow your pride!
jake: You just Rickrolled an email thread of people planning a funeral, man!
amir: Relax, dude! it's a meme!
jake: It's a meme.
amir: You're not gonna make me feel bad about this.
jake: ...Why not?
amir: 'Cause it was a joke! Have you ever heard of pushing the envelope? Oooh! Have you ever seen Hall Pass?
jake: Is that a risque comedy?
amir: No, I just realized I rented it yesterday from a Redbox for a buck, and I don't have a place to watch it.
jake: Don't open his email, everybody.
amir: Y'all just got Punk'd! 
amir: Whoa! Who threw the scissors? Not cool!
jake: You know what's not cool, is you replying all to this email thread where we're mourning and planning Amanda Ferri's funeral,  and saying, "I think these flowers are wild and playful, much like Amanda was. I believe these dragon lilies capture not only her essence, but also her spirit."  "They're a tad bit on the pricey side, but she was more than worth it." And then the link is a Rickroll.
will: You monster. You trash man.
jake: Will.
will: I know. It's not my place.
amir: Okay. You know that guy eats his own shit? Why aren't more people talking about that?
jake: Focus.
amir: ...I hope you die next.
jake: Excuse me?
amir:  Excuse you? Yeah, excuse you? ...Yeah, excuse you!  ...What are you talking about?
jake: What did you just say to me?
amir: I said I hope you die next!
jake:  ...And that's okay?
amir: I'm serious, man, and I have a weird premonition about this kind of shit. I mean, look at this last text message that I sent Amanda.
jake: "Sleep well, my sweet angel"? You sent that yesterday, and she died three days ago.
amir: Yeah, but I didn't know that!
jake: Yes you did.
amir: Prove it!
jake: The email that you sent, on the same exact thread!  "I'm so sorry to hear about Amanda. This is more than a shock; it's a downright shame--" that's not more than a shock, by the way. It's just different.  Then you continue: "If you need to smile in this hour of need, I urge you to read about this meme I found called Rickrolling."
amir:  It's called a mm!
jake: No, it's not. You continue: "There are many funny videos online of people being rolled by Rick at inopportune times... actually, that gives me an idea."
amir: The rest... is comedy present, past, and fut--
jake: Oh!
amir: Ohh! ...Aaah!
jake: Aaah!
amir: Aaah!

amir: Alright, trick, don't kill my vibe.
jake: Stop it.
amir: I'm serious!
START
amir: I'm on a bus and, it's going fast and...
jake: You know the only reason we're on this bus is cause you got us kicked off the train for pretending to be a conductor.
amir: That's not how the rap goes.
amir: I feel like busses are for people who can't afford shit. Like whips and shit.
jake: I don't know where you get this false sense of entitlement, but you also can't afford shit.
amir: Yeah well except my dad had an Audi. So thanks for playing!
jake: He had an Audi?
amir: Yeah, he really did, he had an Audi!
jake: Like he used to own an Audi?
amir: No like he leased an Audi. Leased to own an Audi.
jake: What you did was a felony.
amir: Oh no, lock me up and throw away the key!
jake: That's what they would do!
amir: Really? That's bad news actually cause I wouldn't last a day in jail.
jake: You stood outside the train yelling "all awhored," and then once the doors shut you said "Everyone listen up this is an emergency, there's Anthrax on the train, take off all your clothes."
amir: It was a goof!
jake: You're a goof.
amir: Excuse me. I have very thick skin but that was a low blow.
jake: You're a goof?
amir: ENOUGH!
jake: Hey, hey, that's a toddler dude!
amir: This is what's up. This is why I don't needs to rides the bus.
jake: You know you're currently on the bus, which is, you know, not a great place to brandish your eleven dollars.
amir: I flaunts it cause I don't needs it. And I don't give a sh- OH! OH NO!
jake: What are you listening to?
amir: IT'S NIGGERS IN PARIS. NIGGERS IN-
jake: I GOT IT.
jake: The police showed up and you said you were a Jon Stewart type comedian making a point about subway culture. You said you were a political activist rising up against this see something, say nothing bull sheeite. A mix between Che Guevara, Bam Margera, and Dom Irrera. And then you said "I'm part of the sixty-nine percent." And when nobody laughed, you started crying.
amir: Do you know what that means? I feel like if you knew what that meant, the sixty-nine thing, you'd be cracking up.
jake: I know what that is.
amir: Not the number, ass. It's a sex thing. Okay, it's when a girl eats your butt. Sixty-nine.
amir: You're poor. You're poor. Y'all are poor. And I'm a rich bitch.
jake: You're a bitch?
amir: I'm not a bitch. I'm rich.
amir: How's your summer been?
jake: Fine.
amir: Fine. I knew you'd give a fricken' one word answer and I knew you'd say fine, and to prove it, I wrote it down on a piece of paper before I left my apartment this morning. Exhibit A!
jake: This says "Urinals are for pee-pee, toilets are for doo-doo."
amir: Other side then.
jake: It's a bunch of drafts of one liners. The last one being "I'm the sixty-nine percent."
amir: Wrong note then.
jake: Yeah! Yeah it is, I can't believe you thought this said fine.
amir: Wrong note I said!
jake : There's so many words. You thought it said fine? You thought there was a chance-
amir : You already embarrassed me. You already ashamed me.
amir: Raise your hand if you think I have social issues!
jake: You know, can you really not just sit still?
jake: I told the officers you had a personality disorder, and they almost let us go but then you stole a billy club and hit a policeman in the shin with it. You said "Score one for the Hurwitz brothers! If you don't like our power, take it from us with brute force." That's when we were both tased.
amir: Why are you rehashing this shit? Alright, I was there.
jake: I know you were there.
amir: So you don't have to repeat it okay, just move on!
jake: Ok, fine, I'm-
amir: MOVE ON! MOVE ON! MOVE ON!  MOVE ON! MOVE ON! MOVE ON!

jake: Time's up.
amir: Yeah, okay. Sorry.
amir:  Make way, for Shia the Beef! 
jake: Hey--
amir:  Hey, you! Clear the way! It's an A-list star! Yes, you! Out of the way, it's an A-list star!
jake: You just rhymed "star" with "star"?
amir: I'm just flustered because I'm around a frickin' celebutante! Yeah, Shia the frickin' Beef, in the flesh! You're looking at a quadruple-threat, motherfucker!  Film star! Movie star! TV star! And guess what?  He's got an Instagram!
jake: Does he really?
amir: Not yet, but you're looking at a social media team,  and you'd better believe that's top-notch number-one priority.
jake: You know you have an actual job here, right?
amir: Not for long!
jake: You're probably right-- also, how does having an Instagram make him a quadruple-threat?
amir: I don't even know why I'm talking to you right now! You're sitting in the king's throne! Up, or off with your head!
jake: This is my desk.
mike:  I can sit over there...
amir: No! Nonsense, sir! And I'm really sorry you have to see me like this, but please, Jake! Immediately! Get the fuck up! This is Shia the fuckin' Beef!
jake: You know, I think you actually like when he sees you like this. I think you get off on it, 'cause you act this way every single time Mike Fink-- by the way, not Shia LaBeouf-- comes to the office.
amir: "Mike Fink", right? "John Doe"? Okay? We don't have to use alii. We're friends here, and Shia, by the way, you're not foolin' anyone, okay? I can smell Megan Fox's naked box on your bated breath, and guess what?  It tastes good!
jake: Don't do that.
amir: Don't tell me what to do; only one person can tell me what to do, and he's standing right here. 
mike: Yeah, you really shouldn't do that.
amir: Then I won't.
jake: Why do you think he's Shia LaBeouf? Why do you think that?
amir: Chia the frickin' Bean! Get it right or pay the price.
jake: You're mispronouncing it.
will: Excuse me? Mister LaBeouf? I know it's not my place, but could I trouble you for an autograph?
mike: ...Sure...
amir: Now do you believe me?
jake: What, 'cause Will asked for an autograph?
amir: Yeah!
jake: That guy eats his own shit.
amir: Low blow!
jake: How so?
amir: Hell no! Shia, please! Enlighten the man!
mike: My name is Mike, and I'm not a celebrity.
amir: ...Wow!  Ever humble, even though this motherfucker starred in Holes, then went on to fill up Megan Fox's holes! I'm serious, dude! You gotta tell me about that shit! I want the deets! I have such a crush on her.
jake: This is so inappropriate for work!
amir: Wow, Jake's never been to Hollywood, Nollywood, nor Bollywood. And it's clear to me that Megan Fox jumped on your jolly wood, and rode that dolly good!
jake: Will you please let Mike work?
amir: I will! And I'll help him work; in fact, I want to be your Johnny Drama and your Turtle. If there's anything you need, I'm your man. I might be a vegetarian, but tonight... I'm eating Beef!
jake: You're not a vegetarian.
amir: That's actually a good point: we should release a sex tape.
jake: I didn't say that.
amir: No no no, something tasteful at first-- you know, a little kissy-kissy, a little anal-- and then, when people aren't ready for it, boom! We hit 'em with the big one! We're viral!
jake: What's tasteful about kissy-kissy and then going to anal?
amir: Kissy-kissy!  Kissy-kissy!
jake: Anal.
amir: ...Oh.
jake: If anal is tasteful to you, what's "the big one"?
will: Uh, sorry, could I get a selfie?
jake: Hey, Will, what were you eating?
will: Uh...  my own shit, actually.

amir: Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir-- oh! My nose is bleeding.
jake: It's always bleeding.
amir: Yeah, but this time it's, like, for real!
jake:  Ass so frat, we sat at the frat, we back to the frat, we sat on that ass, we back to the frat!
amir: What are you doing?
jake: I got a bid! ...That's what I'm doing!
amir: What's a bid?
jake: A bid is a ticket! A ticket in! I'm a goddamn Greek god now. Okay? I'm pledging a frat.
amir: Why are you pledging a frat?
jake: First of all, can you not do me the disservice? Don't do me the dishonor, the disrespect of calling it a "frat"? Okay? It's a fraternity. Would you call your country a cunt?
amir: My country's a cunt.
jake: Traitor!
amir: You called it a frat first!
jake: Did I? Did I for real though?  ...Don't tell my Bigs. Do not-- dude, I'll suck your dick.
amir: Stop it.
jake: No, I will.
amir: I know. Stop it!
jake: Secondly, being in a fraternity is the highest form of brotherhood. It gets you made, paid, and-- oh yeah!-- it gets you laid.
amir: How does it get you paid?
jake: ...Sorry?
amir: How does it get you paid?
jake: It gets you laid, I said.
amir: No, you said paid, and made--
jake: Made.
amir: ...Paid.
jake: P-- You know what? It gets you paid in pussy. Yeah. That's what it does. Liquid pussy. That's currency in my frat. Okay? My fraternity. You got that? Have you ever hooked up with a sorority girl?
amir: No.
jake: Well you know what? Pretty soon, that's something you and I won't have in common.
amir: Isn't there, like, hazing and stuff?
jake: Holy shit, you really don't get it, do you? Upsilon Upsilon Upsilon doesn't believe in hazing, okay? They believe in the bond, forged by brothers, committing acts of courage for one another.
amir: So what did you have to do?
jake: Eat socks, chug a bottle of absinthe 'till I puked, get whipped on my ass, wear a vibrating dildo around my neck for an entire day, call my mom, tell her my brother was dead, call my brother, tell him I was gay, and me and a bunch of other pledges had to hold each other's dicks in a basement while we walked around like elephants. It's called the elephant-walk and, uh, this elephant wishes he could forget.  I also ate six banana peels--
amir: Jesus! Why?
jake: Because I'm not allowed to question why! Because our bond is tighter than the glue they used to seal my asshole shut before our Triple Chili Challenge. Okay? Because Upsilon Upsilon Upsilon is a global... brand!
amir: Holy shit!
jake: Yeah!
amir: Did that hurt?
jake: Still hurts! Hasn't stopped hurting! It's a third-degree burn, brother! But, um, I can think of something hotter! It's a sorority girl's ta-tas! And-- they're on my ya-ya!
amir: Why, why, why!
jake:  Why not?
amir: No, I was just reading it. Y-Y-Y.
jake: Shit! Dude, that's Dick-Tooth. Give me your phone, quick!
amir: Why don't you just call him on your phone?
jake: 'Cause Dick-T threw it in a river!
amir: You mean Dick-Tooth.
jake: No! It's two different people, ass! Give me your phone, or I can kiss my bid goodbye!
dick-tooth: Holy shit! God damn, Hur-bitch! I thought you was dead! I beeped you, and I got nothing back!
jake:  It is I: Hur-bitch. I am your humble servant; you are my proud master. Your word is my command. You letters are my brand.

amir: Want to know a cute little life-hack?  If you're interested.
jake: I'm actually not interested. And that was very foul.
amir: It'll save you time and money, let alone effort, and... did I mention c-c-c-c-c-c-cash?
jake: You did when you said "money".
amir: Every time I fly, when I land, I'll pen a little complaint to the airline that flew me. You know, I'll come up with something like, uh, "oh, they denied me a drink", "oh, the food wasn't vegetarian"-- whatever miscellaneous hogwash pot-pourri comes to my crazy brain-- and like clockwork, within a business day, they're reimbursing me with a fifty-dollar voucher, a hundred-dollar voucher. I can sell that on the secondary market.
jake: You absolute ass.
amir: And proud of it!
jake: You jerk.
amir: Stop it!  Okay? A-- a "thank you" would have sufficed, for saving you time, money, effort, and let alone c-c-c-c-cash!
jake: How does it save me time or effort? It costs both of those things, and you know, for most people this involves overcoming some kind of moral obstacle.
amir: Well I'm not most peoples!
jake: You say that like it's a good thing; it's a very bad thing. Alright? You're endangering people's jobs.
amir: Enda-- no, more than endangering! I've actually taken a pilot's wings before. I mean he wasn't fired, as it were, but he was definitely forced into an early retirement! I'm actually locked into litigation right now, so I can't speak with too much more detail about what's going on. 
jake: What's going on?
amir: We're nine months deep and I do not have the capital to sustain this frickin' Law & Order: SV-Fuck-U! I have been grilled by several expert witnesses and a lot of professional cross-examiners, and I'm just sitting under oath, lying through my teeth at this point!  I actually broke twice! Yeah, I couldn't even keep a straight face. My own lawyer left the courtroom mid-testimony.
jake: Jesus!
amir: It is a shit-show! I'm so heavy in debt, but nobody wants to take this on pro-bueno! Seriously, I'm two million in the hole, and at this point I have to win the frickin' case just to break even! How is that normal? How is that fair?
jake: You know what? It's fair because it's all your fault! You did this to yourself; you're-- ...dude, you're robbing airlines!
amir: Oh, they rob us.
jake: No.
amir: Yeah.
jake: Don't. Please.
amir: No, have you-- have you seen these fares? They're gouging us!
jake: Don't turn this into some kind of noble cause, okay? You're incapable of having an idea that big.
amir: Have you seen Erin Brokovich?
jake: You're a small-time crook.
amir: Have you seen Erin Brokovich?
jake: Yes, I've seen Erin Brokovich, and you know what? She brought a small town to its feet and a corporation to its knees. You, sir, are no Erin Brokovich.
amir:  Well I'm Erin Choke-a-bitch!
jake: Stand up.
amir:  What?
jake: Stand up. I think I need to fight you.
amir: Why?
jake: Yeah! Uh--
jake: ...put up your dukes, I guess!
amir: I don't know if I want to. This is ridiculous!
jake: I know it's ridiculous, but I think it's finally come to blows, man.
amir: I can't hurt you! I can't punch you!
jake: Aaah! Ass!

amir: My talent is slam poetry, and my passion is sticking it to South America.
jake: Nope. They're right. Boo. Leave.
amir: "Uruguay: you are a gay."
jake: Awful. Mean-spirited, small-minded, homophobic, hateful, slanderous, thoughtless, careless--
amir: "P--" okay-- "Peru: P.U."  And, uh, "Brazil: you can--"  "--go to hil." ..."go to hell." Okay, feel free to not hold your applause to the end.
jake: They're not doing that.
amir: "Nicaragua: I need more agua." ...So.
jake: You know that's Central America, not South.
amir: It's south of America, and I urge you to stay silent until I'm done.
jake: You just urged everyone else to applaud.

coworker 4: Get off the stage, nerd.

amir: I have several more, each one funnier than the last, but just by a show of hands, who wants me to stop?
amir: Okay, who wants me to stop, but sort of sees that there's potential in this idea, and with a mentor and a page-two rewrite, can actually win this frickin' talent show?
amir: Sheep! You guys are all sheep!  Moo, moo...
amir: ...and especially moo.
streeter: Ok-- Alright.  Okay! Well, that was awkward. So, if there's, uh, no other talents, then I think we can declare a winn-

jake: I regret it. And you know, by the way, we're not actually traveling together. I went on a work trip, and when I got to the airport I went to baggage claim and you came out inside my duffel bag. Coiled up in there with two dislocated shoulders, nearly frozen to death. You whispered, "Surprise. Help me. Help me."
amir: Alright man, you said something nice I appreciate it, now stop talking before you ruin it.
jake: What did I say that was nice?
amir: Let's just go to bed okay? Lights out.
AMIR flicks off the light switch, and the episode is in pitch darkness until the very end. The only dialogue is a voice-over.
amir: Aah.
jake: You okay?
amir: Yeah. Just, uh, it's just dark as shit. Trying to find the bed.
jake: Turn on the light.
amir : Awwh!
jake: Turn on the light!
amir: And give up! You'd love to see that!
jake: I'll just turn on my light.
amir: No no no no no no no, I can do this!
jake: Pretty sad actually, that you're viewing this as a challenge.
amir: Either way, challenge accepted, and completed! 'Cause I just found the bed.
jake: Did you think you were pulling the metal faucet of a bed?
amir: Har har HARDLY. Which is why I'm about to turn it off! Aah! It's hot!
jake: Why are you in it?
amir: I thought I had to walk through it to get to the bedroom!
jake: Just turn on the light!
amir: Why? Why, so you could say I told you so?
jake: So we can go to bed, you idiot.
amir: We CAN go to bed. You're the idiot, 'cause I just found it, and to prove it, I'm gonna fall backwards into it, right now.
jake: Don't do this.
Loud thunk and farting noise
jake: Oh, god. Bud? Bud? Bud!
amir: grunting
jake: Oh my god, you sound like a different person.
amir: Missed the bed by a quarter foot. Worry not, crawling into her right now.
jake: My bed. This is my bed, get out, you're wet.
amir: Here we go.
jake: Why are you opening a drawer?
amir: Just getting my bearings straight, loser! Arrivederci!
Glass crashing
amir: Wow, my hand sucks now.
jake: Are you okay?
amir: Yes sir, just a close call. Worry not. Here we go, leaping into bed, one time.
AMIR apparently crashes through a window, lets out a scream, then makes a car crash causing the siren to go off, all while a lady is screaming. The sound of Amir running back up the stairs and knocking on the door is heard. The lights go back on now, we see AMIR in his underwear holding a cat. He's wet and has a bloody mouth.
amir: Room service?
jake: Ass.
amir: No.
INTRO
jake: Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir!
amir: And?
jake: That's it.
amir: Wow, way to be ambitious!
amir: Ha! This is fun. Just two best friends watching hotel television together.  We both cherish this shit.
jake: Nope.
amir: Oh my God, congratulations! It took you thirty seconds for you to make me feel like garbage-trash today! That's a record!
jake: It was, like, three seconds.
amir: And the shit just keeps on... 
jake: "Gumming"?
amir: That's right!  Diva! 
jake: Ow.
amir: Hey, let's go swimming.
jake: No.
amir: Hot tub?
jake: No.
amir: Come on! Traveling with you is such a bore. What do you do, just sit inside of your room and jerk off all day? 
jake: Oh, my God! Are you kidding me? 
amir: So we can't even spank it?
amir: Can I hold the remote now?
jake: You can't hold the remote, because last time you did, you ate one of the batteries.
amir: Oh, here we go, it's story time! Hey children, gather 'round; it's time for Jake to tell us a tall tale! Please, Jake, remind me what happened next!
jake: You know what? I will remind you, because you were blackout drunk! You put a battery in your mouth, you washed it down with an entire bottle of vodka from the minibar, and then said, "I'll take that free ride to the ER now!"
amir:  Hey, room service? Yes, can I get two cheeseburgers, one with fries, one with salad, and can you take that entire order and shove it up your butt? That's right: go fuck yourself! You've just been Punk'd by Ashton Coutchard! Ha, I wouldn't eat your pig slop if you forced me to butt-chug it!
jake: You know they can tell what room you're calling from, right?
amir: Oh, bullshit. They did say 228, but I guarantee that's a lucky guess.  Yup. Jake Hurwitz speaking.
jake: You know, when the doctors X-rayed you, they found more than one battery. They found five or six AA's, a nine-volt, and an entire roll of copper wire.
amir: It's electric!
jake: That's the terrible joke you made on the operating table to deafening silence, as the nurses sawed into you.
amir: Boogie-woogie-woogie. 
jake: You should be dead.
amir: Enough! Absolutely no more!
amir:  Garbage, fake news, reality trash, propaganda, propaganda, the weather channel... Skinemax? 
jake: No! 
amir: You really are becoming a thorn in my side.
amir:  Room service? Hi. Yup, room 228-- no no no no no, don't hang up, that was-- my boy got a hold of the phone earlier, and you know how kids can be. Anyway, we would actually like to order lunch this time. Do you guys have, like, a small seaweed salad? Maybe like a quinoa starter of sorts that you could just roll up into, like, a... like a torpedo and shove up your ass? Like, just shove it up your goddamn ass?  That's right! My name is Jacob Penn Cooper Valerie Blumenwitz and you were just the victim of a Jerky-Boys-style stunt, AKA a flash mob!
amir: Did you Instavideo that?
jake: No.
amir: Ass!
amir:  Hello, room service? No no no, I'm sorry, please, no no, don't hang up, don't hang up. That was my brother. He's going through these-- I actually am calling to apologize. He's going through this, like, pha-- it's not even worth getting into. We actually-- I know this is hard to believe, but we really do want some food. I feel like the boy who cried wolf, but if you can just find it in your heart to-- to believe me one last time, I really w-- I'll make it worth your while. I'll pay you 200 percent.  Gosh, thank you-- thank you so much. I so-- I so, so much appreciate it.  I don't have a menu on me, but if you have, like a-- any spaghetti dish, like a pasta, like a penne vodka, something tomato-and-cheesy, that you can shove up your ass! That you can shove up your goddamn ass!  Hello? Hel-- oh my God, you gotta be kidding me! That's like the third time they hung up on me!
amir: Oh my God, dude, dude, dude, you gotta get that.
amir:  Please, please, please! I'm so sorry for prank-calling the hotel! You really- I don't know what got over me, but you can't kick me out! You really cannot kick me out! I deserve to stay here! You don't understand, this is like a vacation for us; this is like a once-in-a-lifetime frickin' thing--
jake: Just apologize!
amir:  I'm not going to apologize; it was a joke!
amir:  Got 'em.
jake: "Got 'em"? Really?
amir: Yeah.
jake: You just cried in front of a hotel clerk for thirty minutes 'til he got bored and left.
amir:  Hello, room service? Yeah, can I have, like, a soup, and can you shove it up your, your goddamn-- yeah, your goddamn ass. Thank you.  They would. They said they were going to.

INTRO
amir: Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls.
jake: Not enough time.
amir: I was done.
jake: Not enough information, then.
liz: Oh wow, so I guess that's why they call it the blues.
jake: That's great. Alright. Thank you very much Liz, we're gonna definitely be in touch.
liz: Okay.
girl on couch: We're hoping to let everybody know by Friday.
liz: Thank you.
amir: Though if you ask me? We already found our leading lady.
jake: Well yeah thanks again, and could you just let the next person know that we're ready?
liz: Yeah.
amir: We gotta go through the whole dog and pony show of at least seeing everybody, but I assure you it is more than a done deal I think we can all agree. Promise us you'll keep monday open?
liz: Uh, I have a doctor's appointment.
amir: Cancel it. Sweetheart. Please. Okay? You're as healthy as a clam. We will call you.
liz: Okay.
amir: Never. Holy shit, that was awful right?
jake: She's still close enough to hear you.
amir: NEXT!
girl 2: Oh wow, so I guess that's why they call it the blues.
amir: How does it feel like? I'm serious, how does it feel like?
jake: Bad english bud.
girl 2: Excuse me?
amir: I'm serious. I musta been to like, what, a million of these?
jake: You never come to these.
amir: And I've only ever seen one person ever have it, as much as you currently do. Okay? And uh, Elisabeth Shue turned out alright.
girl on couch: What?
amir: I want you to walk out. Walk out right now with your head held high because you just won a goddamn beauty pageant and a talent show all in one.  There she goes, Miss Americ-NO. That was... What was that? NEXT!
patricia: Oh wow, so that's why they call it the blues.
jake: Great. Thanks. Bye.
amir : Not another goddamn step you beautiful bombshell bitch.
jake: Wow.
amir: Yeah, you Jessica Rabbit meets Jessica Biel A-list . Patricia? Do me a favor. Remember this moment. Can you do me that solid? Can you remember this moment? Can you remember this time and place? Can you remember what you see and feel? Okay? Because this is the last second of your life that you are in a goddamn A-list fucking .
girl on couch: Jesus.
amir: Yeah. I want you to take the scenic route home. I really do, I want you to waltz downstairs, go to the book library, the food store, whatever the FUCK it is you do, and I want you to soak in  breathe in that privacy for the last FUCKING time, because after this week, after the people see what the performance that you just gave to us for the first time, and honestly, I feel treasured that I got to see it first, your life, as you know it, is completely changed, and I don't think everybody can handle it but I really think you can. Because honestly? You're a goddamn Elisabeth Shue to me. She is. Like I know I've said it before, but like, now I actually mean it. Thank you.
patricia: Did I get the part?
jake: Maybe, not necessarily. We're gonna call you.
amir: You more than got the part! You got our hearts. Namaste.  And more importantly. We've got toilet paper. For our farts! Thanks Patricia! Ha ha ha ha ha ha, wipeout!
jake: Oh my god, there's actual shit on that bud.
amir: Dammit.
jake: How?
amir: I'm aloof!
jake: That's not what that means, and ya know what dude, can you do us a favor? Please, can you not tell every single girl that they got the part? Because we're the ones that have to call them, and tell them that they didn't. Besides, I wrote Elton John Blows Papa Smurf, okay? You shouldn't even be here.
amir: Fine. Relax.
jake: Alright.
amir : Queen.
jake: What?
amir: Nothing.
jake: What did you just say?
amir: I called you a queen. And you know what? Sure all these girls might not have all gotten the part, but you know what at least they felt like a star for half a minute. And yeah, they'll come crashing back to reality when you tell them the truth, but isn't it better to have loved and lost than to have never loved at all?
jake: Nope. Don't clap. He said it in a cool way but he couldn't be more wrong.
amir : Good news guys. You all got the lead. Every last one of you!
liz: Ugh, what's that smell?
amir: I'm aloof!

intro:
jake: Hey, you're watching Jake and a-OHH AHH YOU'RE BITING ME!
amir: Geez, relax!
jake: I'm bleeding!
amir: 
jake: What.
amir: Good question.
jake: No, do- I didn't start this conversation.
amir: After a year of inner turmoil, some deep reflective thought, and a lot of, um, light soul searching, I've decided to finally heed your advice and delete my reddit account, so... Salut.
jake: Alright man, that's great, and no, no you didn't, you posted nineteen hundred times in the last day. Most recently, two seconds ago, which means you were posting as you were lying to me.
amir: Sorry... what?
jake: You know the last thing you posted was in the subreddit Earth Porn?
amir: Yeah, haha! Sorry.
jake: It's not a good thing, so. Right?
amir: Yeah yeah yeah, what were you saying?
jake: It's a picture of Yosemite Valley at sunrise, you commented "How is this Earth, and how is this porn."
amir: Good question.
jake : "If you wanna blow your nut hair back, check my imgur account" and then the link is a picture of you photoshopped, poorly by the way...
amir: No.
jake: Yes, your face on Ron Jeremy's body's fucking a map of Africa. That's Earth Porn to you?
amir: It's subversive!
jake: It's definitely not!
amir: I'm sorry. I had no idea you were a circlejerking diva, when were you gonna come out of the closet on that one?
amir : Yeah, how long have we known each other that you weren't gonna, yeah, you weren't gonna come out to me? Come on, I'm your best friend, tell me that you're a diva.
jake : Really? Really? That's how you wanna play this? That's how you're gonna do this? Everybody who thinks you're an asshole?
jake: Everyone who thinks you're an asshole for posting mean comments and linking to porn? They're a circlejerking diva, and nothing's wrong with you?
amir: Yeah. Exactly right, I'm glad you see things MY WAY! My way or the highway!
jake: Fred Durst?
amir: Exactly right.
jake: You're a loser, man.
amir: Oh, really?
jake: Yeah.
amir: I don't know if you saw this, but it was trending quite worldwide on twitter, last week, this loser? Went dickless for Michael Chiklis. So. I don't know.
jake: Right, I see that post. Picture of you from a webcam with your dick tucked between your legs? The text on top reads "Saw every Michael Chiklis movie" text on the bottom reads "Went dickless for him." You posted it in a subreddit called Jake and Amir! You know I don't approve of that.
amir: I'm a good guy greg.
jake: You're absolutely not.
amir: I am, I am a good guy greg.
jake: You're a scumbag steve.
amir : Shut the FUCK up! Shut the FUCK up with that!
jake : Is this okay?
amir: No, it's not! Take it back!
jake: You know, you also post a lot in explain it to me like I'm five. Your last three questions were about money, crayons, and eating. Most five year olds understand crayons and eating. A lot of them understand money.
amir: The comments were helpful, and I appreciated them.
jake: How is this helpful? Under your eating post, somebody wrote "OP is a dumbass and a loser. Just let yourself die."
amir: To which I zung'd him back!
jake: You wrote "How does it feel like to make a thirty year old cry? Gentlemen, shower this d-bag with d-votes."
amir: To which society dealt him more than a fatal blow.
jake: They gave him eleven thousand upvotes.
amir: And counting!
jake: You commented on his post "I'd make you eat my dick if it weren't already off for sir Michael Chik. Ask me anytime." Did you even set up an AMA for that?
amir: Didn't need to.
jake: Yes. Yes you do. And, how do you have your dick off for someone? Explain that to me like I'm five. And why would you do it, if you're gonna do it, For Michael Chiklis!
amir: You know what, enough. Okay? I already regret even bringing up the fact that I was gonna delete my reddit account because quite frankly at this point in time, I don't even see me having the huevos to pull it off! I really don't!
jake: If you need a little encouragement, why don't you look at the front page. Where it says "If this post gets ten thousand upvotes Amir Blumenfeld will kill himself."
amir: And?
jake: Got a hundred and fifty.
amir: Yes.
jake: Thousand. Upvotes.
amir: A thousand?
jake: A hundred and fifty thousand. For you to kill yourself.
amir: No, I know.
jake: Like they want you dead. Yeah.
AMIR starts crying
jake: Okay. Of course. Yeah? A little tears?
amir: Yeah.
jake: Crying?
amir: Yeah.
jake: Sobbing?
amir: Yeah.
jake: Thirty years old though?
amir: Uh huh.
jake: Almost thirty one?
amir: Oh yeah.
jake: Alright.
amir: Am I really on the front page?
jake: Yeah, it's on the front page but you-
amir: My name?
jake: Yup.
amir: On the front page of REDDIT?
amir: A hah hah hah hah hah hah. YEAH! WOO!
jake: You're happy.
amir: Today I learned that I'm a pimp and a cool! Upvote me to karma heaven baby!

jake: Hey you're watching Jake and Amir!
amir: Wow! Recording intros without me-
jake: When you're in here
amir: Touche
amir: Hey! What's the capital of Cleveland?
jake: ...what?
amir: What's the capital of Cleveland-
jake: I heard you the first time it doesn't make any sense.
amir: Ooohioo!
jake: Jesus Christ!
amir: Let me answer your question with one of my own.
jake: I didn't ask one.
amir: What was the worst part of my face before the surgery?
jake: Beady eyes, chipmunk cheeks, buck teeth, bad skin-
amir: My Jew nose.
jake: Know what man- stop saying that alright? I never had a problem with your nose.
amir: Well now you're really not gonna have a problem with it. PLease allow me to reintroduce myself, my name is nose.
jake: Ooh!
amir: N to the ose E!
jake: No man! Come on! You're nose is gone! Where did you get surgery?
amir: Well, you know my cousin Leeron, right?
jake: Yes, I know your cousin Leeron.
amir: ...anyway, his ex-boyfriend, Parm...
jake: Wait a sec, Leeron's gay?
amir: Yeah, dude, it's 2013, why is that of note to you?
jake: Just saying, like, he has kids-
amir: Yeah, he has ki- Uh- I'm sorry, no-
jake: No- I didn't- alright-
amir: So gay people can't have children, is that what you're saying? Is that your little agenda?
jake: Can you-
amir: No, I'm serious, if gay people having children freaks you out this much-
jake: It doesn't freak me out-
amir: Then you have a lot of soul searching to do
jake: You know what, I don't have a lot of soul searching to do
amir: Yeah, you really do.
jake: You know what freaks me out? Your face freaks me out-  AMIR: You have to look yourself in the mirror and you have to say: do YOU deserve children?
amir: Because I really don't think that you do.
jake: What happened, to your face?
amir: Parm fancies himslef an amateur surgeon- a, a bone sartorialist if you will.
jake: I won't.
amir: Anyway, I'm in the market for a new schnozz, you know, and the price was right at five-K plus gas.
jake: Gas?
amir: Did I mention that the hospital, was a van?
jake: ...No... How is that legal?
amir: If you thinks it's legal, I've got a news flash for ya!
amir : It's taint!
jake: Aaaah! Thats sexual harrasment!
amir: General anaesthesia, General,  I need no anaesthesia. I was clubbed on the head like a stunned cow before slaughter. I fell into a deep fitfull rest, fevered nightmares of birds eating my face and what have you. But, listen up because this is when it gets real.
jake: It hasn't already gotten real? You were clubbed in a van by a guy named Parm.
amir: I shoot awake mid surgery, you know I guess the club  didn't do the trick. Heh, anyway, long story... shart...
jake: Shower, burn the chair.
amir: I wake up in a cold, cold sweat to the sound of a bone saw cutting through by bone cartilage, nasal cavity deep deep deep into my skull and I'm like, you know what? No! Enough is enough! I take a scalpel, blind old Parm and I am out of there. Unfortunately, for me, I'm too weak, tired, scared and lame to get much further than the front of the inside of the van. Erstwhile, Parm is on in the back, rufflin' around, swearin' to the only Pagan god he believes in that he's gonna have my head in a jar for what I done to him, RE, blinding him with a scalpel.
jake: Was it worth it?
amir: Let me work it, ha ha.
jake: All this destruction.
amir: It was nerf ifinifin when yet and you're not even cracking up-
jake: This carnage...
amir: Yup, a smile.
jake: Yeah, was it worth changing your stupid nose over?
amir: If you're talking about blinding Parm then you should know that he was nearly blind to begin with, okay? If not already there.
jake: You still stabbed somebody! In his eye, right? And- by the way- why would you let a blind person operate on your face?
amir: Oh, speak o' the devil, He he. Parm's hospice nurse is calling me.
jake: Sorry, how old is Parm?
amir: Ninety-three.
jake: Your cousin dated him?
amir: It's 2013!  Hello? Yes, no no no, okay maam, maam I can assure you he was blind as a bat already. You are not putting that on me! Hello-? If Parm wants to talk to me he can talk to me himself. Oh hello Mr Sir. Yeah, you know what? No- you are a chicken, you are a chicken Parm! You are a god damn chicken parmesan!

jake: Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir!
amir: And my lucky number is sixty-nine! 
jake: Get out.
amir: Okay.
amir: Oh! Got a spell of good news in an otherwise... quite shitty week.
jake: I'd say so; looks like your nose is falling off.
amir: I don't have to be nice to anyone anymore.
jake: You're not nice to anybody now.
amir: Yeah, well now I'm rich about it!
jake: ...What does that even mean?
amir: Ever heard of the lottery, jackass?
jake: Yes.
amir: Well I just found out about it yesterday!
jake: Then you know what? You're the jackass!
amir: Either way, I just won the goddamn jackpot! So call me whatever you want. 
jake: Why do you think you won the lottery, jackass?
amir:  Enough with the name-calling!
jake: Can you please--
amir: I'm serious.
jake: --not pick at that?
amir: I'm not trying to! It obviously itches like a bitches!
jake: Okay, well just let it heal!
amir: Either way, I'm serious about the lottery thing, man. I-- I beat the system on that; I really did.
jake: How.
amir: Well, you know how everyone only buys one lottery ticket?
jake: ...No?
amir:  Well I got tree, I got tree, tell the world, that I got... tree! 
amir: Ass!
jake: You know you're holding two?
amir: Ass! Ass!
jake: It's two.
amir: You wouldn't have laughed even if I s--
jake: That's not three.
amir: That's why you're not laughing? 'Cause I said two?
jake: Yeah! Because you know what--
amir: Or is it because-- because everything I say doesn't make you laugh?
jake: --winning the lottery is, like, one in two hundred million! What are your numbers?
amir: Because you have a bias against me.
jake: What are your numbers?
amir: Excuse me?
jake: What are the numbers? We'll check right now to see if you won. First ticket. Go.
amir: What do you mean, "first ticket"? They're both the same "winning" combination on each ticket! Why win one lottery...  when you can win tree?
jake: So you know what three is? Right? 'Cause that one's got three, this one's got two-- you know what? Forget it. You bought multiple lottery tickets with the same combination?
amir: The same winning combination!  There's a difference.
jake: There's not. What are the numbers?
amir: 1, 18, 22, 27, 38, Powerball... tree! As in "I just won the lottery tree times".
jake: Jesus Christ, you won.
amir: I know. I know.
jake: Please, this isn't fair! Alright? You have to understand-- this is the most insanely lucky thing that's happened to anybody, ever.
amir: Not luck, okay? Strategy!
jake: No, it wasn't strategy! Okay? Just-- jump up and down, be happy, at least act shocked. Okay? You noseless ass!
amir: Oh, excuse me! What's that supposed to mean? Is that some kind of dig at my nose?
jake: Yes! Obviously! It wasn't thinly veiled!
amir: I can't handle this right now! I gotta go back to the store and get the numbers on these tickets to match the one on the site!
jake: Great, so they don't match right now.
amir: Not right now! But I have a feeling if a guy who just won three hundred and thirty-three million dollars waltzed in there,  they'll pretty much do whatever the hell he asks them to.
jake: Can you please just focus on getting your face better and stop scratching your nose?
amir: It just itches a lot, okay? But it's fine!
jake: Hey-- hey, it-- but-- no, there's a family of spiders crawling out of there.
amir:  Oh my God!

INTRO
amir: Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir, and if you like that... 
jake: What?
amir:  What? What? What?
jake: What?
amir: Jake, can you get that?
jake: No.
amir: Oh. Thank you! Ass!
amir: Hello? Hey! Hey, no no-- sorry, I was... I was washing a bowl. Oh! No, you're calling about the couch? Unfortunately, she's uh... she is no longer available. Alright. Thank you. Thank you so much for calling. Bye, hun. 
jake: You sold a couch?
amir: No, no no, no, no--  --it's actually a... it's actually a funny story--
jake: Never mind, alright? I don't think I want to know.
amir: Here's what I do: I, uh, put a nice leather couch up on Craigslist saying it's available for free to a good home. You know, I even peppered in some really believable details, like "I'm moving; I don't have a place for it," et cetera, yada yada.
jake: Why?
amir: "Why" what?
jake: What do you mean, "Why what"? You just told me something really mean-spirited and weird that you do, so I asked you why.
amir: Oh!  No, I just, uh, I like to let people down. I like to hear people's disappointed voices, I guess. I don't know if that makes me weird or whatever.
jake: Weird? It makes you borderline psychotic!
amir: Shit... can you get that?
jake: I'm not gonna answer your phone. The dish is clean.
amir:  Ass!  Hello! Hi. Sorry. I was--  ...washing a bowl. How are you? Calling about the couch, right? Alright, well my first question is usually "Why do you want the couch?" ...Oh, your daughter's going away to college and she really needs a good couch?  That's really sweet.  Watch this!  Unfortunately, the couch is unavailable! Yes, it is because of how you answered the question.  No, no, I'm not being cute with you, uh... you really-- you disappointed your daughter on this one. Alright. Okay. Bye-bye now. Bye-bye then. 
jake: She asked if you were being cute with her?
amir: I told her I was being "cheeky".
jake: No you didn't. I'm sitting right here. That's not what you said.
amir: I said that. I said I was being cheeky.
jake: You suck. You really do. You suck; you're not a good guy.
amir: God forbid I have some fun at work!
jake: Yes! God does forbid this! Your reverse prank-calling people, and your fucked-up bait-and-switch with these evil mind games. Using a work phone, by the way! You don't even have the Goddamn courtesy to use your cell phone?
amir: Yeah, because I don't want people to know my personal number!
jake: Right, I get that, but you shouldn't be spending this much time and effort just to piss people off.
jake: Why do you think I'll answer it?  The bowl's clean.
amir: Ass! Ass! Ass!
jake: You are.
amir:  Hey! Oh my God, speak of the devil! Mickey, my friend!
jake: Jesus.
amir: You're in my apartment, Mickey, right? Alright, you rented a U-Haul, Mickey, the biggest one? You got past my doorman, Mickey? You found the key that I left under the floor mat, Mickey? Okay, open the front door to my apartment, Mickey, and you will find a tastefully distressed, beautifully restored, Danish, modern, touch of class for your ass-- there is no couch, Mickey!  It was all a mind game, Mickey! A fuckin' riddle, Mickey.
jake: You know what, that's not a riddle, and did you do one work thing today? Did you answer a single email? Why'd you bring that bucket--
amir: Mickey! Mickey, Mickey, Mickey... no no, you have to get out of my apartment, Mickey. Okay? I'm sorry, but you are officially trespassing, Mickey, and I have a good mind to call the police about it.
jake: You know, you left him a key. That's not exactly trespassing.
amir: Oh. Oh! Oh God, Mickey-- No no no, I can hear-- Oh, I can hear you breaking stuff, Mickey! Please... Mickey, Mickey, I'm begging you, no no no no no-- Ohhhh God, that was the sound of my plasma TV against the tile floor, Mickey! What are you doing, Mickey? Don't do anything you can't take back, Mickey. Oh, Mickey, I'm begging you.
jake: You say "Mickey" so much when you talk to him, it's crazy.
amir:  Mickey! Oh, Mickey, you're so fine! You're so fine, you blow my mind! Hey, Mickey!

amir:  It's a bird! It's a place! No, it's Superman!
jake: "It's a bird, it's a place"?
amir: It's Superman.
amir:  I'm so serious, man. Oppa leads, like, a Halloween-style Gangnam life and you have no love for it? Like... how is that good for Oppa?
jake: I don't care what's "good for Oppa".
amir: Oppa sad. Alright? Oppa leads a... a sad-style life.
jake: Yeah?
amir: Yeah, he really does.
jake: Yeah?
amir:  I have a dream...
jake: That's a Ben Franklin costume, man.
amir: What? No, I thought this was George W!
jake: You crammed so much wrong into so few words.
amir: ...Thank you.
jake: How do you think that's a compliment?
amir:  Do you know why I like to eat brains?
jake: ...'Cause you don't have one? 'Cause your idea of cool is either mean-spirited or dumb, and deep down, you probably hate yourself more than anybody hates you?
amir: ...'Cause I'm a zombie!
jake: Nope.
amir: I'm stretching.
jake: You weren't.
amir:  Oppa... Oppa leads a suicidal-style life...
jake: Why are you laughing right now?
amir: Oppa is confused of himself.
amir:  So this one kind of works as, like, a two-person costume.
jake: How?
amir: Skeleton guy, and, uh... whatever the hell you want to wear! 
jake: How is that a two-person costume?
amir: Oh my God, you're calling me out on all my bullshit today. And I love you for it!  What are you, on your period or something?
jake: You know, your crotch is bleeding.
amir: Aw, shit! Ass!
amir:  Isn't she shocking, yeah!
jake: Why all the costumes?
amir: It's Halloween, ass.

amir: All right.
amir: Oh! There you are.  Where have you been?
jake: I just came over here to try to find some peace and quiet--
amir:  Huh?
jake: ...came over here to try to get some work done, alright? It's the one quiet place in the whole office.
amir: It's only me over there!  Who are you looking to avoid?
jake: Never mind.
amir: Oh! Let me show you a magic trick. Stick out your tongue.
jake: I really don't have time right now, okay?
amir: Come on! Please? Just stick out your tongue. It'll only take a second! We never have fun anymore.
jake: Oka--
amir: Have you realized that?
jake: Fine--
amir: Everyone walks around with their button-up suits--
jake: Hey--
amir: --and suddenly it's, like, illegal to have fun.
jake: Ahhhh--
amir: Oh-- damn it, I'm sorry. I think I messed up. Was I wearing shoes?
amir: Okay. Alright. You got-- you got the point across, you diva! You're overreacting. You're being so dramatic!
amir: Got it!  You owe me one, you little drama queen. Hey, uh, why don't we have a French kiss and we'll call it even?
amir: Oh, yeah!  Oh! Oh, Jake! Tastes like sushi!  Relax, dude. What's the matter? Me got your tongue?  Just joking. Same thing happened to me last week when Leron tried the trick on me. It's actually a lot easier than--
pat: Oh my God... Amir! Amir, oh my God-- Jake! Get off of him!  Amir! Wake up, man. Breathe, buddy! Breathe!
jake: Oh God... where's my tongue, man?

jake: Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir!
amir: Unless...
jake: They are.
amir: Okay.
amir:  Ass.
amir: Question: do you think Peyton Manning gets paid to do these Papa John's commercials, or does he just, like, love pizza and shit?
amir: And no answer from the peanut gallery!  Salut! So I will just assume--
jake: He gets paid.
amir: I know. Never mind.
jake: Okay. For the record, I did answer the question, unequivocally.
amir: I know he gets paid, ass. It just seems real or some shit, like he frickin' loves the pizza.
jake: So you think he did the ad... just because he loves pizza? Not because Papa John's paid him money?
amir: Forget it.
jake: Forget it 'cause you're dumb?
amir:  Forget it because you don't know what the fuck you're talking about... ass!
jake: Stop saying "ass" so much. Okay? You're using it as a crutch, and it's not as funny as you think it is. Just... go back to being the needy weirdo that you used to be. Alright?
amir: In the ads, ass, Peyton Manning is borderline obsessed with these-- these-- these pizza pies! I mean, it-- it's insane, it's sick! He's, like, chowing down on them!
jake: Are you concerned?
amir: He's gonna, like, choke, he's eating them so fast! I swear to God!
jake: Alright, so Derek Jeter rides around in a Ford Escape. Do you think Derek Jeter loves Ford?
amir:  That's what I'm asking you!
jake: Focus on something different, for the day.
amir: Fine.  Eli Manning for sure loves Dunkin' Donuts, okay?
jake: Stop it--
amir: That much at least is true!
jake: --just-- stop! What did I just tell you--
amir: Yes yes yes! For sure, for sure, for sure! Whether he got paid for that ad in-- in donuts or money--
jake: Money! Absolutely, he got cash for that!
amir:  Want to know how I know he loves donuts? Do you want to know how I know he loves donuts?
jake: I resent you pointing at me.
amir: Do you want to know how I know he loves donuts?
jake: You couldn't possibly know.
amir:  The proof is in the smile! ...Dipshit!
jake: ...What?
amir:  Because he's smiling in the ad! Yeah! And people only smile when they're happy. Unless... did I miss a memo? That--  that-- that frowns means happy?
jake: Peyton's smiling in his ad too!
amir: Which means he loves pizza from Papa John's! Mystery solved! That wasn't too hard...
jake: Don't say it.
amir:  ...ass!
jake: The mystery is not solved. Alright? You think Peyton Manning's maybe smiling 'cause he got paid, like, a billion dollars for that ad?
amir: Whoa, a billion!
jake: --million--
amir: Can I quote you on that? No no no, I should email Business Insider, because hey-- that's breaking news! That's, like, the biggest athlete endorsement ever!
jake: Just shut up.
amir: Hey everyone, gather 'round! Big news! Jake thinks that Peyton Manning got paid a billion dollars to be in an advertisement for Papa John! 
jake: ...Who?
amir:  Pa-pa-pa-John!
jake: ...What?
amir: Pa-pa-John!
jake: What is this?
amir: Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa John.
will: Idiot.
jake: Excuse me?
will: Idiot!
jake: Will, you eat your own shit. Yeah.  D-- what? What? What is that face? You eat your own shit. I think that's the idiot move. Also, he thought Peyton did the commercials for free.
will: Peyton Manning owns twenty-one Papa John's restaurants, so he probably did do the commercials for free!
jake: ...Forget it.
amir: Forget it because you're dumb?
jake: Forget it 'cause you don't know what the fuck you're talking about... ass!

jake: Do you want to sit at your desk?
amir: I'm happy.
jake: We just got breakfast.
amir: This was a good morning for me; first in a while, actually. In fact,  permission to hug the shit out of you, sir?
jake: Denied.
amir: Sharing a meal with you was--
jake: You know, I told you not to act so proud.
amir:  Amazeballs! Yeah! It really was amazeballs, for lack of a better term. You know they say breakfast is the most important meal of the day.  Try my life.
jake:  Alright.
amir:  ...Cool it.
jake: What did I say? If you don't turn it into such a big deal, may--
amir: I'm high on you!
jake: See that? That's the kind of shit that makes me not want to get breakfast together.
amir:  You're right.  I'm sorry-- woo! I just--  --I had all this positive energy pent up and I had to, like, let it out in one-- one, one-- one primal scream! But, uh, okay. Now I'm done! We're good--
jake: Okay, you're still screaming. Alright?  Please, just... chill out. You're shaking!
amir:  I'm rather glad.
amir: Pat! My main man!  What'd you do for breakfast today?
pat: Oh! Um... actually, it's-- it's a pretty sad story. Um, as you know, my dad... is not feeling well; he's sick, he's very sick--
amir: I ate with Jake! I ate with Jake, I ate with Jake, I ate with Jake, and I don't care who knows it!
jake: I do. I care who knows it. And you know what? We didn't even eat breakfast together. I was in line at Starbucks and you stood behind me eating loose egg salad out of a plastic bag!
amir:  I love that! Breakfast club is nothing if not ribbing on each other!  Cool it with the name-calling though, 'cause I'm secretly depressed about that kind of shit.
jake: First of all, I didn't even call you a name just now. Second, you're not secretly depressed about anything. You're outwardly depressed about it. The barista called you "hun" and you started crying!
amir:  "Hum"? Like my nose emits a humming noise? Excuse me, but I have a deviated septum about that kind of shit! Where does she get off calling me that, that-- that queen, that diva, that roach?
jake: Why do you think she said "hum"? By the way, you name-call a lot, for someone who doesn't like it.
amir:  I hate it when it's used on me. I like it when it's used on other people... dillweed!
jake: No, I know! I'm just pointing out how hypocritical you are-- close your mouth-- okay? You're dumb, and you're mean, and... and your nose does emit a humming noise!
amir:  And time! Congratulations, you've ruined the warming glow of breakfast by ten AM! Hey, it's a new record, bud!
jake: Look how fast you turned on me. How quickly you went from happy to sad.  From calm to angry.  Is that normal?
amir:  Maybe.
jake: I don't think it is. I think you should just try to be nice, and quiet, for five minutes in a row. Right now.
amir: And then you'll take me to lunch?
jake: Yes. Fine. If you're quiet for five minutes, I will take you to lunch.
amir: You're on.
pat: Sorry, uh-- did you... want to know about my dad, still?
amir: Quiet, dork!

amir: Who wants free comedy?
jake: Ass.
amir:  Alright.
jake: It's not raining outside.
amir: Hey, check this out. I, uh... made my own bread last night?
jake: Are you asking me a question?
amir:  Yeah, I just figured, uh, why not?  I've been, uh, interested in that... kind of thing for a while now, so... ta-dah!
jake: Wow... okay.  Nice, bud.
amir:  Yeah, last night for dinner, I was, uh, jonesing for, like, a grilled cheese sandwich, you know. So I open the door and I just see, like, uh, cheddar?
jake: Just make them sentences instead of questions. Statements, okay?  You're telling me a story; you're not asking me.
amir: And I had, um...  tomatoes?
jake: ...Did you have it or not? I don't know.
amir: I had tomatoes?
jake: Okay?
amir: But hey! No bread, so I, uh...  I open the fridge, and I'm like "You know what, Jake"--
jake: --"Amir"--
amir: --"Jake, today's the day... today's the day you finally... you figure it out. You figure it out, and you get it done." So, uh... let me cut you off a slice, huh? 
jake: You know what? I-- you know, I appreciate the offer. I actually am just not that hungry.
amir:  Come on, please? It'll mean a lot to me if you... try a slice!
jake: No, I know it would mean a lot to you. That's one of the reasons I don't want to try the bread.
amir:  I'm curious to see what you think about it.
jake: I wish you were less curious.
amir:  Whether you like it or not is actually what I'm most curious about!
jake: Right, of course. I know.
amir: Here you go. Careful, it is hard.
jake: ...Why?
amir: Sometimes bread comes out like that.
jake: Ow! Really hard.
amir: Well, it's a work in progress, sure, okay, but there's a learning curve.
jake: This is chalk!
amir: That is uncalled for! It is chalky, to be sure, but there are some redeeming characteristics.
jake: No, like this bread is legitimately chalk! I mean--  --look!
amir: Enough! More than enough, actually, okay? There's constructive criticism, and then there's this-- this-- this-- this-- this poison that you say to me...
jake: This bread is poison!
amir: Do you like it... or not?
jake: Like it? I can't even bring myself to bite into it! This slice alone is the density of a brick! I mean, it's amazing!
amir: Appreciated!
jake: Never a compliment.
amir: Alright, here: try it with some of this homemade jam!  Yeah! Just spread that liberally on the chalk-- or, bread.  Now you have me saying "chalk", ya dingbat!
jake: How?
amir: No-- I don't know how! You said "chalk", and then suddenly I'm saying "chalk" instead of "bread". It's a whole thing.
jake: No, I mean, like, how do you have this? How do you think it's jam?
amir: It is jam! You just press its head against the bread-- not chalk mind you--  and then you use a knife to sort of squeeze its little jam insides out of its anus onto the cha--  bread, oh my God, I hate you!
amir: Here! Here! Give me that-- give me that rabbit jam. I'll show you.
jake: No! I will not!
amir: Excuse you.
jake: Excuse you!
amir: No, excuse you!
jake: Absolutely excuse you!
amir: Give me the rabbit back, my friend.
amir: Hey-- hey! Get-- that guy's getting away with my jam! Get back here, you thief!

amir:  "Top Ten Alternatives to Turkey on Thanksgiving", by Amir Raymond Blumois!
jake: You know, turkey's a pretty important part of the holiday, pal.
amir: It's animal cruelty! "Number ten: Did you know that turkey is a live hen?"
jake: Misinformation.
amir: "That's why I'm telling you... to eat a wren!"
jake: Wouldn't that still be animal cruelty?
amir: "How are you going to have bird love for a pheasant you've never heard of?"
jake: I've heard of a wren.
amir: "Number nine: Feeling swine! What's that jive? Slit that piggy's throat while it's still alive. Come on, bud! Drink his blood!"
jake: Okay, that's more animal cruelty than is already necessary on Thanksgiving.
amir: "Number eight: Would it kill you to put some veggies on your plate? A strawberry, a yam, asparagus, or meat."
jake: Sorry-- which one of those is a vegetable to you?
amir: Asparagus! Asparagus is a vegetable!
jake: Yeah, you also said "strawberries" and "meat".
amir: And "yam"!
jake: That's a root vegetable, b-- fi-- just... move on.
amir: "Number seven: I'm eleven! A throwback Thursday to my tweenage years, when my dad gave me three aged beers. Child Services gave me away, but that very afternoon, gave me right back! Turns out I pissed off all the wrong people in the Clerk's Office. They figured what my dad was doing to me was more than deserved: it was earned!"
jake: Oh my God, that's dark.
amir: "Have you ever seen an admitted child abuser get off scot-free? Yeah, I wish it happened to someone else... and not me!"
jake: Pretty mean to wish that on someone else.
amir: "My dad defended himself in the courtroom, and all he did was stand up, point at me, and say, 'I rest my case.' The loser got a standing O, and then my court-appointed attorney gave him a handy and a blow! Two jobs for the price of fun!"

amir: Right, I know. Just let me finish the list.
amir: Dumbass.
jake: Wow, man. That made me really depressed. You are... such a small coward.
amir: "Number five: Put the car in drive! I'm talkin' 'bout a Whopper from Wendy's and Dunkaroos from the D's! Eatin' it in the backseat of your car alone, because nobody came with me's."
jake: What a sad way to spend Thanksgiving. Alone, eating McDonald's? Which doesn't sell Dunkaroos, by the way.

dave: You piece of shit!
amir:  "Number three: Jake, please help me!"
jake: Did you know this was going to happen?

amir: Ohh! "Number one: What's done is done. I've, I've-- I've-- I've made my bed, and I said what I said. There's... there's a beating that's coming, and it won't do me any good running, so... I guess I'm caught on the can, and I must be a man. Do what you must. I accept your blows."  "Break my jaw; eviscerate my nose."

amir: The only app that's worth a damn on here is 'Grindr', I'm actually 10 for 10 on that shit! Huh, it works perfectly, if you don't mind who fucks you and where.
jake: Has it ever been a girl?
amir: Not as of yet, nay!
amir:  I'm on 'match.com', but it says I'm 0% compatible with everybody!

jake: What do you mean 'where'?
amir: Like an alley... or... my face.
amir: So 'Hinge' is like 'Tinder', but it relies on you to have facebook friends, of which I have none!

jake: Sorry, who's this guy, that keeps on calling you?  'Ryan Don't Pick Up'?
amir: Na, I just met his wife on 'AshleyMadison.com', hu.
jake: The extra-marital affair site?
amir: It wasn't really that site, as much as it was 'Yelp'. She left a not so stellar review on this diner that I frequent, so I messaged her and begged her to open an 'AshleyMadison' account. I gave her access to my PayPal address and eh, she is not using it responsibly! Bitch is bleeding me dry and her husband is threatening me on the daily with bodily harm! I guess that's why I'm single!  Hehe
jake: Yes! It is.

amir : I vant to suck your-
jake : You're watching Jake and Amir.
amir : ASS!
:
Ricky is standing in the board room in front of the staff
ricky: So I think we all know why I've called this meeting.
jake: Sorry Sir, where have you been the last five years?
ricky: Uh, Ibiza.
jake: Okay-
ricky: But accessible via email.
Ricky glares at Jake
jake: Sorry...
ricky: Anyway, the rumours are true, one rather unlucky writer is going to move to Los Angeles to our West Coast office.
amir : California, knows how to farty.
Amir farts with mouth. Silence ensues.
amir: Wow. Okay just cause there's a sombre moment doesn't mean I can't crack wise, can we wax poetic for a second about one-liners and their place in history?
jake: Let's not.
Amir looks incredulous
jake: Alright? We just found out one of our friends has to move across the country.
amir: Not my friend.
jake: What if it's me?
amir: Then I'll kill myself.
ricky: Okay. Now there's no smart way to choose who goes-
jake: Sure there is.
ricky : So what we did is we put twenty slips of paper in this hat that say 'New York', and one that says 'L.A.' We'll pass the hat around and if you get the one that says 'L.A.', you're moving. We'll start to my right.
Ricky hands the cap to Amir
ricky: Obviously, the tension will mount as the hat gets passed along and the twisted game of Russian Roulette plays out...
Amir unwraps his strip of paper which reads 'L.A.'
rosie: The bitch got LA!
The entire board room apart from Jake and Amir bursts into cheers and applause. Balloons fall from the ceiling and confetti is thrown about. Jake looks on disappointed and disgusted at his co-workers as a staff member brings out a cake with sparklers on top. Two co-workers begin making out on the board table. Amir looks despondent as Ricky pops open a bottle of champagne.
amir : When do I have to leave by?
ricky: I don't know, when do you guys think?
The crowd starts to chant 'A.S.A.P.'
three co-workers hold signs that read: 'Hell Yes! He moves West!' and 'Hell No! He will go!'. Jake moves over to comfort Amir but is brushed aside by the celebration. A group of staff members pick Amir up by his chair
amir: Ricky! Objection! Leading the bitches!
will: This is finally my place!
will walks over to amir carrying a plate of faeces as the staff hold up a banner that reads: 'OH SHEESH Y'ALL TIS A DREAM'. Will smears it in Amir's face.
amir : Is this?
will: My own shit? Yeah...
amir : So hot...
will: It's good.
amir: No!
will: Uh huh...
The camera zooms out on the cap to reveal that all of the strips of paper read 'L.A.'
: 'To be continued...'

amir:  Hey you're watching Jake and Amir and you're--
jake: You said you had a good song.
amir: It is a good song!
amir: Well... this is it.  It's more than it, actually.
jake: It's just it.
amir: This is goodbye... it's more than goodbye.
jake: It's just goodbye. And it's just it.
amir:  Wow.
jake: Wow. Yeah, you know, not everything has to be more than something, just to drive your point past home.
amir: You're gonna put me on blast for that?
jake: Yeah. A blast.
amir: Oh? That's a good idea?
jake: I do. I think so.
amir: To blast me?
jake: Blast you on a Tuesday.
amir: On the day I move to The Angels?
jake: I'll help you with your stuff.
jake: Are you kidding me, man?
amir: What?
jake: You were packing for an hour. You have no possessions?
amir: No possessions? There's a sandwich bag!
jake: A s-- yes! Exactly! You have a sandwich bag! You worked here for eight fucking years!
amir: It's odds and ends, mostly!
jake: It's really light! You know, considering the amount of time you spent here, at this desk. No backpack? No bag?
amir: I pack light.
jake: You didn't pack at all! You packed--  --it sounds like grapes and raisins, mostly.
amir:  Enough, alright? Enough.
jake: Right.  "Odds and ends", by the way, is not one word. You, uh... you spelled this more than wrong.
amir: It's been ace working with you.
jake: Man, that was lame. It was so lame. It made me uncomfortable. / AMIR: Ass, ass, ass for not laughing at that? It was a callback!
jake: Okay. It's a deep pull.
amir: I thought we were gullies!
jake: Stop it.
jake: I know it's hard for you to leave, but I thought maybe, uh... maybe we'll do something special, something real big, for our last hurrah.
amir: "Last hurrah"? What are you talking about? Just 'cause I'm gonna be in LA doesn't mean that we're not gonna work together anymore!
jake: Yes it does.
amir: How frickin' so?
jake: How not? You're moving across the country. You're gonna be in a different office.
amir:  I know! But we're still gonna be in the same office... dweeb!
jake:  So you don't know! I just said we're not gonna be in the same office! Don't yell at me that you know when you don't!
amir: Congratulations! Time! You just ruined my last day on Earth here in six minutes flat? No! Six minutes bumpy!
jake: I'm trying to tell you that I'm gonna drive you to LA.
amir: In what?
jake:  In that.
amir: ...What is that?
jake: It's an RV!
amir: We're driving across the country in an RV?
jake: Eight days of adventure.
amir: Just you and me?
jake: Just me and you.
amir:  Wow...  I deserve so much more than... 
jake: What?
amir:  I deserve so much more than this! This-- this... this is your big idea for a send-off?
jake: ...You piece of shit.
amir: Cool it.
jake: No!
amir: What is that, like, a... like a thirty-footer or some little piece of--
jake: It's twenty-two feet.
amir: Twe-- you might as well have rented a minivan at this point! I'm not going Dutch with you on that!
jake: I'm not asking you to go Dutch-- you know what? Never mind, man. Just have-- have fun in California.
amir: No, no no no, come back, come on, yeah, I'm excited. Big adventure. Hurrah.
jake: You're making it worse.
amir: You know what? No no no, this is good. You'll make it up to me along the way.
amir: Oh sheesh, y'all! T'was a road trip!
jake: Oh!
amir:  Whoa! Okay, taxi almost nicked me.
jake: More than nicked you!

jake: Alright, stop it-- You're watching Jake and Amir!
amir: Wow.
jake: Hey.
amir:  Oh hey there!
jake:  Got you water.
amir:  Oh, no thanks. I think I'm good!
jake: That's, like, a pint of 5-hour Energy. I think you should hydrate.
amir: I butt-chugged a Dasani! At the Mason-Dixon line!
jake: We're in New Jersey.
amir: I'm sorry, if I had known you were gonna be a babysitter on this trip, I would have charged you $3.99 an hour and tried to kiss those milky white thighs on your way home!
jake: ...Did that happen to you?
amir: Unimportant.  I've been doing some light map research...
jake: The map's upside-down and backwards.
amir:  Ever seen midnight in Marrakesh? The lights dance on the ocean, and reflect off the anus.
jake: We can't go to Morocco!
amir: Very well!  We'll summer in Cte d'Ivoire, aka the Ivory Coast! Golden sunlight! Silver moonlight! All of it weaving together in a glowing tapestry that tugs at the anus.
jake: Alright, just... chill. Stop saying "anus". Will you name cities in America?
amir: Spain!
jake: Not in America. Not a city.
amir: Maine!
jake: Closer. Still not a city.
amir:  Anal!
jake: And you've lost it completely-- change your mouth!
amir: Why are you being such an ass-cracker, okay? The world is our oyster!
jake: Just-- name cities in between here and Los Angeles, okay? New Orleans. Austin. Vegas.
amir: Pass, pass, ass. Okay? You know, I'm just gonna go to sleep if you're gonna be such a queen roach about it!
jake: I get it. Okay? You're angry,  you're sad,  you're scared.  You don't want to move to Los Angeles--  alright, that's enough with the active listening. Alright? Just let me talk-- but, look, it's happening no matter what, so... all we can do is make the most out of the next week that we have with each other. So what do you say? You want to have a cool adventure, or what?
amir: I love you so much!
jake: Alright, awesome. 
amir: And you? Do you love me, brother?
jake: I think you're pretty cool, and I'm down for this adventure!
amir:  And in terms of love,  where did you land on that debate?
jake: I... appreciate your love. Let's hit the road, huh?
amir:  Let's hit it so hard that we love each other for it!
jake: You're really hurting my hand at this point.
amir: Hurt it so much that it's... lovely?
jake:  Alright. What would it mean, after all that, if I said I love you now?
amir: I love you too.
jake: That's... not--
amir:  Your love is taking me higher! 
jake: A pint of sugar is making you higher, okay? Will you just chill? That's, like, forty-five hours of energy.
amir:  No! Sleep! 'Till!--
jake: Jesus.
amir:  Oh, don't kiss my thighs!

jake: Alright, man! To New Orleans!
amir: B'shanah haba'ah b'Yerushalayim: next year in Jerusalem, my friend!
jake: Cheers.
jake: Not bad, right? Tequila.
amir: I'm blind.
amir: How long before I feel the high?  And speaking of pipes, I'm high!
jake: Drunk, is what you're gonna be feeling, and I think you already are, which is really fast. Most people need more than one sh--
amir:  Shot through the heart!  We should do blow coke tonight. I'm serious, dude.  I know a guy.
amir:  I want to eat drugs, roll face, rage face, suck face, fuck face, starting-- starting with her!  Okay.  Hey baby! You want some beads?
jake: Alright, you know what? That's an eight-year-old boy.
amir: That doesn't matter! If there's no grass on the field, play bald!
jake: Jump.
amir: Make me!  Murder!
amir: My dad tried to kill me, that's a fuckin' problem! My dad tried to kill me, that's a fuckin' problem!
jake: Yeah, you know what? That is a really big fucking problem! Okay? And just... stop being so honest. Alright? It's ruining my night.
amir: Let's play a drinking game! Never have I ever: been happy! 
jake: Wake up.
amir:  Aaaaaa.
jake: Jesus. Just keep drinking the water, alright? Try and sober--
amir: Stop yelling, okay? I'm blackout, obviously!
amir: Never have I ever been to the equator or made anyone in my life smile or proud of me!
amir: Do you think I'm funny?
jake: Don't touch me-- no. You're not funny.
amir: I'm serious! I know you laugh at my jokes,  ha ha ha ha ha, but do you ever, like, sit down a day or two later, and think about something I said, and crack up to yourself? That's the type of shit that you do to me.  That's the type of shit you do to me, I want to know if I do it to you!
jake: Stop it! No, I don't laugh at anything you say when you say it. You think I laugh at something you said later?
amir: Forget it!
amir: I guess I'm a two-beer queer! Just don't tell my dad. He hates gay people!
jake: He sounds like a piece of shit.
amir: Say that again! Say that again, and I will knock you the fuck out!
jake: You know what, man? The shot that I gave you didn't have any alcohol in it. Okay?
amir: Talkin' about my dad!
jake: That wasn't tequila!
amir: You're clearly too high to have this conversation.
jake: Don't don't don't--
amir: Woo!
jake: Alright, now we have to go to the hospital, 'cause you just blew a line of salt.
amir:  Ohh, my sinii! Take me to Mount Sinai!
amir: George Bush doesn't care about black people.
jake: Who are you talking to?
amir: I'm serious, man!
amir: Never have I ever hugged a bitch, been accepted by a bitch, or felt connected to a bitch!  Why do you think that is?
jake: 'Cause you call them bitches?
amir: Ooh, wrong answer. Guess again.
jake: 'Cause you're an asshole.
amir: Enough.
amir: Avert your eyes, Cornholio, Daddy needs a new set of beads! 
jake:  Oh, my God! How do you have such saggy naturals?
amir: I'm actually down to clown with a lady of the night, if you catch my drift.
jake: A prostitute?
amir: A janitor! ...ess!
amir:  We are being boarded by armed pirates! We are being boarded by armed pirates!
jake: I think it's time to go to bed.
jake: Alright, do you want alcohol or not?
amir: I'm good.
amir: And my dad hates me, he's got a fuckin' problem! And he won't return my call, I got a fuckin' problem...

jake: Terrible accent.
amir: Sorry, y'all.
caption: Somewhere in Texas...
amir: You think I can name ten thousand people?
jake: Why did you do that?
amir: Easy. Bill Clinton. Bill Nye! ...Um... what's-his-face. The, uh... fucking guy.
amir: Fucking what's his name?
jake: I'm not gonna give this one to you.
amir: He won an Oscar? And a pretty good one! Scorcheh? ...Mike Scorch, or some shit like that.
jake: Scorsese?
amir: How many is that?
jake: You had two, and then you failed to name Martin Scorsese.
amir: That's it. Scorzizzy.
jake: Wrong.
amir: So, uh...  oh! Duh. My fucking dad! ...Your dad!
jake: What are their names?
amir: I don't know their names. I said I can say ten thousand people! Say!
jake: You said "name".
amir: 'Cause I know their names too!
jake: Fine. What's your dad's name?
jake: Ohh! Come on.
amir: Merith!
jake: ...What?
amir: Mart!
jake: You can't even say the same fake name twice in a row! How impossibly dumb are you?
amir: How about you're the scorekeeper! So shut your trap--
jake: Really?
amir: --and say what my score is!
jake: Okay. Bill Clinton. Bill Nye. I'll give you half a point for Scorsese, and half a point for two dads, one of them being yours, that you couldn't name.
amir: Oh! The... fucking guy! 
jake:  It's still not a revelation. You don't know the name!
amir: The... chick! She's married to the dude! From the house? From the house?
jake: From what house?
amir: The White House! Ever heard of it?
jake: You-- name the President, then! And the First Lady! Go ahead! Should not be hard.
amir: That's five.
jake: How is it five?
amir: Alright, you know what? New game, Hitler.
jake: That's a person. You could have named Hitler.
amir:  Name a card, and I guarantee I can find it in two seconds.
jake: ...Ace of spades.
amir:  Shit! Oh, no! Which one? Which one? Say it again!
jake: Ace of spades-- and time. Okay? Time, I think.
amir: No, no no no no no no no! Give me two seconds!
jake: You already asked for two seconds!
amir: Well congratulations, David Blaine!
jake: Another person.
amir: You chose the one card in the deck that's borderline impossible to find!
jake:  It's right here!
amir: Ooh, impressed much?
jake: That was impressively bad. I mean holy shit, it took you way longer than two seconds, and you never found the card!
amir: Couldn't have chosen the four of clubs?  The one that's staring me dead in the eyes as soon as I flip the deck over? Didn't want to make it too easy on ol' Blumes, did ya?
jake: How was I supposed to know what card you were gonna see first?
amir: You know I've had a shit life, man.
jake: Alright, tell you what. I'll pay for lunch.
amir: Thank you, Mother Teresa.
jake: You know, you've named more people by accident than you could when you were playing the game.
amir:  Ace of spades! Found it!
amir: Also, I thought of a few new names.
amir: Um... Ace... Spade?
amir: Diva, roach, ass! It's-- you couldn't have given me the four of clubs, make it a little easy on this guy, you know?  I've actually had a pretty shit life.
waitress: I'm sorry.
amir: It's fine. It's not your fault, it's just that... why'd you have to say Jack? Those are the hardest little jokers to find!
waitress: I didn't even specify a suit. Shouldn't be that hard. I see two Jacks right there.
amir: Where?
jake:  Hey man.
amir: Hey man. Sorry, one second. Waitress gave me a tough one, actually!
jake: Tell you what, man. I'll play again.

amir: Okay.
caption: Grand Canyon, AZ
amir: That awkward moment when you realize it's not that grand of a canyon.
jake:  She is grand.
amir: And she is canyon. I'm just saying... that awkward moment when you realize it's not that big of a canyon.
jake: Right, it's the same thing. You just said it twice. Okay, you know what? I think I'm gonna go, because I've been out here for two hours, while I can only assume you were back in the RV, rehearsing that line over and over again. I mean, at one point, it sounded like you were focus-grouping it in there.
amir: I was FaceTiming with Leron back in the States.
jake: We're in the States.
amir: And he actually only had one note. It was to add "that awkward moment when" in the beginning, to make it more like a... meme.
jake: Bad note. Right?  Just so I'm clear, you spent two full hours storming your brain, and all you could come up with was coming out here and saying something negative, insulting this this, this, this national treasure, and your shithead cousin's one note was to add a cliche to the top of it?
amir: I'm sorry.
jake: ...Forget it.
amir: No, about everything, okay? I've been acting like a real... a real diva roach for the past seven... eight years.
jake: Don't you think at that point it's not acting like anything, you just are a diva roach? Like some sort of reverse evolution?
amir:  I actually wrote you a note. If I could... read it...?
jake: ...Are you asking me if you know how to read? I-- I honestly-- I'm not sure. I don't know.
amir:  "Thanks for everything. Uh, I know I've been a diva roach, and, uh, while I respect the shit out of you, I rarely show it. I don't know if you've noticed, but I don't-- I don't have a single friend, and my family life is, um... not. You are the one bright spot in my otherwise dismal life, and even though you get short-tempered with me, I know that at the end of the day, you have my back. I just want to say thank you for that. I appreciate you."
jake: That's insensitive.
amir: 'Gramming it. Hashtag: best moment of my young adult life.
jake: Alright. Okay.
amir: Alright. Want to go to LA?
jake: You know what? We've got one more night to kill. What do you say we go to Vegas?
amir: Make is Las Vegas and you're on!
jake: Alright. I mean, it's... alright. Yeah. Yeah, fine! Las Vegas it is! Alright!
amir: No, now I feel like I'm changing your plan. Let's go to Vegas. Let's go to Vegas!
jake: No no, it's f-- alright, en-- ...tell you what, man. You're welcome. For everything.
jake:  Sorry-- the other side of this note says "fuck off, Jake Hurwitz".
amir: I didn't know which way this conversation was gonna go.
jake:  "You rat coward, you only take me on a week-long trip and pay for everything? How dare you! Is that all I'm worth to you, you you you diva roach?"

amir:  Viva... Las Jake and! Amir! Damn it.
jake: Bad execution. Bad idea.
amir: Keep it rolling!
amir: I woke up in a used Bugatti!
jake: We have to leave!
amir: Excuse us.
jake: Yeah, actually, you know what? Excuse us. Can me and Amir talk alone for a second?
amir: Whoa! Anything you can say in front of me, you can say in front of Kat!
lydia: Uh, my name's Lydia.
amir: Sorry.  In front of Kat!
jake: Lydia.
amir: Who?
jake: You know what, forget it. You showed up on the casino floor last night, drunker than I've ever seen anyone.
amir: I was blackout... with my cack out!
jake: Yes, it was. You were wearing a leather jacket, a French beret, and nothing else.
amir: Oh yeah!
jake:  Oh! Warts!
amir: No!
jake: You jumped on the roulette table, instantly pulled your hamstring, but you decided to power through.
jake: You said "I'm the maitre d'! Who wants fish and chips?" You pointed up at the rafters, like a weakling Babe Ruth, you pulled out a flounder or a... or a sea bass or something...
jake: You tossed a thousand dollars' worth of chips in the air, and you hit it across the casino floor like... l-- like you were, like you were playing Tee Ball or something!
jake: Then, you tried to charge what you thought was the mound, and you ended up hitting an elderly Walmart greeter on vacation with her dying husband. Closed-fisted.
amir:  Flounder!
jake: I said flounder!
amir:  You said sea bass! ...Sea bass!
jake: Security was called, but you were covered in fish grease, naturally, so you were able to slip through their arms. The pit boss announced a rousing game of "catch the slimy Jew", and a group of Asian businessmen bet against you, and won, when you ran full-speed, head-first into a Sex and the City slot machine.
amir: That was a classic Samantha move. I'll admit it. I'll be the first to admit it!
jake: There was a deafening crack,  and everybody started to surround what they were sure-- what they hoped, actually-- was a dead body...
jake: ...until you awoke mid-sentence, suing the casino, which I guess is when they upgraded you to this ridiculous suite.
amir:  Thus concludes your tale of woe and worry, but alas, everything worked in the end!  Bubble bath! Bubble bubble bubble bath. 
jake: No it didn't! Security took you up here and started showing you suite after suite, but it was clear that you had taken this... miraculous turn of events for... more than granted! You kept on claiming "none of these rooms are Mac Daddy enough!" Finally, in this one, you demanded to know whether the balcony was stable or not. When the concierge went out there, you locked the door behind her...
jake: ...and then, in a final brazen act of cowardice, you tried to set the room on fire. Unsuccessfully.
amir:  Except I burned my finger, okay? If I may be so bold as to ask: how is that fair?
jake: That is a bold question, but it is actually not fair, because in a fair world, you would be dead.
amir: You don't have to be a roach about it!
jake: Finally, delirious with anger or maybe possessed by the devil, you barrel-rolled down the escalator back onto the casino floor, in nothing but an open bathrobe and a cowboy hat. You yelled "I'm gonna buy a blood diamond worth of blow! Who's coming back to my room with me?"
jake: That's when Lydia-- who, I'm just gonna say this, 'cause you said I could say anything I wanted to in front of her: Lydia, I can only assume you're a garbage-can whore-- came back up to the room. By the way, honey, there's no blow up here. So I'm sorry to disappoint you, but--
lydia: What did you say?  You promised! 
jake: What?  You said I could say anything I wanted to in front of her!
amir: Kat! I said you could say anything you wanted to in front of Kat! That's Lydia! She's a feisty one. This  is Kat!
kat: Did you say something about Lydia, motherfucker?

amir: Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Jake and Amir are parked in the RV on a street in LA
jake: Alright man. That's it. It's been fun...
amir : Later!

Amir takes a picture of Jake with his phone
jake: Do you wanna reflect? On anything?
amir : I liked it.
He makes a peace sign
amir: Deuces.
jake: Hey at least let me shake your hand.
amir: Actually I fear that if you touch me I will crumble to the ground, in a tidal wave of emotion. So, uh, let's not make this any harder than it needs to be.  Peace. Text me.
jake: Ok, I get it.
amir: Get what dude? I am a rock, I am an island, and this isn't sad because I'm not actually thinking about it. Ooooh 
jake: I'm gonna get out of the car.
Jake gets out of the RV
amir: Do what you gotta do but I'm just warning you that we are getting dangerously close to me confronting the reality of the situation which is that out relationship is actually...
Jake embraces Amir

Jake is wearing large women's sunglasses
jake: What are you doing? I put on sunglasses and you put on like the exact same pair.
Amir is wearing a similar pair of glasses
amir: Not the,  not the exact same pair. Your's are yellow right? I can't, yeah they're yellow right?
jake: It's like the idea of putting on sunglasses.
amir: Oh- the idea-
cut to: Jake sitting looking at the sunglasses:
amir : I didn't- yeah I didn't know you invented sunglasses.
jake puts the glasses down and pulls out a small video camera tape, written on it is:

cut to: Clip from 'Jake and Amir: Rubik's Cube':
Amir is sitting at his desk
amir: Only if you want me to solve the Rubik's cube. THAT depends on whether or not...
Jake throws the cube at Amir. It hits him in the nose. Amir clutches his nose
cut to: Jake playing with the cube:
Jake accidently drops the cube and it shatters off screen. Jake pulls out Amir's 'Most Bitchly' badge from brownies
jake : That pin says 'Most Bitchly'
cut to: Clip from 'Jake and Amir: Brownie':
Amir is wearing a girl scouts uniform
amir : Yeah!
Jake cringes
amir: Yeah it does okay? But it's a reminder for me to not be such a bitchly. I'm a little ashamed about it but I keep it on.
jake: Listen to your voice.
amir: What?
jake: Don't let it get to that octave.
cut to: Jake throwing the badge down:
Jake pulls out a gold watch
jake : This is a Rolex!
cut to: Clip from 'Jake and Amir: Rolex':
Jake is sitting at his desk holding up the watch
jake: It's a Rolex, buddy!
amir: You know how you're always like, uh, 'what time is it?' Ha...
jake: I've never said that to you before.
amir: Well it's time for me to get you a new watch.
Jake looks at the watch silently
amir: Fuck off for not laughing at that you diva, you diva little... I'm sorry, you're a cunt!  JAKE: You're an ass, you're an asshole. I don't want this gift from you. You're- I'm- shutup dude!
amir: I'm sorry. I'm sorry for that that was obviously a little too much.  JAKE: You just yelled cunt in the office. How is that okay? Alright, you know what?
cut to: Jake pulling Amir's canyon note out of the bag:
*jake pulls the note out which says:
FUCK OFF JAKE!!
YOU RAT COWARD!*
Jake sighs and returns the note. He gets up and walks away
In the new LA office boardroom. Employees are standing around chatting. Amir enters.
amir : Make way, for prince Amir...
The employees start booing and throwing paper at Amir. Someone pulls a chair out from under him and he falls down. Everyone cheers and laughs. Someone helps Amir up and then spits in his face before another employee staples his neck
amir: Ow! Ow!
Jake runs in
jake: Hey! Hey! Come on! What are you guys doing? This is insane, it's no way to treat somebody on their first day of work. I mean I know you've heard stories about this guy from New York, but, but jeez doesn't he deserve a chance? He took a real big leap of faith coming out here and... the least you guys could do is give him a fresh start.  I know one guy in this office who will.
employee 1 : Loser!
employee 2: Nice! Boom.
The rest laugh as Jake and Amir take their seats at their new desks
amir: You really wanna work here with me? Heh.
jake: Yeah, I do.
amir: ...Pussy.
jake: Sorry, what?
amir: You're a pussy...
jake: Why are you saying that?
amir: I leave you a bag of trinkets and you're to move across the country for me?
jake: Are you kidding me? This is insane!
amir: Oh! A Rubik's cube.
Amir starts fake crying
jake: Oh, shut the fuck up. Alright, tell you what man, the RV is outside!
amir: Enough.
jake: I can move back to New York.  AMIR: No no no no, I'm just joking.
amir: I was just joking.
jake: You were just joking...?
amir: You gotta learn how to take a joke man, I'm serious. I mean, this is LA.
jake: You gotta learn how to give a joke, cause that's rude.
amir: Wow...
jake: What I just did was really nice and then you hit me with the Rubi- you didn't even say thank you.
Amir starts to make beeping noises
jake: Back it up?
amir: Back it up. Absolutely.

jake: Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir.
amir: Did you miss me?
jake: No.
amir: Fine. Jeez. Heh, ouch.
amir: Where the fuck have you been?
jake: What are you talking about?
amir: What am I talking about? You weren't here last week! ...So I assumed you'd be gone forever!
jake: Why on Earth would you assume that? Didn't I make a pretty big deal out of staying here?
amir: I guess not clear enough!
jake: Holy shit, dude. I take one week off... one week off in the last eight years, and you're putting me on blast for that.
amir: Forget it, okay? What... what printer are you connected to?
jake: Printer?
amir:  Printer! What printer are you connected to?
jake: Easy-- ...does it with the Air. Okay? It's a delicate device.
amir: Don't tell me...! 
jake: Is that a sentence, that you--
amir: Don't tell me you're not connected to a printer!
jake: ...I'm not connected to a printer--
amir:  Hi. IT? Yeah, this is Jake Amir Blumenfeldwitz from the fifth floor?  I have a brand new, heavily used 1982 Inkjet printer!
jake: How is that brand new?
amir: Brand new ink!  Sorry.  Brand new ink! Okay? Yeah, the cyan was replaced last week, but the yellow and magenta are butt-old!
jake: So then the ink's not brand new either.
amir:  That's right, I desire to connect. So why don't you come upstairs and hook a printa up!
jake: You know, there's a lot of mouse droppings in there.
amir: That's right!
jake: What do you even need to print?
amir: Travel much?
jake: What?
amir: Boarding passes... asses! Or do you check in curbside!
jake: When is the last time you flew?
it guy: Hey, if you want to print, just select the default printer from the server here.
amir: Oh, okay, yeah, connect to your server? So you can jack my shit, jack my boarding passes?
jake: Come on.
amir:  Soon you'll be... spending cross-cuntinental trips on my dime? Wh-wha-what, Christmas in Maui? Easter in Hanoi? Arbor Day in the Thimble Islands, all care of Dr. and Mrs. Blumenfeld!
jake: How is that your dime, then?
amir:  Let me ask you a question, good sir, now that you're here...
arnold: Who is your daddy, and what does he do?
it guy: This is a company computer. We already have all your information.
arnold: You want to fuck with me?
it guy: Okay, fine. I'll connect the printer.
jake: Hey, watch out, dude. There's a mouse in there.
amir: No!
it guy: Oh, he got me!
jake: Oh, no!
amir:  Oh, it's not a tumor!

jake: Hello, you're watching Jake and Amir!
amir: Wow, hamming it up much!
jake: Jesus.
amir: Diva!
amir: Holy guac! These Bitcoin things are ridinky-donky! I gotta have one, b-b-b-b-b-b-b-bad!
jake: Stop it. Do you even know what a Bitcoin is?
amir: Yeah, the future of everything!  You know "money"? Bitcoin is like "money", but, um... "better".
jake: You're overusing your air-quotes. Why do you think Bitcoin is better than money?
amir: Because it's worth more than cash! ...Ya jackash! One Bitcoin is currently worth four hundred and fifty... cash!
jake: Right, you're using that word wrong. A Bitcoin is worth four hundred and fifty dollars.
amir: Which, last time I checked, was still more than the one hundred  "dollars." that I bought it for six months ago, so.
jake: You know what, man? You are exactly what's wrong with Bitcoin. You and your speculator friends are just treating it like a stock,  hoarding Kingcoin, waiting for the price to go up so you can sell it to the next jackash at a profit!
pat: Jake, sorry... didn't you buy, like, ten Bitcoin a few months ago, when they were selling for twelve hundred a coin?
jake: Yeah, dude! 'Cause I believe in Bitcoin!
pat: Why?
jake: Um, 'cause it's the future of everything? 
amir:  I love you!
pat: How is it the future of everything?
jake:  Oh, um, it's untraceable! For one! Untraceable! 
pat: Meaning...
jake: Meaning it's worth more than cash! ...Jackash!
pat: And how is cash traceable?
jake: And, um, Pat?  It's digital. It's digital.  It is digital. Bitcoin's digital.
pat: How are dollars traceable?
jake: And, um, to my final point:  It is, um, an online cryptocurrency, Mr. Cassels, so, uh... Hurwitz! From way downtown!
pat: Jesus!
amir: Oh-ho, swish!
jake: Hey, Amir! Why don't you tell this pasty Jew what we do to jackashes!
pat: I'm not Jewish.
amir: I am, ya jackash!
jake:  Buddy... I think you should lift me up.
amir: ...What?
jake: I just swished the game-winning three, so I think it's only fair that you come over here, lift me up like a champion, and give me your Bitcoin.
amir: Excuse me.
amir: Uh... okay...
pat: This is absurd.
amir: Oh! You're h-- ...you're heavy!
jake: No I'm not!
pat: This is so weird.
jake: What's your Coinbase login and password? We're gonna sign in, we're gonna move all your Bitcoin over to my digital wallet.
amir: I thought you said you already had Bitcoin!
jake: I did have Bitcoin, and it was in MtGox. It was hacked and now it's gone.  Alright, I made the three. It was from downtown.
amir: You're hurting my back!
jake: Then let me down!
jake: 'Cause you let me down. 
amir: ...I'm sorry!
pat: Hey, Amir, you know, for what it's worth, I'm proud of you for standing up to that, uh... really weird bullying.
amir: That weird bullying was the highlight of my life! ...Jackash!

jake: You know, you actually have a soft spot in your heart because of fetal alcohol syndrome.
amir: Enough.
jake: I'm serious, man. I read the doctor's report. Your mom would drink whiskey on purpose when she was pregnant with you. She wanted to terminate her own pregnancy.

jake: What?
amir: Winda? Or some shit? I don't...  You hit me in the face, dude!
amir: Sorry, I'm weird about violence. I just have zero tolerance about that shit. That really fucking pisses me off.
jake: You kicked my tongue off!
amir: Okay. Okay! No, keep bringing it up.
amir: For the final four, I'm liking UNC and that baby blue!  Can I see you pee, and a baby poo?
jake: Someone should arrest you.
amir: Someone has.  Someone absolutely has.
amir:  To strike me like you did showed a lack of tact, and you came off like a classless ass, and that's the facts, Jack.
jake: For as dumb as you are, you're pretty good at rhyming.
amir: Alright, I appreciate your attempt to mediate and alleviate what you've done to me to date, but it's a little... too little too late.
amir:  Come on, you little pussy! Get... ah! Aw, shit!
amir: Fill out a bracket, huh? I say fack it! Nah!
jake: "Fack it, nah"?
amir: Yeah, fack it.
jake: Yeah? You wanna say "fack it"?
amir: Fack it! Nah!
jake: Then get out! ...Why don't you get out? Leave! You say "fack it"?
amir: Relax.
jake: Right?
amir: Relax.
jake: You want to--
amir: Fuck.
amir: Let's get high. Right now. I swear, my picks will make more sense if we're baked!
jake: Well, they couldn't make less sense currently. You have in your final four Gonzaga, a picture of a porcupine, the number eleven, and jam.
amir: Alright, enough-- Hey! No eating! ...No cheating!
amir:  Stop!
amir: St. Louis, St. Joseph... what is this, a fucking, like, a...  ...I thought this... what is it, like, a-- a fucking... 
jake: Wow, dude. Try to work on these jokes a little bit.
jake: ...Time.
amir: Damn it!
jake: Yeah, dude, so you can't suck your own dick at all, let alone to completion, in less than three minutes.
amir: Double or nothing, okay? Anybody else's dick. Any dick.
jake: Alright, stop it. Stop it. I win the bet.
amir:  Alright, so these are them.
jake: That's it.
amir: Our final brackets. Let me just file them under "E" for evidence! 
jake: Oh-- come on!

amir: I'm sick of this TMZ tweeny-bopper Canadian lesbo ass, dude!
amir:  It makes me want to puke or something, dude!
jake: Dude! Dude, dude! Do your work!  Answer emails.
amir:  Everything Justin Bieber does is a "blunder", and so I think we should send his ass back down under.
jake: Back-- he's from Canada. You just knew that.
amir: Either way, this Mongoloid ass needs to be deported for his actions, or lack thereof!
jake: What didn't he do?
amir:  He's just obnoxious.
jake: That's it?
amir:  He's just a little obnoxious. He just rubs me the wrong way, in a way.  He's a little Johnny Obnoxville.
jake: He's-- ...sorry, you can't deport someone because they annoy you.
amir: This motherfucker is ruining the lamestream media, with these pop-up, tabloid, e-zine, blog, link bait, listicle bullshit! Okay? I can't-- they're just covering his downward spiral; it's disgusting! Look, visit my Facebook wall. I post about these things pretty often, actually, they're--  --they're actually really funny! They're great! 
jake: You just said you didn't like them,  and wow. Buddy, you are a major part of the problem. Don't you think? You post about these stories all the time on Facebook! Your last one just says "Buck Fieber"... nice.
amir: I'm serious, dude. Buck him! Yeah, why does he get all this attention? He doesn't deserve it! Just... just thinking about it, literally all the time, makes me sick to my stomach!
jake: You know, you're giving him a lot of attention.
amir: Yeah, 'cause he's a basket case! He's a car crash, and I can't look away! Also, belieb it or not, I'm... I'mma kind of obsessed with this little fucker.
jake: Of course I belieb that! That's very beliebable.
amir: I have Bieber fever in a way. Okay? Diarrhea and all.
jake: I think you might just have diarrhea.

amir: If you care to join it, it's called, uh, "Deport Justin Bieber Before I Faint"! 
jake: Alright, yes. You definitely just have a stomach bug. Take up a real issue. Alright? Focus on something a little more important than this celebrity bullshit.
amir: Holy shit, did you see this TMZ video of Justin Bieber pissing in a bucket? 
jake: It's really old.
amir: You can actually kind of see Justin's balls in it. It's... it's pretty hot.  I'm sweating.
jake: Yeah, you have the flu! You're pale, you're angry, you're dripping with sweat. Go home for the day.
amir: I'm fine. I'm just freezing, and...  puking a little.

jake: You know what I didn't expect or deserve? To be burned alive. Leave me alone.

amir: Want to know the worst part?
jake: I know the worst part. It was the feeling of the flesh falling off my back, after--
amir: It's that April Fools is like ruined now almost.  Not in a good way, either.
jake: How can you ruin something in a good way?
amir: I'm just saying that I feel like every April you'll be reminded of this little snafu, and I won't be able to play another epic prank on you without this green cloud hovering over us!
jake: Yeah, you know what, dude? I think I will remember this every April. I'll remember this every week, every day, for the rest of my life. I will never forgive, never forget--

jake:  Owwwww, I'm sorry!
murph:  I don't think Amir could hear you.
jake:  Ohh...
murph: Because you were yelling like a bitch.
amir: I guess kinda I could hear him...
jake:  Yeah, he could hear me! Hear that? He said he could hear me!
amir: ...though Murph does raise a good point that it was a little bit masked by, b-- by the, by the bitchly screaming.
murph: So let's try that again, Jake.  This time, without the bitchly screaming.
jake: Weak! I'm so--
jake:  Owwwwwww!
murph: Amir, do you accept that?
amir: I mostly do, but maybe not completely, because he didn't finish the sentence. He was like, "I'm sorr-- aaaaah!"
jake: Man, this is so fucked! Even for you guys! ...It's too dark! I don't like this!
murph: Amir, should we give Jake one more chance to apologize like a man...  and not scream like a bitch?
amir: I don't want him to get hurt--
jake: Good, man! You hear that? He doesn't want me to get hurt!
amir: --though, on the other hand, everybody does deserve a second chance, and maybe another rip will give Jake that opportunity.
murph:  Everyone deserves a second...  chance!
jake:  Owwwww, God, no, no! What's wrong with you, you sick fucking... it--...
jake: ...I feel... I, I... I feel no pain. What are you doing?
murph:  I'm applying warming jelly to your back. Jake, the soup wasn't burning hot... it was freezing cold.  You went into shock, and... we told you your body was covered in third-degree burns.  It's funny, you know? You're always wondering what to expect... maybe you should start expecting what to wonder.

amir: Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir. Who needs Jake?  Where is he?
amir: Oh hey there!
jake: Jesus Christ, dude!
amir: What?
jake: What are you?
amir: Been thinking a bit about poster ideas; thought I could run a few by you.
jake: Poster ideas.
amir: Yeah.
jake: Don't you think we're scraping the bottom of the barrel at this point?
amir: I think I can make 'em funny!
amir: We should come up with a ratings system. So instead of you saying, like, "this is good, this is bad", you'll be like "this is amber, this is taupe".
jake: So taupe is bad?
amir: No no no, taupe is great. Amber is just better than that, and if something is ultimate, it's gray.
amir: It's a poster of Jordan, right-- Air Jordan, probably-- and he's soaring through the sky and slammin' it home! 
jake: Stop touching me.
amir: Pretty--
jake: Pretty unoriginal.
amir: Pretty forcefully. Is what I was gonna say. Don't taint my ideas with your negative shit feedback... Christ!
amir: Uh, it's a poster of dank weed, you know, like sticky bud, and there's, like, a girl in a bikini.
jake: Alright. Taupe.
amir: Pretty good. Agreed.
jake: That's the lowest I could rate it.
amir: Huh?
amir:  Alright, it's a poster of a clock, right--
jake: Don't touch me.
amir: --but instead of the hour marks, it's little beers... except at six o'clock, it's a little ears. 'Cause listen up! It's beer-thirty! And I'm thirsty!
jake: That's the only time that it wouldn't be beer-thirty. It would be ear-thirty.
amir: Amber.
jake: ...How dare you.
amir: See if you can wrap your twat around this one: it's a psychedelic black-light poster for a little band I like to call... the Grateful Dead! 
jake: That's a really horrible face-- and none of these ideas have been original, okay? It sounds like you want to just open up a poster store.
amir: That's actually a pretty dece idea. Maybe a poster store in the front, a cool cafe in the back, and a little spot to put air in your tires if you ride a bike!
jake: God, you're a bad businessman.
amir: I'm not a businessman. I'm a businesswoman.
amir: It's a picture of a ninety-eight-year-old dude on a toilet, right? Caption: "I'm gettin' too old for this shit!"
jake: That one's kind of funny.
amir: Well that one already exists too! So all this shit about me not selling "originals"?  "You're dumb"!
jake: Why am I here?
amir: ...What?
amir: I'm actually on the fence about even pitching this one, 'cause it's so, like, hyper-offensive.
jake: Alright, well, so don't say anything--
amir: But it's a 
amir: ...Taupe.
amir: So it's a poster so shiny and reflective that it shows you a mirror image of yourself when you stare at it.
jake: A mirror.
amir: Yes, Jake?
jake: I didn't say your name. You're pitching me a mirror.
amir: ...Yes, Jake?
jake: Taupe.
amir: Dope.
amir: I can has cheezburger?
jake: Is that a pitch?
amir: No, I'm just hungry, and I was wondering if I can has a... has a cheezburger, actually. I... I hasn't has one in a while, and I was... simply... curious as to whether or not I can has one. A cheezburger.
amir: This one's less of a poster and more of a drink, but it's like a... orange juice and soda water.
jake: That's entirely a drink. You just pitched me orange soda.
amir: I-- it's just that I'm starving, and I feel like I can has... a whole lot of food, but more than anything else, I... I cazn't has a cheezburger. In fact, I... I cheezn't has a cazburger in quite a while, factually.
jake: I don't care what you eat.
amir: I caz hoping I caz has one. With cheez.
amir: It's called the Guide to British Smiles, and it's just famous Englishmen and pictures of their fucked-up teeth. It's like half social commentary, half me just being a little bit of a dickling.
jake: No, you're just always being a dickling.
amir:  Wow. 
jake: Still wrote "amber".
amir: Oooh, I shouldn't has this! I cazn't has this cheezburger! It'll give me bad cholesterol! I can has bad cholesterol?
jake: I think you're has-ing a stroke.
amir: This one's half poster, half beverage. Okay? It's called an Arnold Palmer!
jake: That's all beverage. It's half iced tea, half lemonade.
amir: Just tell me if you like it or not!
jake: It's a good idea, but it's not yours.
amir: Winning! 
amir: It's a 1988 Lamborghini Countach, parked on a hill during a sunset, cherry red! And guess who gets to drive it!
jake: You?
amir: Heck no! ...Me in ten years!
amir: ...Milk?
jake: God-- can I see your notebook?
amir: You'll never understand my scatterbrain!
jake:  Yeah, just page after page of drink ideas.
amir: I can has my notebook back now?
jake: You think you invented milk?
amir: Dad?
amir: Alright, just trying to organize my thoughts here. Would you say your top three choices so far have been psychedelic poster, milk, and mirror?
jake: No.
amir: Okay. That'll suit me well for my first round of funding; the angel round, as it were. By the way, how much could I put you down for? It's a big pie, so feel free to ask for a small little slice.
jake: Zero.
amir: That fucking hurts to hear.

jake: Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir-- and watch out, dude.
amir: Dude, I am watching out, dude!
jake: Look--  ...Jesus.
amir: Learn how to drive, shitbird!
jake: That guy's walking.
amir: Call me a shitbird again. Call it to my face and see what happens.
jake: Can you please just focus. Alright? I said I'd give you a driving lesson if you would focus.
amir: Yeah? Well learning shit is for aunts and dweebs! And last time I checked...
jake: "I'm have a pussy"?
amir:  ...I'm have a pussy. Yeah!
jake: Yeah, you've said that before.
amir: Exactly right. Can we-- ...can we just listen to the radio? Alright? Music helps me drive!
jake: Music doesn't help you drive, at all. You hopped the curb back there 'cause you were listening to a Big Sean song.
amir: I'm sorry if music distracts me! I think that's pretty normal, actually.
jake: Be sorry that you just tried to lie, to get me to turn it back on! Okay? Y-- y--you gotta learn how to drive, if you're living in Los Angeles.
amir:  I-- I--I know how to drive, alright? I'm a regular James Deen.
jake: Jesus.
amir: What?
jake: Jerk.
amir: I can't... you know what?... I can't see anything. I think I need my sunglasses.
jake: Alright, fine. I'll grab them. Where are they--
amir: No, I got 'em, I got 'em, I got 'em.
jake: Hey, hey-- hey-- dude! Hey! Idiot!
amir: I got 'em, dude! I g--
jake: You idiot!
amir: Why am I an idiot? Okay? There's a lot of glare. It'll be much safer if I just find my shades!
jake: Eyes on the road, buddy.
amir: I don't need 'em on the road, buddy! Alright? Relax. I--
amir:  Beware, beware, beware...
jake: Find the glasses.
amir:  ...of a woman with a broken fart! 
jake: Oh! Smelly!
amir: Got 'em, baby!
jake: Jesus Christ.
amir: Pussy-whipped much?
jake: ...What?
amir: I swear, dude. You let women walk all over you. You gotta--
jake: I don't-- ...stop it. Okay?
amir: Okay...
jake: I don't feel like having a conversation right now.
amir: Me neither, so we're both... on the same page, as it were. 
jake: Good, so then we just be quiet, and we don't have to say anything to each other.
amir: Fine.  It's funny... this whole thing reminds me of my old man teaching me how to drive.  Was sittin' in the same seat you were. If you can belee dat!
jake: I can belee dat. Just, please, can we not talk about your family? I--
amir: Cursing the only god he knew that he lost that rock-paper-scissors match against my mommy. "Loser has to teach Queen Dweeb to drive!" That's what they said.
jake: "Queen Dweeb"?
amir: "Queen Dweeb". That was their nickname for me. They used to yell it me, taunt me, throw shit at me like the, uh... what's the inside of a-- of a peach?
jake: ...The pit?
amir: Yeah. They used to throw knives at me.
jake: Why did you ask me about peach pits?
amir: Because you gotta cut the peach with something! ...Idiot!
jake: Jesus Christ, that is depressing. Just... driving-wise, okay...
amir: Yeah?
jake: Just remember to use your signals when we're changing lanes.
amir:  I use arm signals.  Hi-ya! Less legal, sure--
jake: Eyes on the road.
amir: --but... way less effective, too.
jake: So you said "less" twice, then.
amir: Yeah.  Oh, God, these driving lessons. Daddy used to sit right there; me, crying in the front seat like a five-year-old. "I don't want to drive today, Papa! I can't reach the pedals!"
jake: ...Excuse me?
amir: I was four.
jake: God, your parents suck, dude.
amir: Excuse me! Say that again! Say that again to my face and I will drive this car into a cat, so help me cod, you fishy bitch!
jake: Keep your eyes on the road!
amir: I can't see shit, dude! These glasses are not prescription!
jake: Then take them off!
amir:  Let me put them back in the case!
jake: Hey! Dude!
amir: What, dude! Drive, shitbird!

amir: Hey, you're watching a very green episode of Jake and Amir!
jake: Nice one.
amir: What?
jake: So you're not even pretending that you do work for the company anymore?
amir: Work is fun, but I've actually been pretty into hobbies recently, horticulture being the latest. I like... masturbating and shrimp quite a bit.
jake: One of those is a hobby. The other is jerking off, and the third is just a sea creature.
amir: Masturbating might actually be my favorite. 
jake: Yeah.
amir: Do we have, um... a hose?
jake: Why don't you just do your work, for the day?
amir:  Sorry, can I ask you-- how much a week do you spend on produce?
jake: Don't point the s--
amir:  I'm serious. How much a week do you spend on produce?
jake: Alright. Doesn't look like you have a good grip on the shears there, so don't--  yeah, don't gesticulate with them like that.
amir:  I really want to know, dude!
jake: Ten bucks.
amir: Wow! ...Really! That's... that's nothing! ...Where do you shop?
jake: How much did you spend on gardening supplies?
jake: See, at this point, I know whatever you say is a lie--
amir: Nine.
jake: --'cause you spent--
amir: Bucks.
jake: --too long.
amir: Dude.
amir: You know what? I'm sorry, but I'm not going to apologize for having a green thumb!
jake: Oh! Too green! That's infected!
amir:  Believe it or not, I'm actually growing the ingredients one would need to make a salad!
jake: I don't believe that-- hey, man, that smells awful.
amir: It's, uh, basil, ficus... manure...
jake: ...Terrible salad.
amir: Yeah. A lot of salads actually taste like shit, but I hear they're pretty good for you. Here, look.
jake: Ohh, don't! Dude, no!
amir:  This one tastes like horse manure, actually!
jake: That actually is horse manure!
amir:  Sure tastes like it! 
jake: It is it!
amir:  ...What are you talking about, man?
jake: Fertilizer, idiot! You're eating fertilizer!
amir:  And?
jake: And it's shit! You're eating shit!
amir:  So why didn't you say so!
jake:  I did! I am!
amir:  Before I ate it, idiot!
jake:  Why haven't you spit it out yet?
amir:  Because it's good for ya, see?
jake: ...Jesus.
amir: Now if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna have some shrimp.
amir:  And if you need me, I'll be in the men's room!
jake: You can't masturbate in the office.

amir: Mmm. Saving the best for first, I take it.
paul: Uh, okay. Amir, do you want to cast this, please?
amir:  Jake, you'll be Darryl McMillionaire, smooth-talking Wall Street agent with a heart of cold. The only thing he cares about more than money... is cash.  And Sophie, my beautiful little peach, you shall be playing Moira Cunt, a woman so hot, she doesn't have to be smart. And news flash: ...she ain't!
emily: I'm Emily.
amir: You're Moira. From this moment on, I don't want you to break character until you die. You got that, "Emily"?
emily:  Call me Moira!
amir: Who?
paul: Okay, let's get started. I'll read scene direction.
amir: Great.
paul: "Interior: Cash. Day. This motherfucker only cares about money. Darryl enters."
jake: "Oh, hello. Didn't see you there. You know why? I only care about one thing: pussy, money, and cash. And I'm almost out of cash."
murph:  That's good writing.
paul: Uh, "Moira enters."
emily: "The name's Moira. Moira Slut."
amir: Okay, let me stop you right there. Uh, for anybody who's a little bit too thickheaded to get what's going on, Moira Cunt, at this moment in the script, is trying to... mask her true identity.
emily: "I say 'Moira Slut' because I'm masking my true identity."
murph: Very good writing.
jake: "Moira Slut, why don't you get on your knees and kiss my knees? Kiss my tiny little knees."
jake:  Is this sexy to you?
emily: "I won't do it."
jake: "Not even if I give you cash?"
paul: "Darryl holds up a laminated binder filled with every kind of bill. Twenties, fifties, even sixties and seventies. It's all good because it's all green. It's that guap shit that makes rappers' hoes go 'da-na-na, na-na-na, na'. I'd punch my mother in the gut for twenty dollars."
amir: Okay guys, try not to lose your cum, uh, when you read what happens next. I know scripts don't usually get this salacious, but this is the hottest sex scene I've ever written.
murph:  Sex scene! Jake!
jake: It's clearly not a sex scene! We're not having sex!
paul: "Darryl and Moira Clock start going to town. They're going all the way. A salad bowl is on Darryl's head like a party hat. Moira wears an ape mask and nothing else, except a shirt and pants and grandma underwear."
amir: Okay, that's very hot. I might lose a little cum myself!
murph: It's a little too hot, don't you think, Jake?
amir: Who am I to deny this on-screen chemistry?
murph:  Off-screen chemistry!
jake:  On-screen! He said "on-screen", and I didn't do anything!
paul: "Moira Fudge can't take it anymore. She organisms."
emily: "Aaaaaah! Eee! Eee! Eee!"  "Ay, chi, pa-pi, oh, me, li-key, you, long, time! Aaaah!"
jake: "I can't believe my eyes are rolling back in my head. I'm ecstatic to feel this. This is sex, and I am cash."
murph:  That's it!
jake: Ohh! No, dude! No! Come on, dude.
jake:  Look, get away from me, Murphy! Alright? I'll sue you, dude!
jake: Oh God, my knees! My tiny knees!

jake: Anyway, this is a snatch made in Heaven! Alright? Nineteen. Her name is Lod. 
amir: Lord?
jake: Lod. L-O-D. As in she has double-D's. It's French or some shit, and I'm going to french...  ...her tits!
amir: I wonder if I should get Tinder!
jake: I'm gonna stop you right there. I wouldn't do that, just 'cause you're what my Tinder coach would call an app-killer. You're someone who doesn't just get left-swiped; you actually inspire people to delete the app.  You're ugly.
amir: Mean!
jake: Sometimes the truth hurts. You've got to embrace it. I was an app-killer myself before I met Chet, but it only cost me fifty bucks per match to become Mr. Right-Swiped!
amir: Loser! You have a Tinder coach?
jake: Goddamn right I do.
amir: How many matches have you gotten?
jake:  Just the one. Just the one so far, but I've only been right-swiping for a year.
amir: Long time.
jake: The trick? Shirtless pics! That's right, a topless pic for this thick dick makes the chicks--
amir: Oh.
amir: Oh!
amir: Why?
jake: ...sick!
amir: Holy shit. How?
jake:  I fingered a cat, dude! At a shelter!

amir: ...She's a bot.
jake: What the fuck did you just say?
amir: ...I mean, it's clear to me--
jake: Whoa, buddy! What the fuck did you just say about my girlfriend?
amir: These photos are of--
JAKE I'm gonna tell you one thing right now, before you say what I think you're about to say. This "bot", as you're gonna callously call her? She might be my future wife, and the mother to my future children! So please, I beg of you, actually I demand of you, to proceed with reverence.
amir: All--
jake: Tread lightly. Fucker.
amir: All these photos are of different strippers.
jake: Meaning?
amir: Meaning, this one's blonde. This one's a redhead. This one's Asian!
jake: Yeah! Lod keeps you guessing, man. That's why I dig her. Plus we really connected over chat! Things got real!
amir: Yeah, she wrote "Hey, cutie. Want to see me tonight? Go to livecamgirlwhores.co.nz and enter your billing info."
jake: Yes! I kind of like when girls ask for what they want. I think that's sexy. Maybe you disagree.
amir: You responded "I don't have a credit card. Can I PayPal or Venmo you? I think this could be the real deal, and I'd hate to lose you over a technicality, Lod."
jake: Sorry for me telling her what I want too!
amir: She responds "Sorry, cutie. No cash. Need billing info."
jake: Fair.
amir: You write "Shit, shit, shit. Okay, calling my dad. Do not hang up, please."
jake: I was worried about losing her.
amir: She writes "Don't worry, cutie. This is a text conversation. There is no hanging up."
jake: She's there for me when I'm feeling weak.
amir: Alright...
jake: By the way, I resent the implication that I'm not good at texting. I'm a Casanova in that regard.
amir: Yeah, you finally respond "My dad yelled at me, but I cried, cried, cried, and my mommy was able to make things right by snagging a pic of Dad's CC."
jake: There we go. Everything's right in the world.
amir: "Sending you some major coin as we squeak."
jake: She deserved it.
amir: She says nothing!
jake: Didn't have to.
amir: You write again "I love you."
jake: 'Cause I do.
amir: She said nothing.
jake: Didn't have to.
amir: You write "I love you so much, Lod."
jake: I do. I love her so much.
amir: She says nothing.
jake: Didn't have to.
amir: Okay, 'cause then you said "I'll see you tonight on the cam. I love you so much, Lod."
jake: What don't you understand, dude? She's playing hard to wet!
amir: She just wrote back "Can't do tonight, cutie."
jake: What?
amir: "I withdrew a thousand dollars from the account as a holding fee for next week."
jake: No...
amir: Yeah.
jake: No!
amir: Yes.
jake: Lod!
amir: What?
jake: Why, Lod?

jake: Don't have time for that.

jake: You know, just--
amir: Sharing that!
jake: Can you stop taking the online personality quizzes?
amir:  I got Helvetica! What font are you, you dingbat?
jake: Don't talk to me like that. Alright? You change moods so quickly, it's obviously a problem. Right? A version of psychosis, I think.
amir:  Here! Here, I'm gonna post it to my news feed!
jake: Perfect example.
amir: That way, you can click on the link and take the quiz yourself!
jake: Alright, do me a favor: don't say "here". Don't say "here" like you're doing me a favor. You post literally all of them to your news feed.
amir:  I can't help it if they're viral!
jake: Get a different face.
amir: ...Ouch.
jake: That's one thing you can help, by the way: if they're viral. You don't have to share them.  "I got Spiro Agnew! Which Vice President are you?"
amir:  Yeah!
jake: "I got the nine of spades! Which card are you?"
amir:  Yeah!
jake: "I got a matzoh ball! What ethnic food are you?"
amir:  Yeah!
jake: These are all so dumb; the last one's straight-up racist.
amir: Actually working on a quiz of my own at the moment, if you're down to give it a shot.  Would love some feedback. "What bean are you?"
jake: ..."What bean are you?"
amir: Good question! ...Leema!
jake: I was repeating the title in disbelief-- it's "lima", by the way. You're mispronouncing the bean you think you are. What possible questions could even exist on that quiz?
amir: Question the first...
jake: Never mind. Forget I asked.
amir: "When you walk into a club, a techno, trip-hop, euro-synth style pub, are you A: Down to clown like a kidney bean, all high and mighty."
jake: Weird.
amir: "B: Black bean style, muy caliente from head to toe. You're sexy and I know it."
jake: Racist.
amir: "C: Chickpea, or D: Leema."
jake: "Lima"!
amir: Question the...  ...two...
jake: Second! Oh, God, I'm sad for you.
amir:  "Which nineties fem teen trend would you most align yourself with, bean-wise?"
jake: You know, you haven't responded to a work email in a year. Do you mind if I bring that up?
amir: "A: Kidney bean slap bracelets."
jake: Yup, just found the date of the last email you sent. May 2013. About a memorial service for Kunal Shah, that programmer who died? You wrote, "LOL! Not going to this. Who wants to join me for all you can wings and beer at anywhere-but-there bar."
amir: "B: Black bean style locker photos of Jonathan Brandis."
amir:  "C: Chickpea-Chee folders, or D: Jared Leto AKA Jordan Catalano AKA leema beans--" what song are you listening to that's more important than this quiz?
jake:  I'm on Spotify. I could listen to almost any song and they'd all be more important. Why take these moronic quizzes? Why broadcast the results?
amir:  It's gonna sound stupid, but they help me project a self-image I didn't even know that I had! ...In this increasingly anonymous world of modern technology, these "quizzes" give us the only thing that any of us truly wants, which is... an identity.  ...Regardless of how... sophomoric it sounds on the surface, I truly believe that the hardest thing for any one person to know is themselves.
jake:  ...Okay.
amir: Oh!  I got "soft-serve"! "What kind of doo-doo are you? Shit-wise!"

amir:  Ohhh, yeah!  Oh! Did I tell you I'm doing a gluten-free June? Nothing too drastic. Just like a... gastric bypass, maybe a tummy-tuck, and a... a face lift.
jake: "Nothing too drastic"? You're talking about... surgery! Invasive, elective surgery!
amir: Chill with that shit.
jake: Meatballs on your keyboard.
amir: Ahhh, crap!
amir: Ahhh, double crap!
jake: Try to do things quietly.
amir:  Yo yo yo, DJ Shmumu on the house! In the line, and turnin' it up! How's down, my playa?
jake: Dude. So bad.
amir: Sounds awesome! Let me just check with my secretary!  Hey, do we have work on Wednesday the 25th?
jake: I'm not your secretary-- and... come on, of course. We have work every Wednesday--
amir: Can do! Pencil this DJ...! Up? 
jake: Not smart. Just gonna confuse him.
amir: You'll never in a million years guess what I've been doing lately.
jake: Starting a DJ business.
amir: Better. Starting a DJ business.
jake: That's what I guessed. Why have a conversation with you if you're just gonna--
amir:  Good question! Business is booming!
jake: Can you please not shake so much? Just contain the excitement. You enter every single conversation with an agenda, so, like, no matter what direction it goes--
amir: Business is booming. I'm happy; you're happy for me!  I'm doing everything right now pro bono, but that doesn't mean I'm not makin' bank! 
jake: Yes it does! If you're using "pro bono" correctly.
amir: I can't help it if my Yelp reviews suck!
jake: That's one thing you can help! The reviews suck if you suck! So you improve yourself!
amir:  Wow.
jake: I'm looking at them right now. "DJ Shmumu pressed 'play' on a Spotify playlist and fainted."
amir: Yeah!
jake: "DJ Shmumu fainted upon arrival!"
amir: Yeah!
jake: "He woke up and tried to load a Spotify playlist, but promptly fainted again!"
amir: Yeah!
jake: Stop saying "yeah"! You shouldn't be fainting this much.
amir: Whoa, dude!
jake: Oh my God.
amir: I just blacked out for a spell...
jake: You fainted!
amir: Ohh!
jake: Sleep more. Get a better diet.
amir:  I'm gluten-free!
jake: ...On second thought, man, just let yourself die.
amir: Ouch much?  That hurt more than my last Yelp review!
jake: Right, which it looks like you wrote thirty seconds ago, so I guess you wrote it as you were fainting. "DJ Shmumu's pretty good, but he deserves to die. Hold on, I think I'm fainting."
amir: Mickey, my friend!
jake: Hang up.
amir: Yes, my friend. I too am excited and eager to be DJing your daughter's wedding tonight!
jake: Why does he trust you?
amir: Yes, I already spoke to her regarding the playlist; it is set in stone. I assure you she is a lovely bride, and she's gonna get the reception she deserves. I'm actually... setting up the turntables as we speak, Mickey!
jake:  Why do you do this?
amir: Not to give too much away, Mickey, but I figure we start with the Hora, move on to some playful, yet tasteful, Golden Oldies, before transitioning beautifully and seamlessly to the father-daughter dance! I believe the one you requested...  let me pull it up right now... is, uh... that's right! It's called "I'm not actually DJing your daughter's wedding tonight, Mickey!"
jake: Here we go.
amir: She's gonna be an ugly bride, Mickey, and she's probably not gonna get married, Mickey!
jake: That has nothing to do with being a DJ.
amir: You know why, Mickey? Because my Yelp reviews suck, Mickey!
jake: How is that his fault?
amir: News flash, Mickey: I press play on Spotify... and I faint, Mickey! Yeah! I really faint, Mickey! In fact, Mickey... I'm fainting right now, Mickey... Mickey, help me out, Mickey. 
jake:  He fainted, Mickey.
amir: Mickey!
jake: Mickey, he's gone.
amir: Mickey.
jake: Hey Mickey, let's hope he dies, huh? For both our sakes, Mickey.
jake: Mickey.

INTRO
jake: Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir!
amir: We should start charging for this shit!
jake: Bad idea.
amir: I know.
pat: No no, it's fun. It's just... New York is so dense and lively, you know? And-- and, and LA is more spread out and chill.
jake: That's a really good point.
paul: Yeah.
mike: Yeah, it's definitely an adjustment.
amir: Move. Move. Move.
mike: What? "Move"? Amir--
amir:  I'm sitting, I'm sitting, I'm sitting, I'm sitting, I'm sitting, I'm sitting! I'm sitting.
mike: Right-- oh. Okay. Okay, okay, okay, okay.
jake: So mean!
amir: Thank you. Fatass.
jake: Welcome to town, man. It's good to have you here...
mike: Alright. See you.
amir: Hey, I wish I knew y'all were eating today. I would have packed a lunch, or bought one.
jake: You didn't know we were eating today? By the way, looks like you did pack a lunch. Just a... giant bag of carrots, but still.
amir: What's the point of conversation as it stands right now? I can wax poetic about a myriad of hot topics. 
paul: New York versus LA.
amir: Okay... and what's the consensus? Just so I can play devil's advocate.
pat: No consensus, really. We;re just saying they're different.
amir: And in terms of theses differences, are we excited or thrown by them?
jake: You don't need all of the information. Okay? Just see if you can enter a conversation seamlessly.
amir:  Easy!
pat: ...Right. So... you know, New York just has a way of getting under your skin--
amir:  Been thinking about setting up a home theater system shit in my den!
jake: Jesus.
amir: What do you guys think is the difference between Sonos and other leading brands like Bose? Or do y'all only like to talk about unimportant shit?
jake: You know, I think your sound system is unimportant shit.
amir:  Really! Because last time I checked, audio was the second-most important part of the audio-video experience.
jake: Worst hands ever; stop doing that-- so it's the least important part, right?
amir: I just wish we'd talk about my hobbies too, but I feel like I can't even get a word in edgewise.
jake: You're dominating the conversation! What hobbies do you even have?
amir: Not really a hobby, but I'm pretty good at alienating significant others. Like if one of y'all's girlfriends or wives were here, I'd make her feel uninvited, unwelcome... I'd phase her out of the conversation, slowly but surely.  Box her out physically, just so she doesn't feel like one of us.
jake: Why would you think that's even close to a hobby? It's the opposite of a hobby. A hobby's an enriching way to spend your spare time, and that's just... that's tearing at the fabric of a loving relationship.
amir: At least we're talking about something!
jake: We were talking about something.
paul:  I'm gonna...
jake: Yeah, of course.
amir: Can't handle the heat, huh? F-f-f-f-fatass?  ...I think I might be dying.
jake: Yeah. Chew better. Just chew it all the way 'til it's mush, and then swallow. You don't swallow early.
amir: You don't have to tell me twice.
jake: Don't bring an entire bag of carrots to lunch. You bring one or two. I mean, you sat down 'cause you wanted to have a conversation, right?
amir: I still do. Even if it's just us three: me, you, and this thin little fatass.
jake: Pat... Patrick.
amir:  And then there were Jew. What should us two little sister-friends gab about? 
jake: What do you want to gab about?
amir: Can't hear you! Listening to a Spotify playlist aptly named "Songs That Pair Well with a Carrot-Based Lunch".
amir: Are you still in the room, fatass?
amir: ...Fatass?

jake: Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir!
amir: I actually have a good idea for a video.
jake: Don't.
amir: Very well, then.
amir: Best part of life?
jake: ...spending time with friends and family--
amir: Games! Jinx! 
amir: The next Tiny Wings is on this list. The next Snood is on this list.
jake: Right, I see that. "Tiny Wings 2". "Snood 2". You don't have the rights to either of those games.
amir: Copyright infringement.
jake: ...Exactly.
amir:  Doo-doot doo doot-doot doo! Doo! Jojo the Italian Plumberman.
amir: Let me see your phone.
amir: Okay.
jake: Why.
amir: What would you say if I told you I had a game that would fix this?
jake: Do you?
amir: Not yet.
amir: Ninety-five percent of gaming happens when you're on the shitter. So this game is called "Wipe Me", and you get to clean your butt virtually.
jake: ...As well as in real life, right?
amir: Like, nobody thought to land on the Moon, and then one night, we were just there!
jake: That's not how it worked. You thought we went to the Moon by accident?
amir: I'm just saying let's do that, but with this fix-your-phone game!
jake: Call tech support. Alright? Get my phone fixed.
amir: Shut up about your phone for a second. I'm... I'm having an idea.
jake: I can hear you peeing.
amir: You know how it's illegal to spy on people while they shit, shower, and shave?
jake: Yes.
amir:  Really?
jake: Let me see your phone.
amir: No chance in hell. That's an invasion of my privacy.
jake: You're invading other people's privacy.
amir: No I won't. Again. Or for the first time. I won't, and I didn't. And I haven't. Again. Or ever.
jake: That's a long piss.
amir: I'm peeing. For a second.
amir: Oh! Not really a game idea, but--
jake: Then I'm gonna stop you right there. It shouldn't be on this list.
amir: --I shave a soul patch.
jake: You're so scatterbrained. What do you do? You just sit around your apartment coming up with game ideas, when you have an idea for facial hair? You don't have to write down every dumb idea that comes into your mind!
amir: And the truth finally starts pouring out!
jake: I've said that. I've always said that.
amir:  Hmm-mmm, hmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm, yeah...
amir: Okay, so it's Spotify, but only for songs.
jake: Spotify is for songs. Also, that wasn't a game.
amir: Really? Because last time I checked, you play music.
jake: Fine. Just my first critique then. Spotify's already for songs.
amir: I'll put it in the "maybe" pile, then.
amir:  Hmm-mmm, alright, hmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm, do it too...
amir: Let me tell ya, I had a lot of time to come up with game ideas as a teen. I had facial backne.
jake: You mean regular acne?
amir: Nope, fbackne. I'm talkin' about back zits on my face. I wish I would've had acne. Acne would have been an improvement... acne would have been nice.
amir:  Two hearts beating as one, hmm-mmm...
jake: Say an idea, or I'm gonna leave.
amir: Parcheesi.
amir:  Yeah yeah, he just, uh, he just whacked it with a hammer, and it broke.  I know! I guess he-- I guess he thought he can fix it with an app, which I don't think you can do. Could you? If you w-- even if you dreamed big? 'Cause of the Moon landings. Okay. Yeah yeah.  You're a moron.
amir: "Oops! All Long Pieces Tetris".
jake: That actually sounds pretty satisfying.
amir: Well I don't have the ability or the rights to program it! Okay? So I'm kinda stuck there, aren't I. Don't say "nice", if you know for a fact I'm dead to rights.
jake: Why are you pitching me anything?
amir: I like lists.  In fact, can I pitch you a list of list ideas that I have?
amir:  No, no no, he'd be honored to be on your "Idiots of Tech Support" blog. The name is Jacob Hurwitz, and as for the picture, I have a primo one of him taking a shit. Or a shower. Perhaps a shave.  Hm?

jake: Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir.
amir: Bless you!
jake: I didn't sneeze.
amir: I know!
jake: No. No, please--
amir: "Top Ten Vacation Ideas for the Summer", by Amir Judy Blume-enfeld.
jake: Tell you what--  does anybody want a computer? Does anyone want a desktop? Amir doesn't use his.
amir: "Number ten--"
jake: To work.
amir: "Are you feeling zen? If not, a staycation is what I recommend. Or better yet, don't be a jerk. Unwind by being a man... and goin' to work."
jake: So your first vacation idea is not taking one. And working. Which you're not doing right now because you're sitting here, reading me this list.
amir: "Number nine: Stop whining about the time. Go to work. Can you?"
jake: Can you?
amir: "Please?"
jake: These aren't even vacation ideas!
amir: It's just the first two!
jake: Still! They're in the top ten! They're on the list, that you called "Vacation Ideas"!
amir: "Number eight: You're overweight! 'Cuz you overate. Whip your butt into shape with exercise classes. That's right: a boot camp retreat, for all y'all fatasses!"
jake: What is relaxing about a boot camp? How is that a vacation?
amir: "Number seven: A Sawa named Devon! This tween idol deserves that title. Shack up with 'Now and Then' co-star Devon Sawa in his Hollywood Hills bungalow! Now that sounds like a place that's... fun to go!"
jake: ...Isn't Devon Sawa dead?
amir: You're thinking of Brad Renfro.
jake: ...Fine.
amir: "Number six: Check out Brad Renfro's dicks!"
amir: "It's been too long since you've gone to see him. Won't you visit his mausoleum?"
jake: That's impolite. Wouldn't you say that's in poor taste? Can't he rest in peace?
amir: "Number five: an Owen named Clive! He's got a palace in the English hills, and you can visit and stay for the thrills! Clive Owen would love to have ya."
jake: No he wouldn't! So far, three of your ideas have been about visiting celebrities who definitely don't want you there. One of whom is dead.
amir: "Number four: Lock your door! This staycation is for you and a PlayStation 2. Lock yourself in your room all summer and close the blinds. That's the best way I know how to unwinds! And if it's a weekday... go to work!"
jake: You know, that's almost as sad as the Brad Renfro one. How are these vacation ideas? Barely any of them have involved a destination! Most of them have involved not traveling!
amir: "Number three: How 'bout some tea? It's a good liquid that's nice for your soul. Have it in a cup, a mug, or a... bowl..." What?
jake: You crossed lists? With another scroll?
amir: Shit. Yeah, I think I musta got...  I-- I need to get my shit together! 
jake: You need to stop writing all these scrolls.
amir: "Number two: This jelly won't do... we need a jam or a paste of some sort; 'almond butter is nice' is my... usual retort..." I'm sorry.
jake: What other scroll could this possibly even be from?
amir: I'm fucking unraveling here! Wheels are coming off as I stumble across the finish line!
jake: Just to be clear: don't think you had a good scroll up until this point.
amir: Yeah, I had a perfect game going!
jake: Absolutely not.
amir: Oh! Okay, here we go. "Number one: Palm Springs. A desert getaway with your best friend."
jake: Not going with you.
amir: "Well I know it might be a long snot..."
jake: Oh! I'm gonna throw up!
amir: "...but I figure it's worth a shot!"
jake: I can't believe you just snot rocketed on me. I can't believe how much came out.
amir: "The tickets are booked. The price is right; I looked. So what sayeth thee, my FFB? Will you go away with me?"
jake: You know what, dude? Fuck it. Snot rocket for you. Here we go--
jake: Aah! Idiot!
jake: Aah! Ass!
amir: Do it harder, like one--

jake: Bye.
amir: Wait!
amir: It's fun to watch TV at work! Thanks for including me, guys!
jake: We specifically tried not to include you. The email went out to a special Listserv we created, called "allbutamir@collegehumor.com".
amir: Can I change the channel? Can I change the channel, or do we have to watch this soccer shit?
amir:  Hi, twat. Yeah, can we get two large pizzas, one medium pie, and, let's say, seven small 'zas?
paul: Those are all just different words for the same thing.
rachel: And we already have pizza.
amir: And chicken wings? Yeah, I love those frickin' things.
jake: Can you not order in weird rhymes? It's rude.
amir: Whats?
jake: ..."Whats"?
amir: Ever notice how we call it "soccer", but in the rest of the world it's all like "Futbol! Futbol! Futbol!"
jake: Of course we noticed that.
amir: Then laugh! It's an observational humor!
jake: It's not humor. It's just an observation.
amir: Still! A chuckle would have been decent. Got this fatass to grin about it! 
paul: Oh, no. My cousin just sent me a text that made me smile. It wasn't you.
amir:  Count it!
amir:  My credit card number is, um, uh...  it's sixty-nine.
jake: Give me the phone.
amir: Alright. 
jake:  Four two two...
amir: Aww.
amir: Ahhh, this sport is boring. Nothing ever happens. It's just like, pass the ball. Kick the ball. I don't--
all: Goal! / Yes! Oh, man!
amir: And the universe gives me a slice of humble pie! My point still stands, though: Hardly anything ever--
all: Another goal! / Another one, oh my God! / Whoa!
amir: In what fucking world do you live in?
pat: Are... are you serious?
amir: Yeah, I'm serious. This is my food, shitbird.
pat: You ate all our pizza.
amir: I'm not talking to you.
jake: You are talking to him. By the way, I paid for this food. Okay? Remember, your card number was sixty-nine.
amir: As a joke! 'Cause sixty-nine means to 
jake: No, it does not!
amir: Everybody in this sport has a weird name. Who's that guy? Garageio?
paul: That's Fred.
amir: Weird.
pat: Your name's Amir!
amir: Take that back!
paul: Hey, man. Maybe you could apologize to Rachel. 'Cause--
amir: Why? I didn't do anything bad. All I said was that sixty-nining was, like, a 
jake: --Stop it!
rachel:  Make him stop!
amir: Why is it when people take up soccer it's considered cute and quirky, but when I get a hobby, no one says jack shit?
jake: Your hobbies aren't important. They don't affect anyone or anything.
pat: No-- what are your hobbies?
amir: Well, not really a hobby, but when my family and I dine at restaurants that give you beepers while you wait for a table, I'll always pretend like it's buzzing. Make my dumbass mom or my goofy dad walk up to the waitress, time after time, in vain.  Then at the end of the bit, I'll throw the beeper away so that my dad ends up owing cash for it.
jake: Your hobbies are bad.
amir: No shit, dude.
jake: You're bad.
amir: All I'm saying is that real athletes don't wear cleats. They wear real shit, like baseball shoes.
jake: Baseball players wear cleats.
amir: ...I'm starting to think my only friend in the room  is Fatass over here.  What do you think, dummy?  "Who are you calling a dummy, dummy?"
jake: God, this is sad.
amir:  Fatass loves it.
jake: Raise your hand if you like Amir.
amir: All's I'm saying is for a sport to be exciting, there should be points, you know? None of this low-scoring, tie-game bullshit--
all: Goal! / Oh, awesome! / Oh yeah! / Woo!
amir: Why does this keep happening to me?
rachel: I think soccer players are the hottest.
amir: Gay much?
jake: What?
amir: Sorry, I thought Pat said that.
amir: Why is it, on airplanes, they give you little tiny napkins with your drink? What are they, afraid I'm gonna spill?
paul: ...Yes.
amir: Whatever. My point still stands.
jake: No it doesn't.
amir: Yes it does! I'm just saying I don't spill shit.
amir: Oh, sh--
amir: Sorry, am I being a dumbass American for preferring baseball to this "game"? I mean, baseball might be twice as slow and pretty boring, but at least shit happens--
all: Goal! / Awesome!
amir: Fuck, dude! This is more than a coincidence! This is so bizarre! I'm, like, freaking out! Every time I bring up the low-scoring nature of the game, which it--
all: Goal! / Oh my God! / What!
amir: How?
jake: Oh, man.
amir: That was fun, actually! When's the next match?
jake: It's over, man. That was the final.

amir: Hey, you're watching Jake and a celeb.
jake: Egotistical.
amir: Realistical!
amir: Yeah.
jake: I stopped.
amir: Oh! I came up with a pretty neat little plan today... dating a celebrity?
jake: How's that a plan? That's a question.
amir: Life's not about what you know, it's about who you know. And in Los Angeles, it's about who ya fuck.  I'm serious. If I'm gonna make it in this kooky town, I have to be seen canoodling with Jamie Lee Curtis on the Sunset Strip yesterday.
jake: What makes you think it's so easy to date a celebrity? What makes you even think you deserve to be canoodling with anybody, let alone somebody as beautiful and strong as Jamie Lee Curtis?
amir: You naive little twat.
jake: Don't say that word in the office.
amir: Nothing's real in Hollyweird, okay? A lot of it is just make-believe fairy dust. Some of it is actually just a PR nightmare bullshit!
jake: You're a PR nightmare bullshit.
amir: Fuck off.
jake: You fuck off, dude! You think any publicist out there is gonna let their client date a thirty-one-year-old guy who shits in his pants?
amir: I changed the khakis! Fuck off!
jake: Recently! Recently you changed them!
amir: Yeah!
jake: Well you shit in them over a year ago! So you fuck off!
amir: Uh-oh! Daddy got Amanda Bynes's Gmail address. Yeah, her niece went to my cousin Leron's laser tag place in Queens. Leron stole the cell phone, texted Amanda, and she gave him the email address so he would give the cell phone back! I was gonna take you on a double date. Me, you, Amanda, and Amanda's best friend, who's probably a Meg Ryan type, but I can always ask somebody else.
jake: Jesus, dude...  Why didn't you tell me you had an in with Bynes?  Ha ha haaa! She's all that!
amir: She's a loose cannon, sure, but sometimes the crazy ones are the ones that land you on the back jacket of Star Magazine!
jake: You're goddamn right, Blumenfeld! Gimme that email address! Let me email her.
amir: No!
jake: For you! ...Let me email her for you. What kind of monster do you think I am? I'm just trying to help you out...
jake:  ...idiot... I swear to God, I swear to God...
jake: "Dear Ms. Bynes..."
amir: Nice!
jake: "Today is the first day of the rest of your wife!"
amir: Is that too forward?
jake: Girls love that lovey-dovey shit, dude.  "I have admired you from afar--" scratch that-- "I have Aladdined you from Jafar..."
amir: Is that good to write?
jake: Girls love Disney. That Disney shit. Stop second-- really, stop second-guessing me. Alright? "I would love to take you out to a meal of sushi, my treat, if you will treat meat to a seat... on your face!"  "Love... Jake."
amir: No!
jake: Yes. Fuck off, dude! That's the "fuck off" email!
amir:  No!
jake: Oh... you're crying, dude? Hey, you can still be the best man at the wedding.
amir: Promise?
jake:  ...No, that's really the kind of thing I should run by my fiancee! Bynes has to weigh in on that! You understand. It's a partnership! Not a dictatorship! She might want to have one of her A-list celebrity friends give her away! Ryan Reynolds, Ryan Gosling, Ryan Phillippe, some Ryan! I promise you, it's Ryan. Fuck... fuck, man, it might be Seacrest. Ryan Seacrest at my fucking wedding? It's a star-studded-- my, my wedding's gonna look like the fuckin' Oscars.  I'm just like... holy shit!
amir: Even if one of the brothers Ryan give her away doesn't mean I can't be your best man.
jake:  Honestly, dude, I don't mean for this to be all passive-aggressive, but... all's bare...
amir: Oh!
jake: ...in shove...
amir: Oh!
jake: ...and floor.
amir: I'm nude! You've nuded me!
jake:  Ohhh! Incoming email from amandabynes@gmail.not... a bounce-back? From Mailer-Daemon? ...That means she's with Matt Damon! Just my luck! You said she had a friend though? Meg Ryan? What's Gucci with her?

amir: About how, like, if you were born in January, that means you're a Capricorn, and so you're some type of way?
jake: So not horoscope things, just horoscopes in general.

jake: Down to the minute.
amir:  "You will confront conflicts this month, but rest assured you can solve them. Maybe not, though." ...It's vintage you!
jake: That's vintage anybody.
amir:  No! Because the way it works is that you're a Leo, so the stars look like a lion, and it knows what you're gonna-- how you're gonna act.
jake: Try not to learn new things.  The stars look like a lion, and it knows how I'm gonna act?
amir: Yeah. They really do. They look like a lion.
jake: Put your hand down, 'cause you're not teaching me anything, okay? It's like you read the Wikipedia for horoscopes-- I don't even think you got into astrology...
jake: No? I didn't-- didn't think so.
amir: No way.
jake: And then you just regurgitate everything like it's your new worldview! Your mind is so impressionable.
amir: My mind is not impressionable!
jake: Yes it is!
amir: I guess it is.
jake: God, that's fast. Even for you, that was fast. You're, like, hypnotized. Like, you'll believe anything anyone says.
amir:  I will believe anything anyone says...
jake:  You're getting sleepy.
amir: I'm getting...  sleepy...
jake: You're getting very sleepy.
amir: Very sleepy, Master.
jake: Didn't say I was your master.
amir: Didn't have to.
jake: Anything I say is your command. Your mind is open to my suggestion.
amir: I am your mental slave.
jake: ...Yes.
amir: And thus, you are my master.
jake: Fine. Just don't repeat it, okay?
amir: Fine, Master.
jake: ...When I snap my fingers, you will wake up.
amir: Yes, Master.
jake: And when you wake up, you will...
amir: Cluck like a chicken. Something silly. Boy, will my face be red.
jake: You'll throw yourself out the window.
amir: Jesus.
jake: That's right. When I snap my fingers, you will awaken and run out the window.
amir: My fear is that the window will be closed and I'll break my neck on the glass. Then you'll be left to deal with me as a quadriplegic, Master.
jake: Fine. Open the window...
amir: Mm-hmm.
jake: ...then jump.
amir: No chicken.
jake: No chicken. Just jumping. Leaping, out of a four-story window, to your death.
amir: ...Got it.
jake: Before you go...
amir: Mm-hmm.
jake: ...remember to shoot me a text. Something like... "Hey, there was nothing you could have done to stop me", et cetera.
amir: Mm. A suicide note of sorts. Yup.
jake: A suicide text of sorts. Indeed. So when I snap my fingers--
amir: Absolving you of guilt.
jake: Exactly.
amir: Got it.
jake: Got it. Okay, so I'm gonna snap my fingers. Wake up, suicide text...
amir: Chicken.
jake: Out the window. No chicken.
amir: No chicken.
jake: No clucking-- you can do whatever you want on the way down.
amir: Sure.
jake: Just be sure to do the... you know, the important bullet points.
amir: Absolutely. Thank you, Master.
amir:  Aaah. Jesus.  What happened?
jake: I don't know, man. Just... whatever. Just chilling.
amir:  ...I'm texting you....
jake: Oh, yeah. Go for it.
amir: ...Hmm.
jake:  Semicolon, dollar sign, "Jake tried to kill me", sunglasses emoji, "I'm not a chicken".
amir:  That's right! My horoscope told me to be on the lookout for hypno-killers, and it was right! Sagittarius, motherfucker!
jake: You're a Capricorn.
amir:  You still tried to kill me! Little fucker!

intro:
jake: Heeeey!
amir: You're watching Jake and Amir.
jake: Oh! Your breath smells awful!
amir: Chill!
amir: Gum?
jake: I'm OK.
amir: I'm gonna...have a slice ...thought I'd offer you one.
jake: I'm good.
amir: First you're OK now you're good?  What's wrong with you? You're acting all goofy-- I mean are you high at work? I'm not gonna tell anyone, I'm just down to toke! Or at least have a bite of whatever edible you're high!
jake: I just don't want--
amir: My gum.
jake:--to talk to you.
amir: I know. 
jake:  I know?
amir: I come in peace. 
amir:  Hmm?
jake: I didn't say anything. Do you wish I did?
amir: Are you sure? It's on the house!
jake: Did you think I was declining because I thought you were gonna make me pay for it?
amir: The pack was like two bucks! If you wanna toss me a dollar...sure that'd be fine . That'd be fair--
jake: Fair? No it wouldn't. That would mean I get half the pack of gum, and I said no to a piece.
amir: You said you were OK!? You said you were good-- you didn't say jack shit about no. Holy shit; you are high!!
jake: Relax! Alright? I'll have a piece of gum.
amir:  Slice.
jake: Piece! Never correct me--Just give me the gum!
amir:  Oh. Well. What are you gonna do for me? 
jake: Never mind.
amir: Wait! I have something that you want ! You gotta pay me back somehow, that's how society works!  I'm not working here for free! 
jake: You're not working here at all!  I don't think I've ever seen you do or complete a single task--chew the gum with your mouth closed. Alright?  You look so unnatural doing it.
amir:  It's cool. It's friendly. It's chill--
jake: Don't bob your head--it's not friendly. What's friendly about it?
amir: It's like ...It's just a nice thing to do! 
jake: I don't want the gum. I was just gonna take it so you would shut up!
amir: Shut up!  Really!?  That language?!  From someone who has something that you want. It's tit for tat, Jakey! When that tit-tat is a Tic Tac or a Kit-Kat, you can't go this that, hit hat! You gotta go mit ma--
jake: Focus!
jake: I don't wanna sit next to you anymore.
amir:  What?
jake: I wanna move desks.
amir: Jake--
jake: I'm done.
amir: Gum's gone, man...alright? This is...
jake:  Doesn't matter that the gum's gone. I'm--
amir:  It's such a--This is such a small thing in the grand scheme of things. I-i-it's infinitesimal!
jake: It's small, maybe, in the grand scheme of things but the grand scheme of things is what I'm worried about, OK? It's a lot of little things, like this, adding up. Also...you know, you stabbed me once--
amir: Once.
jake: More often than I've stabbed anyone!
amir: Really?...Shit. I'm sorry!
jake: That's also the first time you apologized for it which is pretty fucked.
amir: Just  look under your desk.
jake: It's my own pack of gum. 
jake: It's a pretty nice gesture. I see where you were going this whole time--
amir: Now in terms of paying me back are you thinking about cash or favours?
jake: I thought this was a gift.
amir: Well I still wanna hang out!!

amir: Hey, you're watching a very special birthday episode of Jake and Amir!
jake: Please stop it.
jake: Stop, bud.
amir: Go! Go! Go! Go shorty! It's your birfday! We gonna party like it0 your birfday!
jake: Thank you. Thank you very much.
amir:  ...What?
jake: I said "thank you".
amir:  You said it so soft! It was a big deal.
amir: I made a big deal of your birthday, and you're just like "Thank you. Thank you."
jake: And I appreciate that, and I would actually like that... well, I'm trying to subdue you a little bit.
amir: I'm-- I'm hyped!
jake: I know, and I don't want you to be.
amir: I'm hyphy!
jake: I know.
amir: Want to know the difference between me and 50 Cents?
jake: You're not a gangster, you were never shot, you're not wealthy, talented, or successful, you're not a good businessman, you're not friends with Eminem...
amir: I do give a fuck if that's your birfday... I really do.
jake: I know.
amir: Silly me, I guess. You know, the big two-nine, it's kind of a big deal. In fact, how would you like a two-nine fish sandwich?
jake: I don't think I would like a two-nine fish sandwich.
amir:  Of course... why would you? Let me do you one better. You know how you have a weird love affair with coupons?
jake: I know how you make up realities to justify the weird stupid things you do...
amir:  Here's a book of three hundred and sixty-five coupons. One for every day until you reach the wipe old age...  of dirty!
jake: I bet there is actual shit on that.
jake: Yeah. Wow.  "Free hug from Amir."
jake: "Free massage from Amir."
amir:  They get better.
jake: "Free impression from Amir. White celebrity only."
jake: "Free impression from Amir. Any ethnicity goes. Hey, this is your birthday, after all."
jake: Racist.
amir: They get better.
jake: They get violent. "Free punch from Amir to anybody of your choosing. Females allowed/encouraged. No questions asked."
amir:  They get better.
jake: "Freestyle rap, fifty dollars off"? Fifty dollars off of what?
amir: A hundred and fifty dollars. The going rate.
jake: So it's not free.
amir: Free of style! ...Free of style! I'm starting to think you don't like the coupon book!
jake: I don't love the coupon book. Why don't you just take it back?
amir: I can't take it back! It's non-transferrable! Non-returnable! Read the fine print! I couldn't take--
amir: Oh!
jake: Sorry, bud! That's what you get for trying to give me a bum gift!
amir:  No, no, like it really cut me! Ya cut me bad!
jake: How are you this fragile?
amir: Fragile? Ya-y-y-y-ya sliced me! Ya really diced me, dude! And on my favorite day of the year: your birfday!
jake: Even if I just sliced you, you're bleeding way too much!
murph:  Jake. I saw what you did to Amir there.
jake: Look, Murphy. Get out of here, okay, dude? It's not that big of a deal.
murph: It's actually a huge deal.
jake: You want to talk about injuring people at work? Amir's done so much worse. Hell, man, you've done a lot worse!
amir: I'm leaking, Murphy!
jake: Tattletale!
murph: And I've caught you...  bitch-handed! Yeah!
jake: Ouch! Dude, let go, alright? It's my friggin' birfday!
murph: I don't give a fuck if it's your birfday! It's your Murphday now.
jake: I don't want it to be my Murphday.
murph: Too bad. It's your Murphday.
jake: I hate my Murphday.
murph: It's your Murphday. You shouldn't hate it. Eat your Murphday cake.
jake: I don't like that one bit. Amir, I want to use the coupon!
amir:  Murph! Murph! It's your turf! Come down to Erf! You crazy Smurf!
jake:  That's the rapping one! The punching one!
amir: No, that was females only!
jake: Females allowed! Females encouraged! Aaaah!

amir: Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir, and I'm gonna be rich!
jake: Why?
amir: Money, honey!
jake: Nice.
amir: Okay...
amir: Good news! Gonna finally heed your advice.
jake: Washing your hands after you shit? Not stealing from sleeping homeless women? Holding yourself accountable, morally and professionally, for a--
amir:  I'm going to apply for a credit card.
jake: I never said that. I never said that-- do the washing your hands one.
amir: One step at a time.
jake: Backwards computer.
amir: Oh, backw--...
jake: Come on.
amir: First thing's first: I'm the realest. 
jake: First thing's first is your social security number.
amir: Don't have one.
jake: I know you don't have one.
amir:  'Cause I'm so fancy!  Also I'm an illegal alien.
jake:  You're an illegal alien.
amir: Yeah.
jake: I already know.
amir: Can't wait to rack up these points!
jake: What do you need points for?
amir: Miles.
jake: For what?
amir: Trips.
jake: To go where?
amir: ...Points.
jake: Cool.
amir: Miles.
amir: ...Miles? ...Miles!
jake: My name's Jake.
jake:  "What's the largest purchase you've ever made?"
amir: Oh, actually, I spent a hundred and ten thousand Euro on a koi fish once.
jake: A koi fish?
amir: Well technically a dolphin, but it was a coy little fish.  Little bugger was playing hard to get. We actually met each other-- have you ever been to the Maldives, or Mall-dives, or whatever?
jake: You know what? I don't want to know anything else, about you, or the dolphins. Stop talking!
amir: My credit score is so low, someone once stole my identity, felt bad, and gave it back.
jake: Is that a tweet?
amir: It's a truth! ...Ruth!
amir: I'm actually down to open a joint checking account with you. You know I do have tens of millions of dollars.
jake: Okay.
amir: But, here's the trick: you do have to tell people about it.
jake: How many people?
amir: ...Seventy.
jake: No deal.
amir: Aah, no no no, nineteen.
jake: Alright, now I feel bad.
amir: Aah-- two!
jake: I feel bad.
amir: I'm serious, dude. My credit score is so low, I couldn't get approved for a birthday card. 
jake: Stop roasting yourself.
amir: Phyllis Diller is here...
amir: So what you're saying is once I have this magic card, I can buy whatever I want, like a vehicle, or a three-bean salad, or a Mr. Skin Pro account?
jake: It's not a magic card. Yeah, you can buy whatever you want, as long as--
amir: I know, but I can get, like, a salami sandwich, some Silly Putty, and, let's say, I don't know, a Mr. Skin Pro account?
jake: Right. As long as you pay the m--
amir: Can I get a Mr. Skin Pro account with--
jake: You already have one. Look at this. You've had it for two years, and you owe a lot of money.
amir: My credit score is so low, Flo Rida wrote a song about it.
jake: "Low"?
amir: "Whistle"! 
jake: Your breath is so bad.
amir: What I'm in dire need of is actually dolphin food. Or dolphin medicine. Or...
jake: ...Dolphin--
amir: Caskets, yeah. Exactly right.
jake: Not what I was gonna say.
amir: Because you can stuff it into a human casket?
jake: Of course not.
amir: No, you can't.
amir: Call me Han! Because my credit score is...
jake: So low.
amir: ...out of this world!
jake: Bad.
jake: Really bad.
amir: You know, human caskets, not too terrible of an idea.
jake: Didn't say it.
amir: If you just wiggle that dorsal fin back and forth like you're peeling off a soda tab, you know,  A, B, C... and then whatever letter it lands on, that girl has a crush on you?
jake: What do you mean, "lands on"?
amir:  Like if it gets ripped off on S, you're gonna marry a Samantha...!
jake: You're a monster.
amir: Now I understand to build my credit score, I need to make my payments in a timely fashion.
jake: Right, so--
amir: Okay, and if I don't will they hack my nuts off?
amir: Then I'm good.
jake: They're not gonna hack your nuts off--
amir: Then I'm good.
jake: --but you'll go into debt and they'll take away your possessions--
amir: But my nuts? Are they gonna take away my most prized possession? My family jewels? ...I'm okay then.
amir: Mirror, mirror, on the wa--  "Denied". How is that normal?
jake: It's very normal. It's very normal because under "Debt" you wrote "150K dolphin fee", under "Address" you wrote "Fuck off NSA", and under "Annual Income"-- I don't even know how you did this, 'cause it's a drop-down menu-- but you wrote "Flappy the dolphin is my guarantor; give me the gold card".
amir:  I wanted the points! I wanted the points, I needed the miles, and I could have really used a trip.  Least I got my nuts.
amir: ...Dude!

amir: Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir, and I do declare!
jake: What?
amir: I don't know!
amir:  Unhealthy...  ...What?
jake: I didn't say anything. You said "unhealthy"--
amir: Unhealthy much!
jake: You said "unhealthy", then I didn't say anything. If you're trying to start a conversation--
amir:  Look at you--
jake: Why do you do that?
amir:  Bad for your back, bad for your spine, bad for your life, bad for your attitude, bad--
jake: You're eating nachos!
jake: You're eating nachos right now, and you're drinking a chocolate milkshake.
amir:  Yeah, that's 'cause I have a standing desk! Which means I can afford it...  ...fuckwad! 
jake: You're a fuckwad.  You think standing at your desk burns-- what, that's like fifteen hundred calories! Alright? And-- ...also, you're sitting.
amir:  Yeah, but on an exercise ball! Okay? AKA!
amir: ...What?
jake: ...AKA what?
amir: What are you, waiting for me to talk?  Alright! Let's talk!
jake: Waiting for you to finish! AKA means "also known as".
amir: Okay, I didn't know that... wow!
jake: It's not just a pe-- it's not the end of the sentence!
amir: I didn't know that! I thought it was like a pu-- yeah, like a...
jake: A pun?
amir: It's a play on words!
jake: We don't have to talk! We don't have to talk at the office. That's not leading a healthy lifestyle. You can't afford to eat that food.
amir: My legs were tired, fatass! And by the way, this is healthy! Healthier than the standing desk, 'cause I can do crunches while I work! 
jake: Your eyes are shut. So you're not doing anything while you work. You're just doing crunches, and... what terrible form! You're twirling your ass on top of the ball like you're wiping with it.
amir: Yeah, well they hurt my back pain!
jake: Redundant.
amir: Yeah! I have sciatica, motherfucker!
jake: I think sciatica is pain in your leg.
amir: Yes! Which is why I can't stand. So I sit, which hurts my back. That's why I got the desk! It just hurts, so I'm sitting, AKA!
jake: ...If you're this sick, if you're this unhealthy, why don't you just do the decent thing, and allow yourself to die?
amir: ...Jesus!
jake: That was real.
amir: That's, like, a lot of times you ask me to die.
jake: I know, and I mean it every time.
amir:  It's so... sad.
jake: Trust me, I know.
amir: It's sad to me that you want me dead.
jake: I feel bad as a person that I want so badly for you to be dead and gone, but I--
amir: Yeah. You're not even hiding it anymore.
jake: No, I think I'm just gonna be open with it.
amir: I need to... I need to lay down.
jake: Thirty seconds ago, you were boasting about your standing desk, and now you're on the floor.
amir:  It doesn't matter if I'm sitting or lying, okay? As long as my work gets handed in.
jake: What work are you handing in? You're just shoveling nachos into your face, lying down on the ground, and-- oh my God, you're asleep.
jake: How is that possible? You were just yelling. Now you're asleep.
jake:  Thank you...
amir: I'm alive!
jake: Ass.
amir:  And it's all thanks to that standing desk.
amir: What?

jake: Why even come in?
amir: I can work from my phone.  ...Shit.
jake: Nice.
amir:  They're here, they're here! Help me choose a headshot!
jake: Don't act giddy like I'm gonna be excited about helping you choose a headshot.
amir: I just want your opinion!
jake: My opinion is you suck.
amir: About the headshots, idiot!  You should have let me finish! Now you look like a fool!
jake: Why do you need headshots? You have a job. You have a salary. Health insurance.
amir: I want to be a famous! Ass! A star is born? Nah... a star is corn!
jake: What a dumb headshot, buddy.
amir: Please don't call these dumb. Okay? I spent, like, a bad amount of money on these.
jake: Any amount of money you spent on those would be a bad amount of money, considering you're not an actor and you don't need them.
amir: I have an audition today!
amir: Wow! Suddenly, Jake's-- actually, this is perfect!  I'll give you a fork and a knife so you can eat your words. And, in addition to those--
jake:  God, these are nice.
amir: --I have a napkin... where the French is it? I don't want you to spill the words--
jake: Did you bring this cutlery to work just to make me do this?
amir: Where the fff-- is it, dude?
jake:  It doesn't matter where the napkin is, okay? What's the role?
amir: The role is of a paralegal, in the film "Steinberg and Ginsberg".
jake: Are you sure you don't mean firm Steinberg and Ginsberg? And the role is just an office job that you're not qualified for?
amir: Every interview in this town is an audition. In this town.
jake: Nice, dude. Give it to me.
jake: Yikes. Way too revealing. Right? I mean, at least you had the decency to blur your pubes.
amir:  No, they're just blurry.
jake: You grow blurry pubic hair?
amir: I think so, yeah. They're mosaic.
jake:  Sorry, did Terry Richardson take these?
amir: Actually, they were taken by a Brazilian photographer.  Nunya? Ever heard of him?
jake: Nunya Business?
amir: No, Nunya Luiz Ricardio. He's actually pretty famous in Rio.
jake: Do something else with your life.
amir: Been painting recently! Nothing too crazy, just some abstract pieces. Trying to open up my own gallery.
jake: That's crazy! Of course that's crazy. Trying to open up your own gallery when you have a job, and... you're not very good at painting!
amir: Subjective.
jake: You're so fast at being dumb. Why don't you just try to harness that power for good, instead of... stupidity?
amir:  Been baking recently!
jake: Quick. Burned.
amir: Yeah, nothing too crazy. Just, uh, applying for grants to open up my own patisserie/gallery.
jake: Bad business idea. Bad you. Just stop acting, stop painting, stop baking. It's a waste of time, money, and I think effort, though it seems like you don't try very hard at anything.
amir:  Found your napkin!
jake: That one's pretty good.
amir: Nothing too crazy, just some, uh... oregano.
jake: Origami.

amir:  I did it a few weeks ago!
jake: Did I invite you in here to brag, Blumenfeld? I don't like to share the limelight, so why don't you tread light. Fucker.
amir: You invited me in here 'cause you said nobody else would hold your bucket for you.
jake:  Shhhhhh. Just relax about why I invited you in here.  Look, been seein' this Cup of Water Challenge thing on Facebook, but... you know, I'mma do it J-Witz style, do you two better. First of all: I say fuck it, I'm gonna go a whole bucket. And, uh, another thing, Regis: I put a freakin' ice cube in here. And that is my final answer.
amir: Aren't most people doing it with a...with a bucket and--
jake:  And IIIIII-ee-III will always ice cube!  Makes it colder, makes me bolder.
amir: It-- it's called the Ice Bucket Challenge--
jake:  "It's c-- It's ca-- It's c--" You got a stuttering prboblem much, dude?
amir: "Prboblem"?
jake: Yeah, I said "prboblem". I s-- I misspoke. I misspoke, but you stuttered!
amir: No, I did not.
jake:  Any-- how! I'm gonna freeze myself with this here bucket, like, uh, Jack Nicholson at the end of the Shining. Hey, you think he ever met Steve Urkel? From Family Matters?  "Uhh, did I do that?" 
amir: ...Maybe, yeah. I--
jake: Alright. Fuck you.  Okay. I'm not gonna do this before challenging a couple of my close personal friends to, uh, take the Jake challenge, that is, not a cup, but the fuck-it bucket, and, uh, not just one, but a big-ass cube o' ice! 
amir: S-- ...so yes. Just one.
jake: Okay. Bradley Cooper, from Limitless. Tarvis Baker, from Blink-182 . And, and another guy: Vanilla Bean Ice himself! Stop-- Hammer time!  Dahh-nah-nah-nah... nah-nah, can't touch this.
amir: Alright. Here we go. Ready.
jake: Hey, hey, hold on, before you do it,  as I understand it, I was challenged to donate a hundred dollars to ALS research, unless I dump this, this bucket of water on my head, in which case... ALS research, y'all owe me a hundred bucks.

jake: Just-- ...I didn't invite you here to do an interview, did I? Let's do this! Come on!
jake/amir: Three, two one!

jake: Why is it expensive?
amir: Cash!
amir: Hey Jake, what do you call a Twitter account for cottage cheese?
jake: ...What?
amir: Cheese!
jake: Bad joke! Bad teeth!
amir: Hope you like to barbecue!
jake: Why?
amir: 'Cause homeboy's got a grill!
jake: Why did you do that to your face? What's wrong with you?
amir: I like flaunting that I make cash!
jake: How do you make cash?
amir:  Money--
jake: I didn't ask what cash was. I asked how you made it. You don't do anything.
amir: My dad gives me bank. Quite bank, actually.
jake: Okay, then you know what? You don't make anything. You get pathetic handouts from your old man, and it's not cool to flaunt that with exorbitantly expensive jewelry for your teeth.
amir: I got this grill off Sale!
jake: On sale, and still, it's probably pretty expensive.
amir: No, my cousin Leron. He has a friend named Sale.
jake: He's got a friend named Sale?
amir: Well, had a friend named Sal.
jake: ...Sale, or Sal?
amir: Sale. Sale.
jake: Which one?
amir: Sale!
jake: Sale, or Sal?
amir: Sam!
jake: Which one is it? Sale, Sal, or Sam?
amir: ...Sale.
jake: Doesn't matter. Okay, you got the grill off him?
amir: Off her. And no, not her grill, her teeth. Okay? When she passed, me and Leron had the dim idea  to gank the dentures off her still-breathing body!
jake: Still breathing. So she hadn't passed.
amir: We're all at the vet trying to huff some of that laughy gassy, when we realized: uh-oh! Some of it's euthanasia! So me and Leron hightail it the fuck out of there, but, uh... Sale wasn't too lucky. She couldn't flap her wings fast enough.
jake: Flap her wings?
amir: Did I mention Sale was a goose?
jake: ...No! No, of course not, 'cause then all my questions would have been about that! Why did the goose have teeth?
amir: I guess you can say she's trans-gandered!
jake: Decent pun, doesn't explain the teeth, and your gums are bleeding.
amir:  Sure, small price to pay.
jake: Kind of a lot of blood, and it's a pretty big price to pay, man! You don't have teeth. You and your cousin are friends with a goose.
amir: Were!
jake: Still! A goose!
amir: No, I mean me and Leron aren't cousins anymore! He frickin' divorced me!
jake: Please, just one insane thing at a time. Why did the goose have teeth?
AMIR; Dentures.
jake: Which you stole.
amir: How was your weekend? ...Always talkin' about my shit. How was your Friday? What'd you do Saturday morning?
jake: Where are your real teeth?
amir: I traded them to Leron for a BeDazzler so that I can jewel-encrust Sale's dentures so that I can flaunt my father's wealth! What don't you get?
jake: Why do you hate yourself?
amir: Excuse?
JAKE You're on this twisted quest to change your body, mind, and spirit. You're constantly adopting new hobbies.  You've had countless plastic surgeries-- stop dancing!  None of it is ever to any avail. At the end of the day, you're still you... and you suck.
jake: Oh, I know that did hurt.
jake: There it is.  Finally. That's what I was hoping for. That's the way you should always be.
amir: Want to know the gayest part?
jake: Don't use that word like that.
amir: I truly believe that the world revolves around me.  Not even metaphorically, either. Like, uh, say this marble is me, and this tennis ball is our solar system? 
jake: Quick to get those.
amir: Yeah, this is how I feel. Like I am at the center of it. Like I'm the Sun.  I mean, how dumb is that?
jake: It's the stupidest thing I've ever heard. Nothing revolves around you. You absolutely don't matter, 'cause you're a goose murderer. You're a teeth thief.
amir: Yeah? Well at least I got a grill I can count on!  Hope you like sausage!
jake: Raw meat. In your mouth.
jake: Holy shit, how is it sizzling?
amir: I'm the Sun! I told you I was one!

amir: Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir, and if y'all want to follow me on Instagram--
jake: Out of time.
amir: Damn it!
amir: How would you like to accompany me on an online shopping spree?
jake: Looks like you already went on an offline stealing spree. You clearly stole this from the Apple store.
amir: I paid for it with my privacy. You know Apple owns your shit, right?
amir: I think I'll order a V-neck and a plaid, 'cause I'm from Teaneck, and hi, I'm Brad! 
jake: Alright. Brad.
amir: Call me Brad!
jake: I am calling you Brad. If you're ordering clothes just 'cause it rhymes, that's a bad idea.
amir: Yeah, well airplanes were a bad idea too, but business is booming, so I'll take my chaunces.
jake: Airplanes were a good idea. And business isn't booming.
jake: You're never right. You're never right about--
amir: Oh, I should buy sunglasses.
jake: You already have sunglasses.
amir: No, I don't think so.
jake: I think you do. Remember, you're really fast at putting them on?
jake: God, that was quick. It was so fast.
amir: Oh!
jake: "Oh" is right, man. Your shopping cart is getting really expensive. You're not even comparing prices across other sites. I don't even think you're looking at the sizing chart with a discerning eye.  That's a medium, a medium, a small, an extra small, an extra large, a size eleven shoe, a size two shoe!
amir: Exqueef me. 
jake: ...Was that a fart, or--
amir: Queef.  Two distinct queefs.
jake: I got it.
amir: You know, I just wish I had an event to wear these to. I mean, I'm buying these platinum-white dress shoes, but I literally will never wear them.
jake: So don't buy them.
amir: Well, what if I get invited to a gala, ass?
jake: A gala? I've never seen anyone invite you to lunch!
jake: Ow--
amir:  You know, whenever I go online shopping, I like to reward myself with a little "you're worth it" gift.  And today I got myself this zebra-print pillow!  I'm obsessed!
jake: Who are you talking to?
jake: I can't believe you scratched me.
amir: I'm sorry.
jake: Like a cat.
amir: I was upset.
jake: I don't care.
amir: You offended me!
jake: So what?
amir: If it makes you feel any better, I might even get a plus one to the gala!
jake: You're not going to a gala!
jake: Hey-- no!
amir: Say that again, and I will scratch your other face!
amir: Hey, pretty neat little lifehack: if you put in a pseudonym in the shipping information, like Vance or something, the package will show up with that fake name on it.
jake: That's not a lifehack. That's the most boring idea in the world. You'll just have a package with the name Vance on it.
amir: Yeah, but then after a while, the mailman will start to call you Vance! He'll be like, "Hey Vance, how's it going?" You'll be like, "Oh, it's pretty good, but actually boom! Gotcha! My name's Brad!"
amir: These white shoes are breaking the bank, but I feel like I gotta have 'em. You know, just in case-- and don't say what you're about to, or I will scratch you yet again-- but I feel like I gotta have 'em just in case I get invited to a charity event, or worse still, a, a--
jake: A gala. Yeah, I know.
amir: A gala. Yeah, exactly right, a gala.
jake: Tell you what, buddy. Why don't you just leave them in your online basket, you don't have to check out right now--
amir: No way.
jake: --but if you get invited to a white tie event--
amir: No, dude! That's--
jake: --or a gala... I'm not saying-- look--
amir: It's way too risky!
jake: You can order them in time!
amir: Bought 'em.  I bought 'em!
jake: Smart. Smart, good.
amir: We're going to a gala.
jake: Yeah? We're not.
amir:  You think this button-down is pee-proof, or dry clean only?
jake: Pee-proof?
amir: Or dry clean only!
jake: What is pee-proof? You said that first.
amir: Yeah, pee-proof! Just in case I--
jake: Hey-- hey! Don't! Leave it! Oh!
amir: Wha-- oh! Oh, sh--
amir: Alright, I can't bear to look.  What's the damage?
jake: Great. You shut your eyes, and you didn't click "Order". You just deleted your whole cart.
amir: Huh. That was a cheap spree, to be sure.
jake: You pissed on my shirt a little bit, by the way.
amir: Well, you should have gone pee-proof! You know, just in ca--
jake: Oh-- hey!
amir: Oh my God, why again?

jake: Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir.
amir: Not me! My eyes are closed.
jake: Perfect. 
amir: Ow!
amir:  Check it out.
jake: Can you please just go back to your desk? I'm trying to work--
amir: Ohh!
jake: Oh!
amir: Oh, it's in me!
jake: Oh, God!
amir: Oh, shards!
jake: Shards?
amir: Shards where I shart!
jake: I'll get help.
amir:  No! No, it's funny!
jake: ...What?
amir: It's a funny goof!
jake: Dude, you are clearly in a lot of pain right now.
amir: It's gonna be worth it! When it starts copying my ass!
jake: You're not gonna have an ass when this is all done! You just sliced it, buddy! You sliced it wide open!
jake: Oh!
amir: It's burning my anus!
jake: Then get off it!
amir: No!
jake: Hey!
amir: You'll ruin the joke!
jake: Amir, your ass is burned.
amir: Yeah, it's burned. It's burned bad.
jake: It's cut!
amir: Absolutely! Sliced from taint to sphincter! Gutted like a fish!
jake: So climb up on out of that copier, huh? Pal? Can't be worth it.
amir: ...Is it funny?
jake: Is what funny?
amir: The copies. Am I the office clown as of yet, do you think?
jake: Nothing's funny about this! It's self-mutilation, bud! And there are no copies.
amir: Where's the paper?
jake: You pressed "fax"! You're faxing a picture of your burned, bleeding asshole to my accountant.
amir: Then have him scan and email it back!
jake: It's a her, and no.
amir:  Chicks can't do math, dude.
jake: Don't be misogynistic. You're getting fucked by a copier.
amir: It's a five-in-one workstation! And fine, I'll-- I'll copy it. Here we go. Ready?
amir: What the butt is that? "PC Load Letter"?
jake: The drawer is empty.
amir: Will you insert paper to Tray 2?
jake: You should have looked before you--
amir: Will you insert paper to Tray 2?
jake: No! I will not! I will not do that. I'm not gonna help you.
amir: Fine. I'll do it without you.
jake: I'll do it. God, just stop.
amir: This-- this may kill me, sure, but, like with any tortured artist, my work will live beyond me.
amir: I shall be remembered as a martyr, a cool, and a philosopher. For I have the anus of a god.
amir: Perfect.
jake: Nobody even knows you did that. And you have to wear a diaper now.
amir: Worth it, baby!
jake: Oh God, you need new stitches.
amir: Yes.

INTRO
jake: Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir.
amir: I'm actually a little butthurt today!
jake: From what?
amir: Ow...
amir:  Here comes the dweeb... Here comes the dweeb!  Shittiest Weekend of the Ever Award goes to, dumroll please... Amir Hurwitz! "You like me! You really like me!" Friday night, I crash a feminist meeting, and told each and every one of them the God's honest truth: that they were all on the rag! Their aunt Flo didn't just come into town to visit. She moved in, and they were becoming scissor sisters. I wish one thing led to another, because what happened next was all at once. They tied my wrists to my face, shoved a tampon in my asshole, and kicked me out into the street! Keep in mind, this was 7:45 PM, so it's still bright out and I'm missing Jeopardy! I will take "Things You Don't Want Your Parents to See after Leaving a Restaurant for Their Forty-Second Anniversary" for, let's say, two hundred, Alex.  Doo doo doo doo-doo doo doo doooo... doo doo doo doo doo, ba-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo doo doo doo-doo doo doo doooo... doo, doo-doo doo doo--  --doo--  --doo. Bom, bom. What is their thirty-one-year-old son scooting across the sidewalk like a baby in a diaper, trying to grind the tampon out of his bleeding asshole while he howls at the moon like a wolf! Ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding! And what did you wager, Alex? Zero dollars? That's... that's funny, 'cause that's how much my life was worth to the police officer who, rather than unbind me, took out his Motorola Krzr and added me to his SnapStory. What? Just as I start to think outside the bun, you know, convincing myself that at the very least this will be a fun little anecdote to tell at my bachelor party-- if I don't decide to go stag to my own wedding-- four of these femmes fatales emerge from the shadows,  and start assaulting my face,  my body,  and my neck. All of them had hair of gold,  like their mother... the youngest one threw squirrels! One landed in my mouth, like a furry ball gag. Finally, out of fear, loathing, or Las Vegas, I j--  I just start spray-shitting everywhere. Yeah, it's like someone's dumping bucket after bucket of chocolate pudding on a rotating helicopter blade. I am defecating hither and thither, still howling, still at the moon, this time blue corn. With the tampon finally out, hands still tied to my face,  I finally have the wherewithalrighty then! to let out on more zinger. One more joke, this one luckily not at their expense. It's-- it's pretty broad, actually.  It goes a little something like this: A woman boards a bus with her newborn baby, and the bus driver says, "Hey, ma'am, that's the ugliest baby I've ever seen." The woman, appalled-- frankly, she has the right to be-- sits down next to me and says, "That bus driver just insulted me." I said, "Lady, you don't have to take that from him. You go up there and tell him off. Here, I'll hold your monkey."
amir: Seeing you chuckle at that joke made the entire weekend worthwhile.
jake: Oh-- no. Paul's cousin texted me something funny.
amir: Yeah? Well my asshole needs stitches! So start laughin', buster!

amir: Hi, you and the NSA are watching Jake and Amir!
jake: Paranoid.
amir: Hi, Obama!
jake: Delusions of grandeur.
amir: Hmm! Congrats, grad!
jake: Bad clap.
amir: You're getting the new iPhone! Amazing!
jake: It's 12:14, you just got here thirty seconds ago, and you're already ready to interrupt the day.
amir:  By the way, there's no such thing as a "free upgrade".
jake: Yo have the worst hands I've ever seen on a man.
amir:  Because you're paying for your shit--
jake: Keep them under the desk.
amir:  --with your privacy!
jake: Don't take a stance anymore. On anything.
amir: You know Steve Jobs spies on you, right? That every little camera on that phone is a peephole for Jobs to peep your peep while you sleep?
jake: Steve Jobs is dead.
amir: Good.
jake: Ass.
amir: You know the iPhone 6 actually has a bigger screen.  All the better to spee you with, my dear!
jake: "Spee"?
amir: Spee and sy!
jake: "Spee and sy"?
amir: Spee and spy!
jake: "Spee and spy".
amir: See and sy!
jake: Still, you're using the word "spee", so what are you mixing it with?
amir: Spee and sy-- see and spy!
jake: "See and spy".
amir: As in, be inspired... fuckward!
jake: ...What?
amir: Let me shatter your perfect world for a second. Every time you had phone sex on that phone of yours, it was actually an orgy. A group orgy. Yeah, there's not just corporate spies on the line, man! There's legit frickin' government agendas reading your sex and getting off to every adjective! "What are you wearing?" I'll tell you what it is! It's the new Apple iCloak!  But it's not invisibility, it's actually visibility! AKA, the visible ability... for Apple Geniuses... to get off! Jerk off! Nut to you! 
jake: Shut up! What's funny? Why do you believe this, and why would you be amused?
amir: Smile!  You're on Dipshit Camera! I just got a picture of the biggest dumbass I know.
jake: Was it a selfie?
amir: Fuck off. What's that supposed to mean, "was it a selfie"?
jake: It's a joke. Come on.
amir:  When we designed the new iPhone, we had one facet that had to be absolutely necessary, and that was the fact that we wanted to jerk off!
jake: Your dick's actually out!
amir: So we put a camera here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, everywhere! 
jake: There are just two cameras. Alright? Stop adding your own cameras. By the way, you have an iPhone. You're holding it right now.
amir: Mine's jailbroken, you fucking idiot! It's running Linux, Java!
jake: Is your social security card taped to the back of it?
amir: Mm-hmm! Mm-hmm! You know why? So that I don't lose it, dipshit!
jake: You're a dipshit. I never even said I wanted the new iPhone.
amir: Good. 'Cause every front-facing camera, of which there are probably a baker's dozen--
jake: There aren't.
amir: --is a glory hole for Jobs, Woz, and Spielberg to fuck you with.
jake: You think Steve Spielberg wants to fuck you through the front-facing camera of your iPhone?
amir: I didn't say it.
jake: You're paranoid-- you did say it. You're delusional.
amir: I'm serious.
jake: I know you're serious. You're also horny or something, 'cause you keep on talking about masturbating.
amir: You don't get it! You got your iMac, your iCloud, your iPad, your iPod... it's all I I I! Ay-ay-ay! It should be you!  It should be you, you, you!
jake: You are ugly.
amir: Ouch.
amir:  It's here, it's here!
jake: Is that an iPhone?
amir:  Yeah, but I'm gonna hack it!
